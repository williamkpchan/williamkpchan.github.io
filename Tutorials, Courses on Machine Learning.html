<h1 itemprop="name" class="entry-title">16 New Must Watch Tutorials, Courses on Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of us fail to acknowledge that Youtube has a massive resource center of machine learning tutorials which are free to access. You no longer need to wait for launch of new MOOCs to learn a new concept. Search it on YouTube and chance are high that you&#8217;ll find it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, we published an article on <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/top-youtube-videos-machine-learning-neural-network-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top YouTube videos</a> featuring best ever videos on neural networks, deep learning &amp; machine learning. No doubt, videos are enriching. But, it happens that content (video, text) gets outdated overtime. Now is the time to update your knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wrote this article to help you discover new tools, techniques, methods, practices undertaken in machine learning since last year. Always remember, the pursuit of knowledge is similar to the life of fresh water. Never stop the flow and get a perennial fresh stream of perspectives.</p>

<h2>Are these tutorials meant for me?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depends! if you are curious and want to learn something new or enhance your skill sets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve categorized the videos in 4 principal sections, making sure that each one of you gets to learn something new. However, python users have more to learn. You&#8217;ll find full lectures, practical workshops, short talks indicating the increased dominance of machine learning in real world. Alongside, you&#8217;ll also learn how machine learning is solving real world problems at Google, Pinterest &amp; TaxiGrab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you plan to watch them, make a schedule. Don&#8217;t do it all in a day. Remember, the motive is not to just watch the videos, but to understand what is being taught. It takes time and discipline. Also to help you save time, I&#8217;ve provided a short summary below every video to help you decide if that&#8217;s what you should watch!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Personally to me, it is surprising to see how machine learning can solve business problems at different levels. One such example is how Grab Taxi uses machine learning to tackle the problem of taxi availability. To handle this problem, Grab started a unique initiative of bidding for a ride by the drivers and the fastest bidder wins and is assigned the ride. Watch the full video to find out how they used machine learning to build a predictive model on drivers bidding probability and used real time data to solve the problem.</p>
