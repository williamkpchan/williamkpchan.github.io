<h1>Run R code from JavaScript</h1>

<p>How about <a href="http://gitorious.org/r-node">R-node</a> ?</p>

<p>I think another alterative would be to use <strong>node.js</strong> as a server (<a href="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</a>) and call R from within as a child process, search the Node.js API docs for specifics.</p>

<p>Note: <strong>node</strong> can run any JS script(s) you may have, they don't necessarily need to be node-specific.</p>

<p>If you're ok with having the R code run on a server, then you should take a look at <a href="https://www.opencpu.org/">OpenCPU</a>. It provides a REST API and corresponding JavaScript library for sending R code to the server and getting the results back. In particular, it takes care of the security problems that can arise from running R as a server (R code can run arbitrary shell commands, among other things). There are public demo instances that you can use to try it out, and <a href="http://ramnathv.github.io/posts/making-rcharts-live-app/index.html">this page</a> provides a simple tutorial.</p>
