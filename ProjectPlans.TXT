=======
Recent Project Objective:
Start the monitoring process
	read AllLastVal, 
	Loop: Peek status, compare last value,report status

	compare criteria: C > last C, Vol?
	multiple criterias: case 1 case 2...

Process the A & HK STK List

Check 50 big U/D to locate trend and sectors

statistics of the 9 sectors

# ====
Continous monitoring and plot
HK Mon Completed, Start to process A
Monitoring jobs for diffrerent sectors and areas can be established, A, B, gold, oil, GEM, ETF...
Further Monotoring standards and rules can be established and scripts can be set up

Monotoring rules : big vol, big amt,rise above bar

TargetMonitoring!!

detect and report peridical changes

# ====
Enter a code, just monitor this dedicated status changes

# ====
prepare list of all data files and calculate trends
--modify reawebpage to get multiple pages according to a list 
  and then create a chop body loop
apply(X,INDEX,FUN=)
	a vector or array or list of values obtained by applying a function FUN to margins (INDEX) of X
lapply(X,FUN)
	apply FUN to each element of the list X
tapply(X,INDEX,FUN=)
	apply FUN to each cell of a ragged array given by X with indexes INDEX
by(data,INDEX,FUN)
	apply FUN to data frame data subsetted by INDEX
merge(a,b)
	merge two data frames by common columns or row names
xtabs(a b,data=x)
	a contingency table from cross-classifying factors
aggregate(x,by,FUN)
	splits the data frame x into subsets, computes summary statistics for each,
	and returns the result in a convenient form;
	by is a list of grouping elements, each as long as the variables in x
stack(x, ...)
	transform data available as separate columns in a data frame or list into a single column
unstack(x, ...)
	inverse of stack()
reshape(x, ...)
	reshapes a data frame between wide format with repeated measurements in separate columns
	of the same record and long format with the repeated measurements in separate records;
	use (direction=wide or (direction=long)

Some Other Simple Actions
=========================
-Simple Actions: 
# This is different for every address, 
# so this will be standalone, not general!
# This will be set as a template!

	Copy Address & Paste
	Read page
	ChopHeadTail, Head and tail are hardcoded
	Recreate(conversions) new page(or pages)
	Open the new page

-Simple Actions:
	Copy & Paste
	Convert to HTML links
	Save to file



The Process Plan
================
Use FetchKline to calculate the trend value, after day trade close, this will take time, result will be stored in a list for alarm trigger next trade day.

FetchKline

DynamCurv and store the table
	a table will be stored to record Daily Data, 
	furthermore indirect addressing should be considered, HLCV

PeekStatus and update the last value
	the latest values will be substituted in the Kline table

CalcLastPtVal
	calculation of the latest trend data

Comparison and alert
	to compare the latest value according to the set of rules, and report the status
	set of rules: 

loop to peek


This is the list of functions installed
====================
FetchKline <- function(onecode){
DynamCurv <- function(PDataSet, RegrPeriod){
CalcTrend <- function(PDataSet, RegrPeriod, StartP, LastPTR)
mysd = function(theVec, thePoint) {
TrendValue <- function(PDataSet, DataStart, DataEnd){
CalcLastPtVal <- function(CDataSet){
PeekStatus <- function(onecode){
PeekAStatus <- function(onecode){

FetchDataSet = FetchKline(onecode)
theLastPtValTable = CalcLastPtVal(FetchDataSet)
newData = PeekStatus(onecode)
FetchDataSet[160, c("Close", "High", "Low", "Vol")] = newData[c("NewPrice", "High", "Low", "Vol")]
theLastPtValTable = CalcLastPtVal(FetchDataSet)

CodeTable=readLines("QuoteCode.txt")		# note! must be in char, cannot be numeric
DispData <- function(onecode, UD, price, Diff, H, L, Vol, Amt){
QuotePrice <- function(onecode){
MultiQuote <- function(CodeTable){



R reminder
#===========
Cannot find the time event driven command in R language
EventName
Alarm	on or off
Date
Time	24hr format
Repeat	yes or not
RepTime	minutes, hour, day, week, month
Action	Show Msg or Play AlertSound or Call Application

Read EventTable



=======================
daily bbg detection

preparation: prepare prevData and ma60Amt
and store result

load prev data: prevData
cal ma amt: ma60Amt
loop:
check new data
compare prevData and stcAmt with rule
	if ok give alarm
wait

1 write preprocess script
2 write daily bbg
