      <p class="tab">Specifying /NODE allows processes to be created in a way that leverages memory locality on NUMA systems.  For example, two processes that communicate with each other heavily through shared memory can be created to share the same preferred NUMA node to minimize memory latencies.  They allocate memory from the same NUMA node when possible, and they are free to run on processors outside the specified node.</p>

      <p class="tab">If Command Extensions are enabled, external command invocation
        through the command line or the START command changes as follows:</p>
      <p class="tab">non-executable files may be invoked through their file association just
        by typing the name of the file as a command.  (e.g.  WORD.DOC would
        launch the application associated with the .DOC file extension).
        See the ASSOC and FTYPE commands for how to create these
        associations from within a command script.</p>
      <p class="tab">When executing an application that is a 32-bit GUI application, CMD.EXE
        does not wait for the application to terminate before returning to
        the command prompt.  This new behavior does NOT occur if executing
        within a command script.</p>
      <p class="tab">When executing a command line whose first token is the string &quot;CMD&quot;         without an extension or path qualifier, then &quot;CMD&quot; is replaced with
        the value of the COMSPEC variable.  This prevents picking up CMD.EXE
        from the current directory.</p>
      <p class="tab">When executing a command line whose first token does NOT contain an
        extension, then CMD.EXE uses the value of the PATHEXT
        environment variable to determine which extensions to look for
        and in what order.  The default value for the PATHEXT variable
        is:</p>
      <p class="tab"> .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD</p>
      <p class="tab"> Notice the syntax is the same as the PATH variable, with
        semicolons separating the different elements.</p>
      <p class="tab">When searching for an executable, if there is no match on any extension,
        then looks to see if the name matches a directory name.  If it does, the
        START command launches the Explorer on that path.  If done from the       command line, it is the equivalent to doing a CD /D to that path.</p>
