<h1>JavaScript and the SHELL Command</h1></center>
<div id="toc"><ul></ul></div><br>


Because HTML runs in a browser, and because of the inherent, built-in security of browsers, it's difficult to call other programs from within HTML code. But sometimes you need to. What's the solution? Java Script and SHELL!</p>

<p><b>The SHELL Command</b></p>

<p>In this article, I'll show you how to use the SHELL API from within HTML to perform several common functions. If you want to learn more about the syntax of the SHELL command, take a look at the Microsoft's Web site. Just search on <i>SHELLEXECUTE</i>, and you'll find pages and pages about the SHELL API, its syntax, and how to use it. 
</p>

<p>SHELL is an ActiveX API. That is, SHELL has certain properties and methods that are exposed, or are public, which you can access from your own applications. SHELL also follows the Component Object Model, or COM, method of access, which means, among other things, that it has certain standard behaviors. You can take advantage of these standard behaviors in your own HTML applications. To do so, you'll need to write a little bit of JavaScript. 
</p>

<p><b>JavaScript and SHELL</b>
</p>

<p>If you've read some of the other JavaScript articles in <i>Midrange Programmer</i>, you're probably pretty proficient at using JavaScript by now. If you're not, you may want to go back and read those <a target=new href="http://www.itjungle.com/mpo/mpoindex.html">articles</a> again, just to get familiar with it. For this article, we're going to write some JavaScript in order to demonstrate how to use the SHELL ActiveX object to execute commands on your PC. 
</p>

<p>To start, open up Microsoft Notepad.exe and create a new HTML document.
</p>

<pre class="courier9pt">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;

&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;FORM name="Form1"&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Execute PC Commands From HTML &lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;File Name to Open:&gt; &lt;Input type="text" 
   name="filename"/&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Input type="Button" name="Button1" 
   value="Run Notepad.exe" /&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Input type="Button" name="Button2" 
   value="Run Notepad.exe with Parameters" /&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>

<p>Save this document with a name like <i>DemoSHELLAPI.htm</i> and then open it in a browser. It should look something like the one shown here:
</p>

<p>At this point, your HTML code doesn't do anything, because you haven't added any code behind it. Let's do that now. 
</p>

<p><b>Adding the Power</b></p>

<p>To use the SHELL API, you'll need to write a JavaScript function and define the SHELL API parameters within it. And you'll need to execute the function for when the user clicks a button.
</p>

<p>Modify the DemoSHELLAPI.htm file to add the following code between the opening and closing HEAD tags:
</p>

<pre class="courier9pt">
&lt;SCRIPT type="text/javascript" LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
  function executeCommands(inputparms)
   {
  // Instantiate the Shell object and invoke 
   its execute method.

    var oShell = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application");

    var commandtoRun = "C:\\Winnt\\Notepad.exe";
    if (inputparms != "")
     {
      var commandParms = document.Form1.filename.value;
     }

 // Invoke the execute method.  
     oShell.ShellExecute(commandtoRun, commandParms, 
	  "", "open", "1");
  }
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

Modify your buttons, in the BODY of the text to add the 
   "onClick" event to each.

&lt;input type="Button" name="Button1" 
   value="Run Notepad.exe" onClick="executeCommands()" /&gt;

&lt;input type="Button" name="Button2" 
   value="Run Notepad.exe with Parameters" 
      onClick="executeCommands(' + hasPARMS + ')" /&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>What That Does</b>
</p>

<p>Here's what this JavaScript does.
</p>

<p>First, it accepts a parameter from whatever HTML element calls it. In this case, the JavaScript is executed when the user clicks one of the buttons on the HTML form. 
</p>

<p>Next, the JavaScript will instantiate the ActiveX object <i>Shell.application</i>. This is the SHELL API. The instantiated object is then assigned to the variable named <i>oShell</i>. Incidentally, you can instantiate most ActiveX objects from within HTML in this manner.
</p>

<p>Next, we'll set the value <i>commandtoRun</i> to the value of the command we want to execute, in this case <i>Notepad.exe</i>. Notice that there are two backslashes (\\) between each path parameter. This is required because, if you only used a single backslash in the path, JavaScript would interpret that single script as an operator. By making the command you wish to execute a variable, you can easily modify your HTML code so that you execute whatever command the user chooses from your HTML form. This will give you a lot of flexibility in your applications.
</p>

<p>Next, if the user clicked the button to run NotePad.exe and to pass it a parameter of the name of a file to open, then the variable <i>inputparms</i> will contain the value <i>hasParms</i>, which is defined in the "onClick" event of the second button on this Form. If <i>inputparms</i> is not blank, the script will retrieve the value the user entered in the input field on the form and set the variable <i>commandParms</i> equal to that value. 
</p>

<p>Finally, we'll execute the command to run, Notepad.exe, by calling the ShellExecute method of the SHELL API. We'll pass the ShellExecute method several parameters, each individually enclosed within double quotation marks ("). The first parameter is the command to be executed, in this case Notepad.exe. The second parameters are the input parameters, if any, to the command. The other parameters are not important to this discussion, but if you're interested in using them, be sure to check out the SHELL documentation on Microsoft's Web site. 
</p>

<p>Save this file and reopen it in your browser and try it out. 
</p>

<p><b>Powerful Functions</b>
</p>

<p>Using ActiveX objects from within HTML gives you the power and flexibility you need to code professional and useful applications. Explore the SHELL API and some of the other Win32 APIs and see how you can expand on them to add even more power to your applications.

The problem is  it give error..."Permission denied."<br>
<br>
Answers<br>
It's necessary to have two settings turned on.<br>
<br>
Enable unsigned ActiveX controls for the current zone <br>
Tools > Internet Options > Security > Custom level... <br>
Enable "ActiveX Controls and plug-ins" > "Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting" <br>
<br>
Allow Active Content to run files <br>
Tools > Internet Options > Advanced > Security Enable "Allow Active Content to run in files on My Computer" <br>
<br>
You may experience a "Permission denied" error, which means that the browser will not let script execute outside the "sandbox". Try solving the issue by changing a security setting in the browser:<br>
<br>
Internet Options, Advanced, Security:<br>
"Allow Active Content to run in files on My Computer"<br>
The above is for IE, but most browsers have similar options.<br>

<script>
  $(function() {
    var toc = $('#toc>ul');

    function makeLi(text, href) {
      return $('<li><a href="' + href + '" target="_self">' + text + '</a></li>');
    }

    $('p>b').each(function(i) {
      var chapter = $(this), chapterNumber = i + 1;
      toc.append(
        makeLi(chapter.text(), '#chapter-' + chapterNumber)
      );
      chapter.attr('id', 'chapter-' + chapterNumber);
    });

  });
</script>
</body>
</html>
