<BR> <P> <B>Welcome To<br> JavaScript for the
Total Non-Programmer</B><P>
 
This tutorial will take you step by step through the fundamentals of Javascript.  You will learn how to write functions, use data from text boxes, create IF-THEN
conditionals, program loops, and generally make your web page "smarter."
<P>
I teach computer classes for a living to corporate clients of all levels.
After 2 years of teaching, I have learned a lot about communication between people of various levels of computer experience.   This tutorial assumes that you have
no prior programming experience, but that you have created your own HTML pages.
<P>
If you find this tutorial helpful, please let me know (it's my only reward).  Also, links are graciously accepted.<P>
<B>What is JavaScript?</B><P>
Javascript is an easy-to-use programming language that can be embedded in the header of your web pages.  It can enhance the dynamics and interactive features
of your page by allowing you to perform calculations, check forms, write interactive games, add special effects, customize graphics selections, create security
passwords and more.<P>
 
<B>What's the difference between JavaScript and Java?</B><P>
Actually, the 2 languages have almost nothing in common except for the name.
Although Java is technically an interpreted programming language, it is coded in a similar fashion to C++, with 
separate header and class files, compiled together
prior to execution.  It is powerful enough to write major applications and insert them in a web page as a
special object called an "applet."  Java has been generating a lot of excitment because of its unique ability to run the same program on IBM, Mac, and Unix
computers.  Java is not considered an easy-to-use  language for non-programmers.
<P>
Javascript is much simpler to use than Java.  With Javascript, if I want check a form for errors, I just type an <A
HREF="javascript:NewWindow('IfThen.htm')">if-then</A> statement at the top of my page.  No compiling, no applets, just a simple sequence.<P>
<B>What is Object Oriented Programming?</B><P>
Everyone that wants to program JavaScript should at least try reading the following section.  If you have trouble understanding it, don't worry. The best way to
learn JavaScript is from the examples presented in this tutorial.  After you have been through the lessons, come back to this page and read it again.<P>
 
OOP is a programming technique (note: not a language structure - you
don't even need an object-oriented language to program in an
object-oriented fashion) designed to simplify complicated programming
concepts. In essence, object-oriented programming revolves around the
idea of user- and system-defined chunks of data, and controlled means
of accessing and modifying those chunks.
<P>
Object-oriented programming consists of Objects, Methods and
Properties. An <em><U>object</U></em> is basically a black box which stores
some information. It may have a way for you to read that information
and a way for you to write to, or change, that information. It may
also have other less obvious ways of interacting with the
information.
<P>
Some of the information in the object may actually be directly
accessible; other information may require you to use a <em><U>method</U></em>
to access it - perhaps because the way the information is stored
internally is of no use to you, or because only certain things can be
written into that information space and the object needs to check that
you're not going outside those limits.
<P>
The directly accessible bits of information in the object are its
<em><U>properties</U></em>. The difference between data accessed via
properties and data accessed via methods is that with properties, you
see exactly what you're doing to the object; with methods, unless you
created the object yourself, you just see the effects of what you're
doing.<P>
Other Javascript pages you read will probably refer frequently to objects, events, methods, and properties.  This tutorial will teach by example, without focusing too
heavily on OOP vocabulary. However, you will need a basic understanding of these terms to use other JavaScript references.<P>
 
<B>Objects and Properties</B><P>
Your web page document is an object.  Any table, form, button, image, or link on your page is also an object.  Each object has certain properties (information about
the object).  For example, the background color of your document is written <B>document.bgcolor</B>.  You would change the color of your page to red by writing
the line:  <FONT COLOR="0000DD"> document.bgcolor="red"</FONT><P>
 
The contents (or value)  of a textbox named "password" in a form named "entryform" is <B>document.entryform.password.value</B>. <P>
<b>Methods</b><P>
Most objects have a certain collection of things that they can <b>do</b>.  Different objects can do different things, just as a door can open and close, while a light
can turn on and off.  A new document is opened with the method <b>document.open()</b>  You can write "Hello World" into a document by typing
<b>document.write("Hello World")</b> .  <B>open()</B> and <B>write()</B> are both <I><U>methods</U></I> of the object: document. <P>
<b>Events</b><br>
Events are how we trigger our functions to run.  The easiest example is a button, whose definition includes the words <b>onClick="run_my_function()"</b>.  The
onClick event, as its name implies, will run the function when the user clicks on the button.  Other events include OnMouseOver, OnMouseOut, OnFocus, OnBlur,
OnLoad, and OnUnload.
<P>

<SCRIPT>
function MsgBox(textstring) {
  alert(textstring);
}
</SCRIPT>
<B>Chapter 1, The Message Box</B><P>
This is a very simple script.  It opens up an alert message box which
displays whatever is typed in the form box below.   <P>

Type something in the box.  Then click "Show Me"
<form>
<INPUT NAME="text1" TYPE=Text>
<INPUT NAME="submit" TYPE=Button VALUE="Show Me" onClick="MsgBox(form.text1.value)">
</form><P>

Here's the entire page, minus my comments.  Take a few minutes to learn as much
as you can from this, then I'll break it down into smaller pieces.
