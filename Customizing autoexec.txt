Customizing autoexec.nt and config.nt

You can choose to further configure the MS-DOS and Windows 3.x environment by modifying Windows 7's equivalent of the old CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. These files are called config.nt and autoexec.nt and are used to configure each DOS VDM when it starts up. Just remember:

The files CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT in your hard drive's root folder are completely ignored by Windows 7. If they're there at all, it's only to fool really old applications that won't run unless they see that these files exist.
The files config.nt and autoexec.nt in windowssystem32 are used, but only when Windows needs to start up an MS-DOS or Windows 3.x application. Any change to these files will take effect the next time you start the application -- you don't need to restart Windows.
