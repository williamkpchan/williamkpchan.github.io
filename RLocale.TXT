Handling of .Rprofile

When starting RStudio in an alternate working directory the .Rprofile file located within that directory is sourced. If (and only if) there is not an .Rprofile file in the alternate directory then the global default profile (e.g. ~/.Rprofile) is sourced instead.


In Windows, you set the R_USER profile by opening up a command line and running:

SETX R_PROFILE_USER "C:/.../.Rprofile"



Customizing Startup
R will always source the Rprofile.site file first. 
On Windows, the file is in the C:\Program Files\R\R-n.n.n\etc directory. 
You can also place a .Rprofile file in any directory that you are going to run R from or in the user home directory.
At startup, R will source the Rprofile.site file. 
It will then look for a .Rprofile file to source in the current working directory. If it doesn't find it, it will look for one in the user's home directory. There are two special functions you can place in these files. 
.First( ) will be run at the start of the R session and 
.Last( ) will be run at the end of the session.
