<h1>How to Round Off Numbers in R</h1>

<p>Although R can calculate accurately to up to 16 digits, you don&#8217;t always want to use that many digits. In this case, you can use a couple functions in R to round numbers. To round a number to two digits after the decimal point, for example, use the <span class="code">round()</span> function as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; round(123.456,digits=2)
[1] 123.46</pre>
<p>You also can use the <span class="code">round()</span> function to round numbers to multiples of 10, 100, and so on. For that, you just add a negative number as the digits argument:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; round(-123.456,digits=-2)
[1] -100</pre>
<p>If you want to specify the number of significant digits to be retained, regardless of the size of the number, you use the <span class="code">signif()</span> function instead:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; signif(-123.456,digits=4)
[1] -123.5</pre>
<p>Both <span class="code">round()</span> and <span class="code">signif()</span> round numbers to the nearest possibility. So, if the first digit that&#8217;s dropped is smaller than 5, the number is rounded down. If it&#8217;s bigger than 5, the number is rounded up.</p>
<p>If the first digit that is dropped is exactly 5, R uses a rule that&#8217;s common in programming languages: Always round to the nearest even number. <span class="code">round(1.5)</span> and <span class="code">round(2.5)</span> both return <span class="code">2</span>, for example, and <span class="code">round(-4.5)</span> returns <span class="code">-4</span>.</p>
<p>Contrary to <span class="code">round()</span>, three other functions always round in the same direction:</p>
<ul class="level-one">
 <li><p class="first-para"><span class="code">floor(x)</span> rounds to the nearest integer that&#8217;s smaller than <span class="code">x</span>. So <span class="code">floor(123.45)</span> becomes 123 and <span class="code">floor(-123.45)</span> becomes &#8211;124.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p class="first-para"><span class="code">ceiling(x)</span> rounds to the nearest integer that&#8217;s larger than <span class="code">x</span>. This means <span class="code">ceiling (123.45)</span> becomes 124 and <span class="code">ceiling(123.45)</span> becomes &#8211;123.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p class="first-para"><span class="code">trunc(x)</span> rounds to the nearest integer in the direction of 0. So <span class="code">trunc(123.65)</span> becomes 123 and <span class="code">trunc(-123.65)</span> becomes &#8211;123.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
