<h2>Introduction</h2>

<aside>Read <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials">more tutorials</a>.</aside>

<b>D3</b> allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. 
For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. 
Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.

D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. 

Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data. 
This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. 
With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. 
D3's functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/API-Reference">components</a> and <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins">plugins</a>.

<h2>Selections</h2>

<aside>Read <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Selections">more about selections</a>.</aside>

Modifying documents using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR">W3C DOM API</a> is tedious: the method names are verbose, and the imperative approach requires manual iteration and bookkeeping of temporary state. 
For example, to change the text color of paragraph elements:

<code>var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
for (var i = 0; i &lt; paragraphs.length; i++) {
var paragraph = paragraphs.item(i);
paragraph.style.setProperty("color", "white", null);
}</code>

D3 employs a declarative approach, operating on arbitrary sets of nodes called <i>selections</i>. 
For example, you can rewrite the above loop as:

<code>d3.selectAll("p").style("color", "white");</code>

Yet, you can still manipulate individual nodes as needed:

<code>d3.select("body").style("background-color", "black");</code>

Selectors are defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/">W3C Selectors API</a> and supported natively by modern browsers. 
Backwards-compatibility for older browsers can be provided by <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/">Sizzle</a>. 
The above examples select nodes by tag name (<code>"p"</code> and <code>"body"</code>, respectively). 
Elements may be selected using a variety of predicates, including containment, attribute values, class and ID.

D3 provides numerous methods for mutating nodes: setting attributes or styles; registering event listeners; adding, removing or sorting nodes; and changing HTML or text content. 
These suffice for the vast majority of needs. 
Direct access to the underlying DOM is also possible, as each D3 selection is simply an array of nodes.

<h2>Dynamic Properties</h2>

Readers familiar with other DOM frameworks such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> or <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> should immediately recognize similarities with D3. 
Yet styles, attributes, and other properties can be specified as <i>functions of data</i> in D3, not just simple constants. 
Despite their apparent simplicity, these functions can be surprisingly powerful; the <code>d3.geo.path</code> function, for example, projects <a href="http://geojson.org/">geographic coordinates</a> into SVG <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData">path data</a>. 
D3 provides many built-in reusable functions and function factories, such as <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes">graphical primitives</a> for area, line and pie charts.

For example, to randomly color paragraphs:

<code>d3.selectAll("p").style("color", function() {
  return "hsl(" + Math.random() * 360 + ",100%,50%)";
});</code>

To alternate shades of gray for even and odd nodes:

<code>d3.selectAll("p").style("color", function(d, i) {
  return i % 2 ? "#fff" : "#eee";
});</code>

Computed properties often refer to bound data. 
Data is specified as an array of values, and each value is passed as the first argument (<code>d</code>) to selection functions. 
With the default join-by-index, the first element in the data array is passed to the first node in the selection, the second element to the second node, and so on. 
For example, if you bind an array of numbers to paragraph elements, you can use these numbers to compute dynamic font sizes:

<code>d3.selectAll("p")
.data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
  .style("font-size", function(d) { return d + "px"; });</code>

Once the data has been bound to the document, you can omit the <code>data</code> operator; D3 will retrieve the previously-bound data. 
This allows you to recompute properties without rebinding.

<h2>Enter and Exit</h2>

<aside>Read <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">more about data joins</a>.</aside>

Using D3's <i>enter</i> and <i>exit</i> selections, you can create new nodes for incoming data and remove outgoing nodes that are no longer needed.

When data is bound to a selection, each element in the data array is paired with the corresponding node in the selection. 
If there are fewer nodes than data, the extra data elements form the enter selection, which you can instantiate by appending to the <code>enter</code> selection. 
For example:

<code>d3.select("body")
.selectAll("p")
.data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
.enter().append("p")
  .text(function(d) { return "I'm number " + d + "!"; });</code>

Updating nodes are the default selection—the result of the <code>data</code> operator. 
Thus, if you forget about the enter and exit selections, you will automatically select only the elements for which there exists corresponding data. 
A common pattern is to break the initial selection into three parts: the updating nodes to modify, the entering nodes to add, and the exiting nodes to remove.

<code>// Update…
var p = d3.select("body")
.selectAll("p")
.data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
  .text(function(d) { return d; });

// Enter…
p.enter().append("p")
  .text(function(d) { return d; });

// Exit…
p.exit().remove();</code>

By handling these three cases separately, you specify precisely which operations run on which nodes. 
This improves performance and offers greater control over transitions. 
For example, with a bar chart you might initialize entering bars using the old scale, and then transition entering bars to the new scale along with the updating and exiting bars.

D3 lets you transform documents based on data; this includes both creating and destroying elements. 
D3 allows you to change an existing document in response to user interaction, animation over time, or even asynchronous notification from a third-party. 
A hybrid approach is even possible, where the document is initially rendered on the server, and updated on the client via D3.

<h2>Transformation, not Representation</h2>

D3 does not introduce a new visual representation. 
Unlike <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphaël</a>, or <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis</a>, D3's vocabulary of graphical marks comes directly from web standards: HTML, SVG, and CSS. 
For example, you can create SVG elements using D3 and style them with external stylesheets. 
You can use composite filter effects, dashed strokes and clipping. 
If browser vendors introduce new features tomorrow, you'll be able to use them immediately—no toolkit update required. 
And, if you decide in the future to use a toolkit other than D3, you can take your knowledge of standards with you!

Best of all, D3 is easy to debug using the browser's built-in element inspector: the nodes that you manipulate with D3 are exactly those that the browser understands natively.

<h2>Transitions</h2>

D3's focus on transformation extends naturally to animated transitions. 
Transitions gradually interpolate styles and attributes over time. 
Tweening can be controlled via easing functions such as “elastic”, “cubic-in-out” and “linear”. 
D3's interpolators support both primitives, such as numbers and numbers embedded within strings (font sizes, path data, <i>etc.</i>), and compound values. 
You can even extend D3's interpolator registry to support complex properties and data structures.

For example, to fade the background of the page to black:

<code>d3.select("body").transition()
  .style("background-color", "black");</code>

Or, to resize circles in a symbol map with a staggered delay:

<code>d3.selectAll("circle").transition()
  .duration(750)
  .delay(function(d, i) { return i * 10; })
  .attr("r", function(d) { return Math.sqrt(d * scale); });</code>

By modifying only the attributes that actually change, D3 reduces overhead and allows greater graphical complexity at high frame rates. 
D3 also allows sequencing of complex transitions via events. 
And, you can still use CSS3 transitions; D3 does not replace the browser's toolbox, but exposes it in a way that is easier to use.

<h2>Thinking with Joins</h2>

Say you’re making a basic scatterplot using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, and you need to create some <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/shapes.html#CircleElement">SVG circle</a> elements to visualize your data. You may be surprised to discover that D3 has no primitive for creating multiple DOM elements. Wait, <b><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">WAT?</a></b>

Sure, there’s the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Selections#wiki-append">append</a> method, which you can use to create a single element.

Here <code>svg</code> refers to a single-element selection containing an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element created previously (or selected from the current page, say).

<code>svg.append("circle")
    .attr("cx", d.x)
    .attr("cy", d.y)
    .attr("r", 2.5);</code>

But that’s just a single circle, and you want <i>many</i> circles: one for each data point. Before you bust out a <code>for</code> loop and brute-force it, consider this mystifying sequence from one of D3’s examples.

Here <code>data</code> is an array of JSON objects with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties, such as: <code>[{"x": 1.0, "y": 1.1}, {"x": 2.0, "y": 2.5}, …]</code>.

<code>svg.selectAll("circle")
  .data(data)
  .enter().append("circle")
    .attr("cx", function(d) { return d.x; })
    .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.y; })
    .attr("r", 2.5);</code>

This code does exactly what you need: it creates a circle element for each data point, using the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> data properties for positioning. But what’s with the <code>selectAll("circle")</code>? Why do you have to select elements that you know don’t exist in order to create new ones? WAT.

Here’s the deal. Instead of telling D3 <i>how</i> to do something, tell D3 <i>what</i> you want. You want the circle elements to correspond to data. You want one circle per datum. Instead of instructing D3 to create circles, then, tell D3 that the selection <code>"circle"</code> should correspond to data. This concept is called the <i>data join</i>:

<svg width="720" height="240">
  <g transform="translate(0,128)">
    <g transform="translate(300)">
      <circle r="110" style="fill: rgb(49, 130, 189);"></circle>
      <text y="-120" dy=".35em" text-anchor="middle" style="font-weight: bold;">Data</text>
      <text x="-50" dy=".35em" text-anchor="middle">Enter</text>
    </g>
    <text x="360" dy=".35em" text-anchor="middle">Update</text>
    <g transform="translate(420)">
      <circle r="110" style="fill: rgb(230, 85, 13);"></circle>
      <text y="-120" dy=".35em" text-anchor="middle" style="font-weight: bold;">Elements</text>
      <text x="50" dy=".35em" text-anchor="middle">Exit</text>
    </g>
  </g>
</svg>

Data points joined to existing elements produce the <i>update</i> (inner) selection. Leftover unbound data produce the <i>enter</i> selection (left), which represents missing elements. Likewise, any remaining unbound elements produce the <i>exit</i> selection (right), which represents elements to be removed.

Now we can unravel the mysterious enter-append sequence through the data join:<ol>

<li>First, <code>svg.selectAll("circle")</code> returns a new empty selection, since the SVG container was empty. The parent node of this selection is the SVG container.

<li>This selection is then joined to an array of data, resulting in three new selections that represent the three possible states: <i>enter</i>, <i>update</i>, and <i>exit</i>. Since the selection was empty, the update and exit selections are empty, while the enter selection contains a placeholder for each new datum.

<li>The update selection is returned by <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_data"><i>selection</i>.data</a>, while the enter and exit selections hang off the update selection; <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_enter"><i>selection</i>.enter</a> thus returns the enter selection.

<li>The missing elements are added to the SVG container by calling <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_append"><i>selection</i>.append</a> on the enter selection. This appends a new circle for each data point to the SVG container.

</ol>Thinking with joins means declaring a relationship between a selection (such as <code>"circle"</code>) and data, and then implementing this relationship through the three <i>enter</i>, <i>update</i> and <i>exit</i> states.

But why all the trouble? Why not just a primitive to create multiple elements? The beauty of the data join is that it generalizes. While the above code only handles the <i>enter</i> selection, which is sufficient for static visualizations, you can extend it to support <a href="/mike/miserables/">dynamic</a> <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062085">visualizations</a> with only minor modifications for <i>update</i> and <i>exit</i>. And that means you can visualize <a href="/mike/path/">realtime data</a>, allow <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063663">interactive exploration</a>, and <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1256572">transition smoothly</a> between datasets!

Here’s an example of handling all three states:

<code>var circle = svg.selectAll("circle")
  .data(data);

circle.exit().remove();

circle.enter().append("circle")
    .attr("r", 2.5)
  .merge(circle)
    .attr("cx", function(d) { return d.x; })
    .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.y; });</code>

To control how data is assign&shy;ed to elements, you can pro&shy;vide a <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/">key function</a>.

Whenever this code is run, it recomputes the data join and maintains the desired correspondence between elements and data. If the new dataset is smaller than the old one, the surplus elements end up in the <i>exit</i> selection and get removed. If the new dataset is larger, the surplus data ends up in the <i>enter</i> selection and new nodes are added. If the new dataset is exactly the same size, then all the elements are simply updated with new positions, and no elements are added or removed.

Thinking with joins means your code is more <i>declarative</i>: you handle these three states without any branching (<code>if</code>) or iteration (<code>for</code>). Instead you describe how elements should correspond to data. If a given <i>enter</i>, <i>update</i> or <i>exit</i> selection happens to be empty, the corresponding code is a no-op.

Joins also let you target operations to specific states, if needed. For example, you can set constant attributes (such as the circle’s radius, defined by the <code>"r"</code> attribute) on enter rather than update. By reselecting elements and minimizing DOM changes, you vastly improve rendering performance! Similarly, you can target animated transitions to specific states. For example, for entering circles to expand-in:

<code>circle.enter().append("circle")
    .attr("r", 0)
  .transition()
    .attr("r", 2.5);</code>

Likewise, to shrink-out:

<code>circle.exit().transition()
    .attr("r", 0)
    .remove();</code>
