combine multiple htmls into one file

To remove materials between tags

1 use ultraedit to open file, remember to convert to unicode if chinese inside
2 remove ^p to allow find and replace over multiple lines
	if ^p is significant, use marker string to replace, and recover afterwards
3 use regular expression to remove material between tags


note the following code for trial
================
txt=readLines("all.htm",encoding = "big5")
sink("newall.htm")
cat(gsub("<script .*</script>", "", txt, perl=T))
sink()
