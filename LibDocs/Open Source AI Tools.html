<h2>8. NuPIC</h2>
Managed by a company called <a href="http://numenta.com/">Numenta</a>, <a href="http://numenta.org/">NuPIC</a> is an open source artificial intelligence project based on a theory called Hierarchical Temporal Memory, or HTM. Essentially, HTM is an attempt to create a computer system modeled after the human neocortex. The goal is to create machines that "approach or exceed human level performance for many cognitive tasks."<br><br>
In addition to the open source license, Numenta also offers NuPic under a commercial license, and it also offers licenses on the patents that underlie the technology.<br><br>
<h2>9. OpenNN</h2>
