<h1>Unlock a Secured PDF Document in Three Steps</h1>
<a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com/unlock_pdf" class="whitebut ">unlock pdf</a>

There are two types of passwords attached to PDF files.
The first type is going to prevent you from opening and viewing the file all together.
The second type is going to prevent you from doing anything other than opening the file.
This is the permissions password.
You will not be able to modify, copy, or print the PDF file without this password.

Fortunately, there are easy techniques and programs, like PDF Unlocker to unlock a secured PDF file from password restrictions.

<k>Step 3: Select the "Recovery Method" to crack the open password</k>
Now, you need to select the appropriate recovery method to crack the password of the protected PDF file.
Here the 4-recovery method, you can use to help the software guess the password of the protected PDF file:

<k>1.
Dictionary Attack: </k>If you have no clue about the password that is used to protect the PDF file, then you should start with the "Dictionary Attack" mode.
This mode utilizes a default dictionary which contains a large number of common passwords.
It often cracks the common passwords since most common passwords are covered by the available lists, created by various password generation techniques.

<k>2.
Combination Attack: </k>If you remember some parts of the password, then you should go with the "Combination Attack" method.
Suppose you know that the password Includes someone name like "Mark" and the number "1989" but don't remember the exact way they were used in the password, the you can choose this method and provide the information like this:
Uppercase Letters: M<br />
Lowercase Letters: a, r, k<br />
Numbers: 1, 9, 8<br />
<br />
You can increase the chances of password recovery even more by providing more information like the length of the password, symbols, prefixes &amp; suffixes, etc.
       


<k>3.
Dictionary Attack: </k>If you are only certain about the few parameters of the password, then you should go with the "Dictionary Attack." For instance, you know that you usually create a password between 9 to 10 characters without any numerical digits, but always add you birth month "November" in the password, then you should go like this:
Password Length: 9-10 characters<br />
Characters not included: numbers<br />
Characters or combinations of characters may be included: November

<k>4.
Brute Force Attack: </k>If you have no idea about the password that is set on the PDF file, then you should select the "Brute-Force Attack" method.
This method will apply all the possible password combinations to crack the password.
This method may take a long time depending upon the complexity of the password.
