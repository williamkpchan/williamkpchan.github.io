<h4 id="topic-2">- What is PHP, and why would I use it?</h4>
PHP is a server-side, cross-platform scripting language that can be embedded in HTML code. 
PHP-enabled web pages are handled just like regular HTML pages by web browsers, and you can create and edit PHP pages the same way you do for regular HTML pages. 
PHP syntax is similar to Perl and C.

PHP is a very popular scripting language for web development. 
It is free and open-source, and is installed by default with all of our hosting plans. 
Additionally:

PHP is a relatively easy language to learn. 
Programmers with backgrounds in languages such as C or Perl should have little problem learning PHP. 
There are also a large number of free online resources available.
PHP is a secure and stable scripting language. 
The open-source community is constantly improving PHP, as well as patching and fixing any bugs that are found.
PHP loads and runs quickly without slowing down other processes. 
This is because PHP runs in its own memory space.
PHP is flexible because it can connect to several different databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others.
PHP web hosting is cost-effective. 
Because PHP is open-source, there are no licensing fees associated with it.
Our Guru Crew technical support team are PHP specialists and very familiar with PHP-based sites. 
All of A2 Hosting's servers are configured to run PHP. 
Additionally, we provide many free PHP tools and applications that you can install with one click using cPanel, and you can choose from among several PHP versions in cPanel.

<h4 id="topic-4">- What permissions do I need to set for my PHP script files?</h4>
To avoid potential problems, you should set your PHP script file permissions to <strong>755</strong> (read, write, and execute permissions for the user, and read and execute permissions for the group and world).

<h4 id="topic-5">- Do I need to add a header (shebang) at the top of my PHP script files?</h4>
No. 
You do not need to add a <strong>#!/usr/bin/php</strong> header (shebang) to your PHP script files.

<h4 id="topic-6">- Can I use short tags in my PHP script files?</h4>
Yes, we have installed support for short tags with PHP. 
This means that you can write:

&lt;? echo "Hello world"; ?&gt;
Instead of:

&lt;?php echo "Hello world"; ?&gt;
<h4 id="topic-7">- What is the path to the PHP executable?</h4>
The absolute path to the PHP executable on A2 Hosting's servers is <strong>/usr/bin/php</strong>. 
The /usr/bin directory is in the default path, so generally you do not need to include the full path when you run PHP scripts from the command line. 
Just type the following command, replacing <em>filename</em> with the name of your script file:

php filename
However, if you want to run an alternate PHP version from the command line, you must specify the full path to the executable. 
To see the PHP versions that are available on your account, type the following command:

ls /opt/php
Each PHP version has its own directory in the <strong>/opt/php</strong> directory, and the PHP executable is located in the version's <strong>bin </strong>directory. 
For example, if you want to run a file named <em>test.php</em> from the command line using PHP version 5.5, type the following command:

/opt/php/php-5.5.0/bin/php test.php
<h4 id="topic-8">- What version of PHP is installed on my account?</h4>
Currently, you can use PHP version 4.4, 5.x, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4.

To determine the command-line PHP version currently installed on your account, type the following command at the command prompt:
php -v
To determine the PHP version that the Apache web server uses to process web pages on your site, log in to cPanel, and in the <span class="UI">Software/Services</span> section of the home screen, click <span class="UI">PHP Version</span>. 
You can also change the PHP version that Apache uses for web site files on this page.

On an&nbsp;unmanaged VPS or Flex Dedicated Server, you can install any version of PHP that you want.
<h4 id="topic-9">- What file extensions can I use for my PHP script files?</h4>
The default file extension for PHP script files is <strong>.php</strong>. 
However, you can define additional PHP script file extensions in an .htaccess file. 
For example, the following line demonstrates how to define the file extension .html for PHP script files:

AddHandler application/x-httpd-lsphp .html
The AddHandler directive above works with most Managed and Core plans. 
It does not work with Windows plans.
For more information about how to use .htaccess files, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/apache-web-server/using-htaccess-files">this article</a>.

<h4 id="topic-10">- Do you run PHP in safe mode?</h4>
No, we do not run PHP on our shared servers with <strong>safe_mode</strong> enabled, because it can cause issues for scripts. 
Additionally, safe mode is deprecated in PHP 5.3.0, and completely removed in PHP 5.4.0.

<h2 id="topic-11">How to view PHP settings with the phpinfo() function</h2>
This article describes how to use the <strong>phpinfo()</strong> function to view detailed information about the PHP environment, settings, and more.


To view <strong>phpinfo()</strong> output on our servers, you must have an A2 Hosting account. 
The information revealed by the <strong>phpinfo()</strong> function poses a potential security risk, so we do not post it publicly. 
Hackers and other malicious actors could use the information from <strong>phpinfo()</strong> to plan an attack.

<h4 id="topic-12">- View PHP settings with phpinfo Function</h4>
You often need to check PHP settings during web development. 
You can do this by running a script that calls the<strong> phpinfo()</strong> function. 
When you load the page in a web browser, the script shows all of the PHP configuration settings for your web site.

To use the <strong>phpinfo()</strong> function to view PHP settings:

Create a file that contains the following code:
&lt;?php
    phpinfo();
?&gt;Save the file as <em>info.php</em> or something similar.Upload the file to your <em>public_html</em> directory.Use your browser to go to http://<em>example.com</em>/info.php, where <em>example.com</em> represents your web site's domain name. 
The page displays a large amount of information about the PHP installation.

For security reasons, you should disable any calls to the <strong>phpinfo()</strong> function when web site development and testing is complete.
More Information

<h4 id="topic-17">- Setting up a custom php.ini file</h4>
A <em>php.ini</em> file contains directives for controlling many PHP settings. 
You can set up one or multiple custom <em>php.ini</em> files to define how your web site functions. 
For example, you might have a custom file in your <em>/home/username/public_html</em> directory for your web site's main pages, and a separate custom file in your <em>/home/username/public_html/images</em> directory for your web site's image files.

&nbsp;

To set up a custom <em>php.ini</em> file, follow these steps:

Log in to cPanel.
If you do not know how to log in to your cPanel account, please see <a href="/kb/cpanel/getting-started-with-cpanel/accessing-cpanel">this article</a>.
Using the File Manager, navigate to the directory where you want to modify the behavior of php. 
By default, a custom php.ini affects only the directory where it is located.&nbsp;
Click the File button in the File Manager toolbar to create a new file and name it php.ini.
Click on the new file and then click the Edit button in the File Manager toolbar to edit the new php.ini.
Add php directives to the new php.ini and then click the Save Changes button.
After you create the <em>php.ini</em> file and set its permissions, you can verify that the configuration is active. 
To do this, <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/view-php-settings">create a phpinfo file</a> in the directory where you created the php.ini
Load the phpinfo file in your web browser, and locate one of the directives you set. 
Make sure the changes are shown.
You can create custom <em>php.ini</em> files for each directory in your web site, but many people configure settings in one <em>php.ini</em> file and then apply it to the entire web site. 
To do this, add the following line to the <em>.htaccess</em> file in your web site's document root directory. 
Replace <em><span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span></em> with your A2 Hosting username:
lsapi_phpini /home/<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>username</em></span>/public_html/php.ini

<h4 id="topic-20">- Setting up a custom .htaccess file</h4>
You can use directives in an <em>.htaccess</em> file to control many PHP settings. 
Additionally, you can set up one or multiple custom <em>.htaccess</em> files to define how your web site functions. 
For example, you might have a custom file in your<em> public_html</em> directory for your web site's main pages, and a separate custom file in your <em>public_html/images</em> directory for your web site's image files.

To set up a custom <em>.htaccess</em> file, follow these steps:

Log in to your A2 Hosting account <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/accessing-your-account/using-ssh-secure-shell">using SSH</a>.
Use a text editor to create an <em>.htaccess</em> file in your web site's document root directory.

Alternatively, if you want to set PHP settings for a specific subdirectory, create the <em>.htaccess</em> file in that subdirectory.

For security reasons, the <em>.htaccess</em> file contents should not be visible to the public. 
To do this, add the following lines to the <em>.htaccess</em> file:
# Prevent Apache from serving .ht* files:
&lt;FilesMatch "^\.ht"&gt;
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;Save the changes and exit the text editor. 
You are now ready to add specific PHP directives to the <em>.htaccess</em> file.

<h4 id="topic-23">- Running PHP scripts from cron jobs</h4>
A common method for running PHP scripts from a cron job is to use a command-line program such as <strong>curl</strong> or <strong>wget</strong>. 
For example, the cron job runs a command similar to the following command:

curl http://example.com/script.php
In this command, <strong>curl</strong> retrieves the web page, which then runs the PHP script.

However, there is a better way to run PHP scripts on your web site from cron jobs. 
You can run the script directly by using the PHP command-line interpreter. 
This method is just as effective, and usually faster. 
The following command shows how to run a script using the PHP command-line interpreter:

php -q /home/<span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span>/public_html/script.php
In this example, the PHP command-line interpreter runs the script.php file. 
The <strong>-q</strong> option enables quiet mode, which prevents HTTP headers from being displayed.

Depending on the code in your PHP script, it may only run correctly when called from a specific directory. 
For example, if the script uses relative paths to include files, it will only run if it is called from the correct directory. 
The following command shows how to call a PHP script from a specific directory:

cd /home/<span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span>/public_html/; php -q script.php

If your script requires special configuration options, you can use a custom php.ini file. 
The <strong>-c</strong> option allows you to call a PHP script using a custom php.ini file:

php -c /home/<span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span>/php.ini /home/<span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span>/public_html/script.php

<h2 id="topic-24">Using PHP to send e-mail messages</h2>
This article discusses several methods for sending e-mail messages from PHP scripts.

You cannot use external SMTP servers to send e-mail messages if you have one of the following hosting packages:
Web hosting (Lite, Swift, or Turbo)Reseller hosting
For these hosting packages, you must use A2 Hosting servers. 
Other hosting packages have fewer restrictions, and can use some external SMTP servers to send e-mail messages.

<h4 id="topic-25">- Method #1: Using the PHP&nbsp;mail() function</h4>
The easiest way to send an e-mail message in a PHP script is to use the built-in PHP&nbsp;<strong>mail()</strong> function. 
The PHP&nbsp;<strong>mail()</strong> function has several required parameters:

Message recipient
Message subject
Message body
Additionally, there are two optional parameters that you should use to set the “From” e-mail address. 
It is important to set the “From” address correctly so replies, bounce notifications, and other messages return to the appropriate address. 
If the “From” address is not set, messages sent from your web site display a return address of <em><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d8b6b7bab7bca198bda0b9b5a8b4bdf6bbb7b5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>, where <em>example.com</em> represents the A2 Hosting server where your web site is hosted.

The following sample code demonstrates how to send an e-mail message with the “From” address set correctly. 
It also demonstrates how to set the <strong>Content-Type</strong> header so international (Unicode) characters are displayed correctly. 
In your own code, replace <em><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="85f7e0e6ecf5ece0ebf1c5e0fde4e8f5e9e0abe6eae8">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em> with the intended message recipient, and <em><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c1b2a4afa5a4b381a4b9a0acb1ada4efa2aeac">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em> with the return e-mail address:

&lt;?php
    mail("<em><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c1b3a4a2a8b1a8a4afb581a4b9a0acb1ada4efa2aeac">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>",
        "This is the message subject",
        "This is the message body",
        "From: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e1d0b000a0b1c2e0b160f031e020b400d0103">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" . 
"\r\n" . 
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8",
        "-f<em><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2152444f454453614459404c514d440f424e4c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>");
?&gt;



Although the built-in PHP&nbsp;<strong>mail()</strong> function is easy to use, it has some limitations. 
For example, it does not support SMTP authentication. 
SMTP authentication enables you to set the envelope headers correctly, which can help prevent mail servers from marking your messages as spam. 
See the following methods for ways to send messages from PHP using SMTP authentication.
To view the official documentation for the PHP&nbsp;<strong>mail()</strong> function, please visit <a href="https://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php">http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php</a>.

<h4 id="topic-26">- Method #2: Using the PEAR Mail class</h4>
Although the PEAR <strong>Mail</strong> class requires more configuration than the PHP&nbsp;<strong>mail()</strong> function, it is also much more powerful. 
With the PEAR <strong>Mail</strong> class, you can send e-mail messages using SMTP authentication, and specify many other e-mail settings. 
To do this, follow these steps:

Install and configure the PEAR Mail package on your account. 
For information about how to do this, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/pear-packages">this article</a>.
Remember that after you install the PEAR Mail package using cPanel, you must configure the <strong>include_path</strong> setting in a custom php.ini file.

The following code snippet demonstrates one way to send an e-mail message using the PEAR <strong>Mail</strong> class. 
You will have to modify the settings for your own application, particularly the <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>server_name</em></span>, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>username</em></span>, and <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>password</em></span> SMTP authentication parameters:
&lt;?php
    require 'Mail.php';

    // Define basic e-mail parameters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $recipient = '<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="582a3d3b3128313d362c183d20393528343d763b3735">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $headers['From'] = '<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="91e2f4fff5f4e3d1f4e9f0fce1fdf4bff2fefc">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $headers['Reply-to'] = '<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="90e3f5fef4f5e2d0f5e8f1fde0fcf5bef3fffd">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>';
    $headers['To'] = '<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d1a3b4b2b8a1b8b4bfa591b4a9b0bca1bdb4ffb2bebc">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $headers['Subject'] = 'This is the message subject';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $headers['Date'] = date('r');
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $headers['Message-Id'] = '&lt;' . 
uniqid() . 
'@example.com&gt;';
    $headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $body = 'This is the message body';

    // Define SMTP authentication parameters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $smtp_params['host'] = '<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>server_name</em></span>';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $smtp_params['auth'] = true;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $smtp_params['username'] = '<span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>username</em></span>';
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $smtp_params['password'] = '<span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>password</em></span>';

    // Create a Mail class instance with the above parameters, and then send the message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $message = Mail::factory('smtp', $smtp_params);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $message-&gt;send($recipient, $headers, $body);
?&gt;



In the code example above, the <strong>Content-Type</strong> header is set so Unicode characters display correctly. 
You can change this header value to any other character set that you want.

<h2 id="topic-28">PHP Include Path File Guide</h2>
This article describes several methods for setting the include path in PHP. 
By using include paths, you can centralize code that your web site frequently uses. 
Additionally, some features, such as PEAR, require you to set the include path so PHP can locate the appropriate files.

You should create the include directory at the username directory level (that is, one level above the public_html directory). 
This ensures that sensitive files are not in the public_html directory, which anyone can access.

<h4 id="topic-29">- #1 PHP Include Path Method: Use a custom php.ini file</h4>
You can use a custom php.ini file to specify the include path. 
If you have not already set up a custom php.ini file, please read <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/custom-php.ini-files">this article</a> before you proceed.

To set the include path using a custom php.ini file:

Open the php.ini file in an editor. 
You can do this by logging into your account over SSH, or by using the cPanel File Manager.
Add the following line to the php.ini file. 
Replace <em>USERNAME</em> with your A2 Hosting username and replace <em>include_directory</em> with the include directory's name:
include_path = ".:/home/<em>USERNAME</em>/<em>include_directory</em>"Save the file. 
The include path is now set.

<h4 id="topic-30">- #2 PHP Include Path Method: Use the set_include_path() function</h4>
Instead of setting the include path globally in a configuration file, you can set the path directly in a script file. 
To do this, you use the <strong>set_include_path()</strong> function.


When you set the include path using this method, it is only effective for the duration of the script's execution. 
The include path that you specify does not affect any other running scripts.
The following sample code demonstrates how to set the include path using the <strong>set_include_path()</strong> function:

&lt;?php
    set_include_path(".:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php:/home/<em>USERNAME</em>/php");
?&gt;

<h4 id="topic-31">- #3 PHP Include Pah Method: Use the .htaccess file</h4>
A few of our VPS and dedicated servers use Apache modules instead of CGI binaries to run PHP. 
If your server uses an Apache module to run PHP, you can modify the .htaccess file in your web site's document root directory.

To set the include path using the .htaccess file:

Open the .htaccess file in an editor. 
You can do this by logging into your account over SSH, or by using the cPanel File Manager.
Add the following line to the .htaccess file. 
Replace <em>path</em> with the include directory's path:
php_value include_path ".:/<em>path</em>"Save the file. 
The include path is now set.

Before you try to install a PEAR package, make sure it is not already installed. 
For example, our shared hosting servers already have several PEAR packages that are pre-installed systemwide. 
To see which PEAR packages are currently available for your web account, log in using SSH and then type the following command:

pear list
If the PEAR package that you want is not listed, then you can install it using one of the following methods.


A2 Hosting does not support installation of PECL (<span class="st">PHP Extension Community Library</span>) modules in our shared hosting environment.

<h4 id="topic-34">- <a name="sectionConfigIncludePath"></a>Configure the PHP include path</h4>
After you install a PEAR package for the first time using one of the methods above, you must configure the PHP include path. 
Otherwise, your PHP script files will be unable to locate the PEAR packages that you installed. 
After you configure the PHP include path, you do not need to do so again for subsequent PEAR package installations.


If you are using pre-installed systemwide PEAR packages in your code, you do not need to follow this procedure. 
This procedure only applies to PEAR packages that you have installed yourself.
To configure the PHP include path:

If you do not already have a custom php.ini file in the directory where your script file is located, set one up now. 
For information about how to set up a custom php.ini, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/custom-php.ini-files">this article</a>.
Open the php.ini file and locate the line that starts with:

<h4 id="topic-36">- Determine if a PHP function is available</h4>
You can determine whether or not a PHP function is enabled for your web site by using the <strong>function_exists()</strong> function.

To determine if a function is available:

Create a file that contains the following code. 
This sample code checks to see if the <strong>fsockopen()</strong> function is available. 
To check for another function, change the <strong>$function_name</strong> variable's value:
&lt;?php
    $function_name = "fsockopen";
    if ( function_exists($function_name<span style="display: none;"> </span>) ) {
        echo "$function_name<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span> is enabled";

    else {
        echo "$function_name<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span> is not enabled";
    }
?&gt;
Save the file as <em>function.php</em> or something similar.Upload the file to your <em>public_html</em> directory.Use your browser to go to http://<em>example.com</em>/function.php, where <em>example.com</em> represents your web site's domain name. 
The page displays whether or not the function is enabled for your web site.

<h4 id="topic-38">- HTTP Error 500 Problem</h4>
Visitors to your web site receive “500 Internal Server Error” messages when they access a page that uses PHP.

<h4 id="topic-39">- HTTP Error 500 Resolution</h4>
Almost all of our servers run PHP as a CGI binary. 
One of the side effects of running PHP as a CGI binary is that internal server errors can occur if the permissions on files and directories are set incorrectly. 
Internal server errors can also occur if there are certain PHP directives defined in an .htaccess file.

If your web site is experiencing internal server errors, the first thing you should do is check the server logs. 
The server logs provide valuable information about which files are causing the errors, and potential causes. 
If you have a shared hosting account, you can <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/cpanel/cpanel-logging-features/error-log">view your web site's error logs in cPanel</a>. 
If you have a VPS or dedicated server, you can view your web site's log files directly at the following paths:

/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log
/usr/local/apache/logs/suphp_log
<h5 id="Set-correct-permissions">Set correct permissions</h5>
If permission settings are causing internal server errors, you may see entries in the server logs similar to any of the following lines:

SoftException in Application.cpp:357: UID of script "/home/<em>username</em>/public_html/.htaccess" is smaller than min_uid

SoftException in Application.cpp:146: Mismatch between target UID (511) and UID (510) of file "/home/<em>username</em>/public_html/index.php"

SoftException in Application.cpp:256: File "/home/<em>username</em>/public_html/index.php" is writeable by others
These errors are all caused by permission issues. 
The first two lines indicate that the file's owner or group is set incorrectly. 
For example, if the owner of a PHP file is the <strong>nobody</strong> or <strong>root</strong> account instead of your user account, visitors receive an internal server error when they try to view the page. 
If you have a shared hosting account, our Guru Crew can change the owners and groups for your files. 
If you need further assistance, please open a support ticket with our Guru Crew on the Customer Portal at <a href="https://my.a2hosting.com">https://my.a2hosting.com</a>.

The third line indicates that file permissions for the index.php file are too permissive. 
For example, if your web site has a directory or file whose permissions are set to 777 (full permissions), anyone can read, write, or execute it. 
Additionally, visitors receive an internal server error when they try to view the page. 
To resolve this problem, change the permissions to 755 for directories and 644 for files. 
For example, to set the correct permissions for all directories and files in the public_html directory, type the following commands:

cd public_html
find . 
-type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find . 
-type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

Do not change permissions on the public_html directory itself! Doing so may make your web site inaccessible.
<h5 id="Check-.htaccess-directives">Check .htaccess directives</h5>
Servers that run PHP as a CGI binary cannot use the <strong>php_flag</strong> or <strong>php_value</strong> directives in an .htaccess file. 
If directives in an .htaccess file are causing internal server errors, you will see entries in the server logs similar to the following line:

/home/<em>username</em>/public_html/.htaccess: Invalid command 'php_flag', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
To resolve this problem, you must place any PHP directives into a custom php.ini file on your account, and remove or comment out any PHP directives in the .htaccess file. 
For information about how to set up a custom php.ini file, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/custom-php.ini-files">this article</a>.

<h4 id="topic-44">- Using the Exif extension in PHP</h4>
A2 Hosting's shared servers include PHP support for processing Exif data. 
The Exif PHP extension enables you to work with metadata from images taken by digital devices. 
For example, one common use of PHP's Exif functions is to process photographs taken by a digital camera. 
Depending on the image file format, you can also retrieve embedded thumbnails of images.

To extract all of the Exif headers from an image file, use the <strong>exif_read_data()</strong> function. 
The following PHP code sample demonstrates how to do this for an image file named <em>photograph.jpg</em>:

$my_exif_data = exif_read_data( 'photograph.jpg' );
print_r( $my_exif_data );More Information

<h4 id="topic-46">- Reverting to the previous version</h4>
If you experience problems after a PHP upgrade, you can always revert to an earlier version. 
To do this, use the PHP version tool in cPanel. 
For more information about how to change the PHP version for your web site, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/article-archive/php-version">this article</a>.


You may receive deprecation errors when you view your web site after a PHP upgrade. 
This is because functions or features that your site uses have been removed in the newer version. 
You can either modify your web site's code to make it compliant with the new version, or you can revert PHP to the previous version.
<h4 id="topic-47">- Copying an updated version of php.ini</h4>
If you use a custom php.ini file, make sure you use the correct file for your PHP version. 
For example:

If you are using PHP 5.3, copy the php.ini file located at <strong>/usr/local/lib/php.ini</strong>. 
This is the default php.ini file.
If you are using PHP 5.2.17, copy the php.ini file located at <strong>/opt/php/php-5.2.17/lib/php.ini</strong>.
You can find additional PHP versions in the <strong>/opt/php</strong> directory.
To copy the updated php.ini file to your <strong>public_html</strong> directory, log in to your account using SSH and then use the <strong>cp</strong> command. 
For example, the following command copies the default php.ini file to a user's <strong>public_html</strong> directory. 
Replace <em>USERNAME</em> with your own account username:

cp /usr/local/lib/php.ini /home/USERNAME/public_html/php.ini
To make the php.ini settings apply to all subdirectories, add the following line to your .htaccess file. 
Replace <em>USERNAME</em> with your own account username:

SuPHP_ConfigPath /home/<em>USERNAME</em>/public_html/
If you are using custom settings, such as <strong>allow_url_fopen</strong> or <strong>register_globals</strong>, you must reconfigure these settings after you copy the updated php.ini file.
For more information about how to use custom php.ini files, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/custom-php.ini-files">this article</a>.

<h4 id="topic-48">- “500 Internal Server Error” messages after changing the PHP version</h4>
If you receive “500 Internal Server Error” messages after changing the PHP version on your web site, check the .htaccess file in your <strong>public_html</strong> directory. 
At the end of the .htaccess file you should see text similar to the following:

# Start A2 Switcher Block
# Do not remove or modify this block! Added by PHP Switcher from cPanel to use an alternate PHP version. 
Contact Support for details.
&lt;IfModule mod_suphp.c&gt;
&nbsp; AddHandler application/x-httpd-php-5.4.13 .php
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# End A2 Switcher Block

The <strong>AddHandler</strong> value determines the PHP version for your site. 
Make sure that the correct version is specified, and that the line formatting is correct. 
Depending on how the .htaccess file was previously configured, you may find that lines of text have been merged, which could cause problems.

You may also see <strong>php_flag</strong> values configured in the .htaccess file. 
Any <strong>php_flag</strong> values should now be configured directly in a custom php.ini file. 
For more information about how to use custom php.ini files, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/custom-php.ini-files">this article</a>.

<h4 id="topic-49">- Zend Optimizer and Zend Guard</h4>
In PHP 5.3, Zend Optimizer changed to Zend Guard Loader. 
If you already have a custom php.ini file that calls the old Zend Optimizer libraries, you may receive the following error message:

Fatal error: Incompatible file format: The encoded file has format major ID 2, whereas the Loader expects 4
To resolve this issue, you must invoke the correct Zend libraries for your PHP version:

For PHP 5.3, add the following line to your php.ini file:
zend_extension="/usr/local/Zend/lib/Guard-5.5.0/php-5.3.x/ZendGuardLoader.so"For PHP 5.2.17, add the following lines to your php.ini file:
zend_extension=/opt/php/build/ZendOptimizer-3.3.9-linux-glibc23-x86_64/data/5_2_x_comp/ZendOptimizer.so
zend_loader.enable=1

If you are receiving Ioncube loader errors, you may need to set your site to use PHP version 5.2.17. 
Copy over the php.ini file located at <strong>/opt/php/php-5.2.17/lib/php.ini</strong>, and then add the following line to the top of your php.ini file:

zend_extension="/usr/local/IonCube/ioncube_loader_lin_5.2.so"

To make the php.ini settings apply to all subdirectories, add the following line to your .htaccess file. 
Replace <em>USERNAME</em> with your own account username:

SuPHP_ConfigPath /home/<em>USERNAME</em>/public_html/
&nbsp;

<h4 id="topic-50">- Using cron with PHP version 5.2.17</h4>
If you experience problems using cron with PHP version 5.2.17, make sure you set the path to PHP to <strong>/opt/php/php-5.2.17/bin/php</strong>.

The libraries for PHP version 5.2.17 are located in the <strong>/opt/php/php-5.2.17/include/php</strong> directory.

<h4 id="topic-51">- Still not working?</h4>

<h4 id="topic-53">- Using a custom php.ini file for cPanel cron jobs</h4>
Different php.ini files, and therefore different settings, are used depending on how you run a PHP script. 
For example, scripts run from the command line, and scripts run from a cPanel cron job, run under different environments.

To specify the exact environment for a PHP script in a cPanel cron job, you can define the path to a custom php.ini file. 
To do this, use the <strong>-c</strong> option. 
For example, the following command runs the <em>script.php</em> file using the php.ini file located in the user's <em>config</em> directory:

php -c /home/username/config/php.ini /home/username/script.php
A common scenario where you need a custom php.ini file is when a script must access remote URLs. 
To do this, you must enable the <strong>allow_url_fopen</strong> directive.

<h2 id="topic-54">How To Use PHP Sessions</h2>
This article describes what PHP sessions are, and how to implement them in your PHP applications.

<a href="#Related-Articles">Related Articles</a>
<h4 id="topic-55">- About PHP sessions</h4>
HTTP is a stateless protocol. 
In other words, a web site does not maintain any information about a visitor from one page visit to the next. 
This is a problem if you want to keep track of individual visitors as they navigate through a web site. 
For example, a shopping cart or online banking application is a common scenario where this functionality is necessary.

PHP sessions work around the stateless limitations of HTTP, and enable you to store data associated with each visitor to your web site. 
With just a few lines of code, your web site can maintain data about visitors as they navigate your site.

<h4 id="topic-56">- PHP&nbsp;Session Start</h4>
When you start a session, the web server generates a session identifier that uniquely identifies the visitor. 
By default, session data is stored in the server's <em>/tmp</em> directory in files that are named <em>sess_ </em>followed by a unique alphanumeric string (the session identifier).

To start a session, use the PHP&nbsp;<strong>session_start()</strong> function. 
Because the PHP&nbsp;<strong>session_start()</strong> function sends information in the HTTP headers, though, you must call this function before the page generates any content. 
The following sample code demonstrates how to do this:

&lt;?php
    session_start();
?&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Test page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

By itself, the <strong>session_start()</strong> function doesn't add much functionality to a web page. 
You need to use PHP session variables to really tap into the potential of PHP sessions.

For more information about the <strong>session_start()</strong> function, please visit <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php</a>.

<h4 id="topic-57">- Working with PHP session variables</h4>
The <strong>$_SESSION</strong> associative array allows you to store session data in variables. 
For example, suppose you want to implement a very simple hit counter for a page. 
You can't do this with a generic HTML page. 
With PHP sessions, though, it's easy. 
The following code sample demonstrates one way to do this:

&lt;?php
    session_start();
    $_SESSION['hits']++;
?&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Simple page hit counter&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You have visited this page &lt;?php print $_SESSION['hits'] ?&gt; times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

In this example, we define a variable named <strong>hits</strong> that is stored in the <strong>$_SESSION</strong> array. 
Each time the page is loaded, the <strong>hits</strong> value increases by one.

It is easy to add additional PHP session variables to the <strong>$_SESSION</strong> array. 
All you have to do is reference the variable name you want to use, and PHP takes care of the rest, tracking its value across multiple HTTP connections.

For more information about the <strong>$_SESSION</strong> array, please visit <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.session.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.session.php</a>.

<h4 id="topic-58">- Ending a session</h4>
To end a session, use the <strong>session_destroy()</strong> function. 
This function deletes all server-side data for the current session.

For example, adding the <strong>session_destroy()</strong> function to our page counter sample code above wouldn't make much sense, because the value of the <strong>hits</strong> variable would be destroyed every time the page is loaded. 
(The page would always display “You have visited this page 1 times” no matter how many times you load it.)

On the other hand, suppose your site has a shopping cart application. 
A user adds products to the cart on one page, fills out the order information on another page, and finally checks out. 
After the user checks out and completes the purchase, you probably want to empty the cart and reset the PHP session variables. 
The <strong>session_destroy()</strong> function enables you to do this.

For more information about the <strong>session_destroy()</strong> function, please visit <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-destroy.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-destroy.php</a>.

<h4 id="topic-59">- Session settings in php.ini</h4>
There are numerous settings available in the <em>php.ini</em> file that enable you to configure how sessions function on your web site. 
For example, the <strong>session.cookie_lifetime</strong> setting enables you to control how long a session cookie remains valid, and the <strong>session.auto_start</strong> setting enables you to start sessions automatically instead of calling the <strong>session_start()</strong> function explicitly. 
Another important option is the <strong>session.save_path</strong> setting, which enables you to specify where PHP stores session files (by default, they are stored in the server's <em>/tmp</em> directory, but you may prefer to store them somewhere in your own directory instead).

For detailed information about all of the session settings available in the <em>php.ini</em> file, please visit <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php</a>.

<h4 id="topic-60">- Session security</h4>
There are several security considerations you should keep in mind when working with PHP sessions. 
For example, you must protect against possible session hijacking and fixation attacks.

<a href="#Using-the-internationalization-extension">Using the internationalization extension</a>
<a href="#More-Information">More Information</a>
<h4 id="topic-75">- Using the internationalization extension</h4>
A2 Hosting's shared servers include support for PHP's internationalization extension, which is named <em>intl</em>. 
This extension enables you to specify a locale for your PHP applications. 
A locale is simply is a collection of the following region-specific settings:

The alphabetical order used to sort text strings.
Character classification and conversion, such as between uppercase and lowercase letters.
Currency formatting.
Decimal separator.
Date and time formatting.
To view a list of locales available on your server, log in to your A2 Hosting account <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/accessing-your-account/using-ssh-secure-shell">using SSH</a>, and then type the following command:

locale -a
Most locales are in the format <em>xx_YY</em>, where <em>xx</em> is a two-letter designation for the language, and <em>YY</em> is a two-letter designation for a country or region. 
Some locales also have an additional identifier that indicates the character set. 
For example, <em>en_US</em> represents English in the United States, while <em>zh_TW.big5</em> represents Chinese in Taiwan using the Big5 character set.

The following code example demonstrates how to set locales using the <strong>setlocale()</strong> function. 
It uses an HTML table to display the current locale setting, as well as the date, time, and a number represented in the current locale:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;PHP intl example&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Encoding&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date/time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;?php

    // Set the locale to French in France:
    setlocale( LC_ALL, 'fr_FR' );
    printRow();

    // Set the locale to English in the United States:
    setlocale( LC_ALL, 'en_US' );
    printRow();

    // Set the locale to Russian in Russia:
    setlocale( LC_ALL, 'ru_RU' );
    printRow();

    // This function generates a table row that displays various text using the current locale setting:
    function printRow()
    {
        $number = 133.52;

        print "&lt;tr&gt;";
        print "&lt;td&gt;" . 
setlocale( LC_ALL, 0 ) . 
"&lt;/td&gt;";    // Calling setlocale() with locale '0' returns the current locale
        print "&lt;td&gt;" . 
strftime( '%c' ) . 
"&lt;/td&gt;";
        print "&lt;td&gt;" . 
$number . 
"&lt;/td&gt;";
        print "&lt;/tr&gt;";
    }
?&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

If you run this example, you see the date and time format displayed differently for each locale. 
Similarly, the <strong>$number</strong> variable is displayed differently: in French and Russian, the decimal separator is a comma (<em>133<strong>,</strong>52</em>), whereas in English it is a period (<em>133<strong>.</strong>52</em>).


Depending on the locale, you may also have to change the page's character encoding set to ensure that text displays correctly. 
In the example above, the Cyrillic characters may not display correctly when the locale is set to Russian. 
One way to fix this is to specify the character set directly in the HTTP header as follows:
&lt;?php
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; header('Content-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-5');
?&gt;

<h4 id="topic-77">- PHP&nbsp;Composer Install</h4>
To install Composer PHP, follow these steps:

Log in to your account <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/accessing-your-account/using-ssh-secure-shell">using SSH</a>.
To configure your shell environment to use PHP Composer, type the following commands. 
Replace <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>username</em></span> with your account username:
echo 'alias composer="php -d allow_url_fopen=On /home/<em><span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span></em>/composer.phar"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
You can use composer with alternate PHP versions as well:
On an account that has CageFS enabled, all you need to do is select the PHP version in cPanel that you want to use. 
For information about how to do this, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/cpanel/cpanel-software/changing-php-versions-and-settings-in-cpanel">this article</a>.
On an account that does <strong>not</strong> have CageFS enabled, you must manually specify the path to the PHP executable in the <em>~/.bashrc</em> file. 
For example, if you want to run composer using PHP 5.5, type the following commands instead:
echo 'alias php="/opt/php/php-5.5.0/bin/php"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'alias composer="/opt/php/php-5.5.0/bin/php -d allow_url_fopen=On /home/<em><span style="color:#FF0000;">username</span></em>/composer.phar"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
 For more information about how to use alternate PHP versions on A2 Hosting servers that do not use CageFS, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/article-archive/using-alternate-php-versions">this article</a>.

</ul>To download the PHP Composer installer, type the following commands:
cd ~
curl -k -O https://getcomposer.org/installer
To install Composer PHP, type the following command:
php -d allow_url_fopen=On installer

To confirm composer installed correctly, type the following command:
composer -V
 Composer should display the version number. 
If it does not, repeat steps 2 to 4, paying close attention to the paths.

To update the composer installation to the newest version in the future, type the following command:
composer self-update</ul>

<h2 id="topic-78">How to determine if APC is installed on a server</h2>
This article describes how to determine if the Alternative PHP Cache (APC) is currently installed on your server.


APC is supported on the following hosting packages:
Turbo Web Hosting
VPS (managed, unmanaged, and Cloud VPS)
Flex Dedicated server (managed and unmanaged)

Table of Contents

<a href="#More-Information">More Information</a>
<a href="#Related-Articles">Related Articles</a>
<h4 id="topic-79">- About APC</h4>
The Alternative PHP Cache (APC) is a PHP extension that provides <em>opcode caching</em>. 
By caching the compiled operation codes (opcodes) of PHP scripts, APC enables sites to serve page content significantly faster. 
APC runs on PHP 5.4 and earlier versions.

Because APC is a separate extension, it may or may not already be installed on your server. 
The following procedure explains how to determine if your server has the APC extension installed.


For PHP 5.5 and later versions, <strong>OPcache</strong> replaces APC. 
OPcache is a core PHP component that does not require the installation of a separate extension.
<h4 id="topic-80">- Determining if APC is installed</h4>
To determine if the APC extension is installed on your server, follow these steps:

Create a file that contains the following PHP code:
&lt;?php
    phpinfo();
?&gt;Save the file as <em>info.php</em>.Upload the file to the <em>public_html</em> directory on your hosting account.Use your browser to go to <em>http://<span style="color:#FF0000;">example.com</span>/info.php</em>, where <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>example.com</em></span> represents your web site's domain name. 
The page displays a large amount of information about the server's PHP installation.Use your browser to search for the term <span class="user-input">apc</span>. 
If APC is installed, you see a section that resembles the following:
<img alt="PHP - APC" src="/images/uploads/knowledgebase_images/kb-php-config-apc.png" style="width: 530px; height: 336px;">


If you do not see this section, then APC is not installed. 
If you have a managed VPS or managed Flex Dedicated server, please open a support ticket on the Customer Portal at <a href="https://my.a2hosting.com">https://my.a2hosting.com</a>, and we will install and configure it for you. 
If you have an&nbsp;unmanaged server, you can install the APC extension yourself.

For security reasons, you should remove the <em>info.php</em> file after you are done testing.

<h2 id="topic-81">Using the MailChimp API with PHP</h2>
This article discusses how to use the MailChimp API (application programming interface) with PHP.

This article assumes that you have already signed up for and configured a MailChimp account. 
For information about how to do this, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/add-on-services/signing-up-for-a-mailchimp-account">this article</a>.

<a href="#Using-the-official-API-wrapper">Using the official API wrapper</a>
<a href="#More-Information">More Information</a>
<a href="#Related-Articles">Related Articles</a>
<h4 id="topic-82">- About the MailChimp API</h4>
The MailChimp API (application programming interface) provides a way to work with campaigns and lists programmatically. 
This article demonstrates various ways to use the API with PHP.

<h4 id="topic-83">- Using the official API wrapper</h4>
To access your MailChimp account using PHP, you use code that provides a “wrapper” to the API. 
There are several unofficial API wrappers for MailChimp that use a simplified interface. 
The procedure below, however, demonstrates how to use the official MailChimp API wrapper.

To do this, follow these steps:

Log in to your A2 Hosting account <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/accessing-your-account/using-ssh-secure-shell">using SSH</a>.
At the command prompt, type the following commands:
cd ~
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mailchimp-api-php.git
 After the <em>git clone</em> command completes, there is a new <em>mailchimp-api-php</em> directory.

Type the following command:
cp -R mailchimp-api-php/src mailchimp

This command copies the API source code to the separate <em>mailchimp</em> directory (you can actually use any directory name you want). 
Doing so enables you to pull future updates in the <em>mailchimp-api-php</em> directory for further testing, without overwriting source code referenced directly by your applications.To use the MailChimp API in your PHP code, you must include the <em>Mailchimp.php</em> file. 
Then you can create a <strong>Mailchimp</strong> object and work with the API. 
For example, the following code sample demonstrates how to add a new subscriber to an existing list:
&lt;?php

require('mailchimp/Mailchimp.php');    // You may have to modify the path based on your own configuration.

$api_key = "<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>Add your Mailchimp API key here</em></span>";
$list_id = "<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>Add your list ID here</em></span>";

$Mailchimp = new Mailchimp( $api_key );
$Mailchimp_Lists = new Mailchimp_Lists( $Mailchimp );

try 
{
    $subscriber = $Mailchimp_Lists-&gt;subscribe(
        $list_id,
        array('email' =&gt; '<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="670c020b0b1e0c080227021f060a170b024904080a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></span>'),      // Specify the e-mail address you want to add to the list.
        array('FNAME' =&gt; '<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>Kelly</em></span>', 'LNAME' =&gt; '<em><span style="color:#FF0000;">Koe</span></em>'),   // Set the first name and last name for the new subscriber.
        '<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>text</em></span>',    // Specify the e-mail message type: 'html' or 'text'
        <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>FALSE</em></span>,     // Set double opt-in: If this is set to TRUE, the user receives a message to confirm they want to be added to the list.
        <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>TRUE</em></span>       // Set update_existing: If this is set to TRUE, existing subscribers are updated in the list. 
If this is set to FALSE, trying to add an existing subscriber causes an error.
    );
} 
catch (Exception $e) 
{
    echo "Caught exception: " . 
$e;
}

if ( ! empty($subscriber['leid']) )
{
    echo "Subscriber added successfully.";
}
else
{
    echo "Subscriber add attempt failed.";
}

?&gt;

<h2 id="topic-84">'Allowed memory size exhausted' error message in PHP</h2>
This article describes how to resolve a problem that may occur when you run a PHP-based web application, such as WordPress or Drupal.

<h4 id="topic-85">- Problem</h4>
When you try to view a PHP-enabled page, you receive an error message that resembles the following (the exact values and paths vary):

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted
(tried to allocate 33554432 bytes) in /home/example/public_html/filename.php on line 1622

<h4 id="topic-86">- Cause</h4>
This problem occurs when an application uses more memory than PHP allows.

<h4 id="topic-87">- Resolution</h4>
If you develop a site using your own PHP code, you can try to make your code more memory-efficient. 
For example, you can use the <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php"><strong>unset()</strong> function</a> to destroy variables and objects that you no longer need, thereby freeing up memory.

However, if you are running a third-party web application, such as WordPress or Joomla, it is highly inadvisable to modify the code directly. 
In such scenarios, you may need to increase the PHP script memory limit. 
The method to do this depends on the type of hosting account you have.

To determine which of the following methods applies to your account, please see <a href="/kb/developer-corner/php/changing-php-settings-and-versions">this article</a>.
If your account uses <em>php.ini</em> files to change PHP settings, for information about how to change the script memory limit, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/using-php.ini-directives/php-script-memory-limit">this article</a>.
If your account uses <em>.htaccess</em> files to change PHP settings, for information about how to change the script memory limit, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/using-php-directives-in-custom-htaccess-files/setting-the-php-script-memory-limit-in-an-htaccess-file">this article</a>.
If your account uses CageFS, follow these steps:
Log in to cPanel.
If you do not know how to log in to your cPanel account, please see <a href="/kb/cpanel/getting-started-with-cpanel/accessing-cpanel">this article</a>.
In the <span class="UI">Software/Services</span> section of the cPanel home screen, click <span class="UI">Select PHP Version</span>:
<img alt="cPanel - Select PHPVersion icon" src="/images/uploads/knowledgebase_images/kb-turbo-php-version-icon.png" style="width: 503px; height: 176px;">

Click <span class="UI">Switch to PHP Settings</span>.Locate the <span class="UI">memory_limit</span> row, select the new value for the script memory limit, and then click <span class="button">Apply</span>.Click <span class="button">Save</span> to save the settings. 
The new PHP setting takes effect immediately.

<h2 id="topic-88">How to use ionCube Loader with different PHP versions</h2>
This article describes how to use ionCube Loader with different PHP versions. 
The ionCube Loader is a PHP extension that decodes and executes encoded PHP script files at run-time.

The steps and procedures to use in this article depend on whether or not your hosting account uses CageFS. 
To determine if CageFS is enabled for your account, please see <a href="/kb/developer-corner/determining-if-your-account-uses-cagefs">this article</a>.

<a href="#Related-Articles">Related Articles</a>
<h4 id="topic-89">- Using ionCube on CageFS servers</h4>
If your account is on a server that has CageFS enabled, ionCube is already loaded for the default PHP version (currently PHP 5.5). 
When you change the active PHP version for your account, the corresponding ionCube loader is automatically configured as well. 
You do not have to do any special steps to use ionCube with different PHP versions on your account.

<h4 id="topic-90">- Using ionCube on non-CageFS servers</h4>
If your account is on a server that does <strong>not</strong> have CageFS enabled, ionCube is already loaded for the default PHP version (currently 5.3.29). 
However, if you use a different PHP version, you must manually download and install the appropriate ionCube Loader.

Using alternate PHP versions with ionCube Loader should work, but please note that we do not provide support for these configurations.
To do this, follow these steps:

Use your web browser to go to <a href="http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php">http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php</a>.
Download the <span class="UI">zip</span> file for the <span class="UI">stable</span> release of the <span class="UI">Linux (64 bits)</span> platform to your local computer.
Using <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/accessing-your-account/using-ftp-file-transfer-protocol">FTP</a> or the <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/cpanel/cpanel-file-features/cpanel-file-manager/upload-and-download-files">cPanel File Manager</a>, upload the zip file to the home directory of your A2 Hosting account.
Using the command line or the cPanel File Manager, extract the contents of the zip file. 
After the file is unzipped, there should be an <em>ioncube</em> directory that contains several files.
If you have not already done so, create a <em>php.ini</em> file in your <em>public_html</em> directory.

For information about how to set up a custom <em>php.ini</em> file, please see <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/custom-php.ini-files">this article</a>.

Add the following line to the <em>php.ini</em> file. 
Replace <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>username</em></span> with your A2 Hosting account username, and replace <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>X.Y</em></span> with the PHP version you are using:
zend_extension="/home/<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>username</em></span>/ioncube/ioncube_loader_lin_<span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>X.Y</em></span>.so"

For example, if your username is <em>example</em>, and you are running PHP 5.5, you would type the following:

zend_extension="/home/example/ioncube/ioncube_loader_lin_5.5.so"
Save your changes to the <em>php.ini</em> file. 
The new configuration is now active.
To verify the new configuration, you can create a PHP file that <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/view-php-settings">runs the phpinfo() function</a>. 
Load the file in your web browser, and then search for the text <em>ionCube Loader</em>. 
It should appear in the <span class="UI">Additional Modules</span> section.

<h4 id="topic-95">- Install&nbsp;PHPMailer with Composer</h4>
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that you can use to install packages required by a PHP project.

To install PHPMailer using Composer, follow these steps:

Log in to your account using SSH.
Change the directory to where you want to use the PHPMailer project. 
The location can be the document root of a domain as shown, or a subdirectory:
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="097c7a6c7b497a6c7b7f6c7b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> [~] cd public_htmlTo install PHPMailer, type the following command:
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6b1e180e192b180e191d0e19">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> [~/public_html] composer require phpmailer/phpmailer

Composer suggests other packages to install, but they are not needed for this example.

<h5 id="Testing-the-PHPMailer-installation">Testing the PHPMailer installation</h5>
To test the installation, follow these steps:

Create a PHP file to test the installation. 
You can create the file with the editor of your choice. 
In this procedure we use vi, but you can also use other command line editors or the graphical editor in your control panel. 
The file is named <em>mailer.php</em> in this example, but it can be any name ending in <em>.php</em>.
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="057076607745766077736077">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> [~/public_html] vi mailer.phpType (or paste) the following code into the editor. 
Replace the items in red with the actual values for your account and save the file:
&lt;?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$mail = new PHPMailer();
$mail-&gt;isSMTP();
