<h2 id="Is-EasyEDA-safe"><a href="#Is-EasyEDA-safe" class="headerlink" title="Is EasyEDA safe?"></a>Is EasyEDA safe?</h2><p>There are no absolutely secure things in the world but even if you have the misfortune - as happened to one of our team - of losing one laptop and having two hard drives break,<br>EasyEDA will try to protect your designs in following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We utilize SSL throughout the entire domain EasyEDA.com. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology encrypts all data transferred between your computer and our servers. Your data is for your eyes only.</li>
<li>You can save your files locally.</li>
<li>Multiple copies of every file are saved in your local database. </li>
<li>EasyEDA servers backup your designs frequently.</li>

We promise that if we cannot make enough money out of EasyEDA to keep it alive or to fund further development, we will not simply abandon our baby or our community but we will consider donating the code to the Open Source Community to let them build on our efforts. There are no companies who can stay forever, so if a time comes when we have to close down,  we will follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give our users six months warning prior to closure;</li>
<li>Ensure all our users can backup their designs;</li>
<li>Ensure that user's designs can be exported to some other EDA tools, such as Kicad, Altium Designer and others.</li>
<li>Package our codes, so that users can install an EasyEDA in their own OS (Windows, Linux, Mac). Users can then build their own cloud EDA.</li>
<li>Upload our codes to github.com and make them open source.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, nothing will be lost and our users can continue to enjoy an awesome web based EDA tool that lets them stay in charge of their designs: anywhere, anytime and on any OS.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-add-solder-mask-aperture"><a href="#How-to-add-solder-mask-aperture" class="headerlink" title="How to add solder mask aperture."></a>How to add solder mask aperture.</h2><p>It is possible to get boards with the copper exposed so that you can apply a layer of solder over those tracks to further increase their current carrying capacity. In this case, you need to add solder mask over a copper (copper area, track, solid region).<br>EasyEDA will add solder mask for pads automatically. Sometimes however, you may need to add an aperture in the solder mask to expose and area of copper.  </p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, add a top or bottom solder mask layer, as required.<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/254_FAQ_SolderMask.png" alt="">   </p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, draw a region in the solder mask layer over a copper item as illustrated in the image below. This in effect draws an aperture in the solder mask so that the copper item inside the region, in this case the track, will be not be covered by the green film of solder mask.<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/255_FAQ_SolderMask_1.png" alt="">    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A common mistake is to just draw a solder mask, without a copper area, like the track pointed to by the yellow arrow. That is incorrect and does not produce the desired result.</p>
<p>Or you can click the track, and then click the <code>Expose Copper</code> button at the right-hand panel.</p>

<li><p>Manually creating backup schematics into the same project. When a project is converted to PCB, EasyEDA will merge all of the schematics under the same project into a single PCB. If there are multiple copies of the same schematic in a project then this will create errors such as duplicate part prefixes. Especially if you are new to EasyEDA, just keep one copy of each unique schematic in any one project. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Saving schematic and PCB into different projects. Unless you are absolutely sure that you will not need to update (Synchronise) your PCB from changes made to your schematic then please keep the schematics and PCB under the same project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bad packages. Schematic symbols must have the appropriate footprints assigned to them, these footprints must exist in the library, and for any footprint that you have not created yourself, you must have clicked on the <strong>Favorite</strong> option in the component search window to add it to your <strong>Favorite Parts</strong> list in the left hand Navigation panel.<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/258_FAQ_AddFavorite.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="Essential-Check"><a href="#Essential-Check" class="headerlink" title="Essential Check"></a>Essential Check</h2><h2 id="Essential-Check-Introduction"><a href="#Essential-Check-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Essential Check Introduction"></a>Essential Check Introduction</h2><p>By following - and constantly checking against - a set of procedures, it is possible to avoid just about all of the common mistakes and omissions that can significantly delay or even stop a schematic being successfully converted to a PCB and then that PCB being successfully updated from the schematic as a design progresses.</p>
<p>It can also significantly reduce the likelihood of a PCB being made that subsequently is found to not work correctly due to mistakes made during the creation of the original schematic (Schematic Capture). </p>
<p>After spending hours on Schematic Capture, it is very frustrating to be presented with error messages about prefix conflicts, missing or invalid packages when first attempting to pass a schematic through to the PCB Editor by clicking on the <strong>Convert Project to PCB…</strong> button or, after making changes to a schematic, similar error messages or having components that disappear from the PCB when attempting to update an existing PCB using the <strong>Update PCB…</strong> button in the Schematic Editor or the <strong>Import Changes…</strong> button in the PCB Editor. </p>
<p>These issues can be avoided by running through a series of checks for the first time each new Part (i.e. the first instance) is placed into the schematic.</p>
<p>There are several other issues that arise from mistakes in and omissions from the schematic that people encounter only after they are part way through a PCB design or - worse still - only when they receive their PCBs in the post.</p>
<p>Almost all of these other issues can be avoided by running through a further series of checks (i) during Schematic Capture, (ii) once Schematic Capture is complete but before first attempting to convert the schematic into a PCB and (iii) when updating the PCB as work progresses.</p>
<p>This document pulls together all the essential procedures to follow and things to check in the schematic before clicking on the <strong>Convert Project to PCB…</strong>, <strong>Update PCB…</strong> or <strong>Import Changes…</strong> buttons.</p>
<h2 id="Things-to-understand-before-using-this-document"><a href="#Things-to-understand-before-using-this-document" class="headerlink" title="Things to understand before using this document."></a>Things to understand before using this document.</h2><p>Before using the document it is important that the following points are clearly understood:</p>
<h3 id="What-constitutes-a-Part-in-a-schematic-and-a-PCB"><a href="#What-constitutes-a-Part-in-a-schematic-and-a-PCB" class="headerlink" title="What constitutes a Part in a schematic and a PCB?"></a>What constitutes a Part in a schematic and a PCB?</h3><p>A Part is any element of the circuit that is to be mounted on the PCB plus any element which is ultimately intended to be mounted on or form an integral part of the PCB such as heat sinks, PCB mounting holes, mounting holes for PCB mounted potentiometers and switches (for example where a PCB is used as a front panel or as a self-contained test jig), test points, wire links or jumpers, fuse holders and even image based elements such as high voltage warnings and logos.</p>
<p>Note that fuses that are fitted into PCB mounted fuse holders are best dealt with in a schematic by showing the fuse using a fuse symbol in the schematic but assigning to that fuse symbol the BoM information - including the package - that is for the required fuse holder. The required fuse ratings, type and supplier information can then be included in the BoM using Add new parameter function.</p>
<p>Other socketed devices can be treated in the same way.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-relationship-between-Parts-Schematic-Symbols-and-PCB-Packages"><a href="#What-is-the-relationship-between-Parts-Schematic-Symbols-and-PCB-Packages" class="headerlink" title="What is the relationship between Parts, Schematic Symbols and PCB Packages?"></a>What is the relationship between Parts, Schematic Symbols and PCB Packages?</h3><p>Any Part must have a Schematic Symbol to represent it in the schematic (a.k.a. Schematic Lib) and that Schematic Symbol must have a PCB Package (a.k.a. PCB Lib) assigned to it either when the symbol is created or after placing the first instance of it into the schematic. </p>
<p>The associated PCB Package must exist in the library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that every Part has a Schematic Symbol with a PCB Package associated with it <strong>and</strong> that that PCB Package actually exists in the Parts (SHIFT+F) library will avoid a <strong>Missing package</strong> error being issued on Conversion or Update to PCB.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that a component may comprise more than one device in a package, for example logic gates. Some symbols represent both devices in a single symbol but quite often a separate symbol is used to represent each of the devices. This may mean that some of the pin numbers and/or names on the symbols representing each of the two devices may be different although both may have the same power and ground pin numbers and/or names.</p>
<p>High pin count devices such as processors and FPGAs may be split into several symbols representing different sections or ports. It is important to ensure that pin numbers and names are unique across all the symbols.</p>
<p>It is possible that a component may be available in different packages. For example the LM358-N dual operational amplifier is available in several different packages. The pin numbering and/or naming of the symbol may be different depending on which package the component is supplied in.</p>
<p>It is easy in EasyEDA to change the pin numbering and/or naming for a Schematic Symbol (using the <code>I</code> Hotkey) or a PCB Package so it may be tempting to think of an LM358-N as the same part in a different package and just put down a symbol, edit the package assigned to it and then hack the pin numbers and names about until they match the PCB package.</p>
<p>However, an LM358-N in a SOIC-8 package has a different pinout, a different part number and has to be physically ordered as a different part from an LM358-N in a DSBGA-8 package.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are therefore two <em>different</em>  Parts. </li>
</ul>
<p>When thought of like this it should be clear that there should be one Schematic Symbol (or pair if each device has a separate symbol) and a matching PCB Package for an LM358-N in a SOIC-8 package and another Schematic Symbol (or pair if each device has a separate symbol) and a matching PCB Package for an LM358-N in a DSBGA-8 package.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the pin numbers/names of the Schematic Symbol for a Part are correct, unique and match those of the PCB package associated <em>with that particular part</em> will avoid the generation of the <strong>Invalid package</strong> error being issued on Conversion or Update to PCB.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Why-do-Parts-in-a-PCB-disappear-when-the-PCB-is-updated-from-the-schematic"><a href="#Why-do-Parts-in-a-PCB-disappear-when-the-PCB-is-updated-from-the-schematic" class="headerlink" title="Why do Parts in a PCB disappear when the PCB is updated from the schematic?"></a>Why do Parts in a PCB disappear when the PCB is updated from the schematic?</h3><p>It is important to understand that any Part that is supposed to form part of or be mounted on the PCB must have a corresponding Schematic Symbol in the schematic. </p>
<p>If it <em>does</em> then as soon as the PCB is created, the PCB Package for that Part , even such a seemingly abstract item as a mounting hole, warning sign or a logo, will be pulled into the PCB layout without having to be added to the PCB later by hand.</p>
<p>If it <em>does not</em> then not only will the PCB package for that Part not be pulled into the PCB layout as it is created but when it is added to the PCB later by hand and the PCB is then updated to bring in changes made to the original schematic, <em>that PCB package will be deleted</em>.</p>
<p>Such elements can be added to the schematic later and then imported into the PCB but if they do not exist in the schematic at the time the PCB is updated from that schematic then they will always be deleted and will therefore have to be added back to the PCB by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries (or SHIFT+F) &gt; Search for and select the part then &gt; More &gt; Add Favorite/Clone</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/258_FAQ_AddFavorite.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to do this will result in the package not being found and a <strong>Missing package</strong> error being issued on Conversion or Update to PCB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Packages in the other library sections will be found automatically.</p>
<p>Note however that although Schematic Symbols and PCB packages created by a user within a Team will automatically appear in that user's My Parts library, once that user swaps to another Team, those parts will no longer appear in their My Parts library but will only be available via the <strong>Add Favorite</strong> option from the User Contributions library.</p>
<h2 id="Procedures-and-Checklist"><a href="#Procedures-and-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Procedures and Checklist"></a>Procedures and Checklist</h2><ul>
<li>Verify that the Schematic has been drawn to show clearly how the components in the circuit are connected together;  </li>
</ul>
<p>The schematic must help the reader understand signal and power flow in the circuit with inputs on the left, outputs on the right, positive supplies at the top, negative supplies at the bottom and netlabels used to clarify connections and reduce congestion. </p>
<p>Components may be grouped by function and boxes may be drawn around them. </p>
<p>Decoupling components may be drawn adjacent to the devices they are associated with or symbols with dedicated sub-parts for power pins can be used to reduce congestion;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Design Manager (left-click the <strong>Design Manager</strong> button in the left hand panel) to check that all components are present in the schematic and that all nets have been assigned reasonable mnemonic names and have at least two connection. </li>
</ul>
<p>Naming nets instead of relying on the EasyEDA auto-generated alphanumeric names makes signal tracing and debugging the final PCB much easier but care must be taken to ensure that names are correct and that there are no unintended duplicate names or accidental increments in numbered nets;</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that there are no duplicate prefixes in the schematic:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://easyeda.com/forum/topic/How_to_resolve_quotPrefix_Conflictquot_error_-gpbca8642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://easyeda.com/forum/topic/How_to_resolve_quotPrefix_Conflictquot<em>error</em>-gpbca8642</a></p>
<p>Remember to check across all sheets of a multi-sheet schematic;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check that the schematic is drawn correctly.<br>In particular, check that no nets have been accidentally cross connected, that wires have join dots where they are intended to be joined, that they are properly connected to component pins and that nets joined by netlabels are correctly named and that there are no unintended duplicate net names.<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/286_PCBOrder_EssentialCheck_2.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify that junctions of 4 or more wires are drawn to show staggered junctions to avoid confusion with wires that cross but are not joined at the crossing point.<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/286_PCBOrder_EssentialCheck_3.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Check that all parts and nets have been placed with the Canvas Attribute <strong>Snap = Yes</strong>:<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/286_PCBOrder_EssentialCheck_4.png" alt=""><br>and that no parts have been placed off grid so that although they may appear to be connected on close inspection it can be seen that they are not:<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/286_PCBOrder_EssentialCheck_5.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Check that pins have been terminated (pulled up, down, left open etc.) as specified in manufacturers'  datasheets. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Check that all unconnected pins have <strong>No Connect</strong> symbols attached directly to them. Unconnected pins without No Connect symbols attached directly to them will show up as alphanumeric net names in the Design Manager but will not highlight when clicked on in the Design Manager.<br>No Connect symbols must be attached directly to component pins. There should be no wire between the No Connect symbol and the pin.<br><img src="https://image.easyeda.com/images/286_PCBOrder_EssentialCheck_6.png" alt=""><br>Note that the No Connect symbol changed in V4.8.5 of EasyEDA from a red cross to a green one to make the highlighted state of a selected symbol clear;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check that the device ratings are suitable for the circuit in which they are to be used. For example, capacitor, diode, transistor, connector and switch voltage ratings, transistor, resistor and zener diode power dissipations, inductor, diode (including LED), transistor, connector and switch current ratings.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these parameters should have been checked at the time of specifying the components as an essential part of the circuit design stage prior to or during Schematic Capture, there is plenty of scope for them to have gone astray during the part selection, placement and editing steps of Schematic Capture.  </p>
<p>An undetected mistake now can result in the wrong size part being chosen. For example a larger diameter or even a taller electrolytic capacitor may be needed. Whilst this is easy to correct in the PCB design stage, at best this may waste time in having to redesign part of the PCB. At worst the mistake may not be discovered before the PCB design is completed and sent for manufacturing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that diode (including LED) and bipolar transistor base-emitter junction reverse breakdown voltage ratings and that input differential and common mode voltage ratings of operational amplifiers and comparators are not exceeded during any state of operation of the circuit including power up and power down. </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider adding diode or MOSFET reverse supply protection especially for battery powered circuits.</p>
<p>An example of MOSFET reverse protection is described in:</p>
<p><a href="https://easyeda.com/example/Uberclamp_Schematic_PCB_and_BoM-r4YgysK2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://easyeda.com/example/Uberclamp_Schematic_PCB_and_BoM-r4YgysK2k</a></p>
<p>Pay special attention to this in operational amplifier or comparator devices that exhibit <code>output phase reversal</code> under some input conditions. For more information about this see:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check that signal connectors have sufficient ground pins to maintain signal integrity by minimising signal return path impedances (i.e. ground loop area). This is especially important in designs with high speed signals through the connectors but can also be important for lower speed signalling with long wire interconnects and/or fast edge speeds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check that power connectors have sufficient ground and power pins pins to maintain power integrity by minimising power and ground return path impedances. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify that device power supply decoupling complies with manufacturers' recommendations. </p>

<h2>PCB Layout Tutorial</h2>
<a href="https://easyeda.com/feather/PCB_Layout_Tutorial-LztL3XfwO">PCB Layout Tutorial</a>

<p>In this <strong>PCB layout tutorial</strong> I hope to tell you how to create a good PCB layout very easily and clearly. I'd like to take <a href="https://easyeda.com">EasyEDA PCB design editor</a>  as an example because it's free, easy-to-use and without any installation but it brings you fast PCB design and easier circuit design experience.  </p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 1: Convert your schematic to a PCB</strong>
First you could draw your schematic on <a href="https://easyeda.com/editor">EasyEDA editor</a> as below image showed. I'm using this music controlled LED's schematic for this tutorial: </p>

<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8ca1c99218.png"><br>
Once you're done with your schematic, you could click on “<strong>Convert project to PCB</strong>”</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c7f1e9103.png"><br></p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 2: Placing the components</strong>
Now it's time to drag and drop the components to the spots where you want them to be.
If you want your PCB to look as clean as possible I suggest placing all components with the same function next to each other, like resistors for example.
Also make sure to leave some extra space between components, especially capacitors since the size may vary. Apart from the fact that the size may vary leaving some space will make the soldering a lot easier. Especially when you have to solder SMD components.</p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 3: Drawing a custom outline</strong>
First, select the “<strong>BoardOutline</strong>” layer in the <strong>layers menu</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c8208f200.png"><br>
Click on the current outline (the pink square in your editor) and press delete to get rid of it.
Now you can use the <strong>PCB tools</strong> to draw a new outline:</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c8394d2af.png"><br>
Once you're done with your outline you can switch back to either the top or bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 4: Creating a copper area (GND)</strong>
A very easy way to connect a lot of parts to a signal (mostly used GND) is to create a copper area.
You can create a copper area by using the tool “Copper Area” in the Tools menu.
Once you're done drawing just outside of the outline your PCB should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c859dfdbe.png"><br>
Now click on the dotted line you just drew and check whether these settings are correct. Once they are correct you can click “Rebuild CopperArea” and your PCB will be filled with copper only connecting to GND.</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c86398917.png"><br></p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 5: Routing</strong>
There are 2 different ways to perform this step. The easiest is to use the “Auto Router” function. If you're creating a PCB where the current is low you can use this method, but if you need different track sizes you're better off routing the PCB yourself.
The <strong>Auto Router</strong> function can be found here:</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c88688459.png"><br>
You should see blue lines all over the PCB. These indicate which component's pin is connected to which pin.</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c89c21fca.png"><br>
Now use the “Track” tool in the tools menu and click on a pad. Once you move your mouse you should see the blue line moving as well. Make sure not to cross any other tracks or pads and start routing all tracks to the correct pads.
You can switch to the opposite layer (top/bottom) if you have to cross lines.
If you have to switch to another layer for a SMD component you have to use a “via” which can also be found in the tools menu. A via is basically a copper connection between multiple layers.
This is an example of what your PCB could look like (With “Fill Style” None in the copper area properties):</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c8a5b0499.png"><br></p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 6: Adding holes</strong>
If you want to mount your PCB onto something it might be useful to add some holes.
Click on the “Hole” tool in the tools menu. Now you can set the size of the hole on the right.
<strong>Make sure you're using the right units!!</strong>
Once the size has been set you can click on the spots you want your holes to be.
Don't place holes onto components or tracks. Resize your PCB outline if you need more space to add the holes.</p>
<p><strong class="red">Step 7: Adding Text and Images</strong>
To add text click on the “Text” or “Image” tool in the tools menu. Place the text where you want it to be and change the text in the right properties menu.
You can also change the desired layer in the menu.</p>
<p>Step 8: Finalizing the PCB
You can take a look at the finished result by clicking on the <strong>“Photo View”</strong> button:</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c8ea3c49f.png"><br>
Once clicked you can find different options like top/bottom side, but also the color of the PCB.
Once you're satisfied with the result you can click on <strong>“Fabrication Output”</strong> to buy the PCB's using the service EasyEDA is also providing.</p>
<p><img src="https://easyeda.com/editor/20160926/57e8c8f823880.png"><br></p>

<h2>How to Design a PCB Layout</h2>
<a href="http://www.circuitbasics.com/make-custom-pcb/">How to Design a PCB Layout</a>
<br>
Breadboards are great for prototyping circuits, but they aren't so good for actually using the thing you're building. At some point, you'll probably want to make a project more permanent. The best way to do that is to put it on a PCB.

In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the process of designing a PCB layout and getting it printed by a custom PCB manufacturer. The performance of your circuit will depend greatly on how it's laid out on the PCB, so I'll give you lots of tips on how to optimize your design.

You can always etch PCBs at home with a process that's similar to developing prints from photographic film. But that method is messy and it uses a lot of chemicals. It's much easier (and cheaper) to get your PCB made by a professional manufacturer. To demonstrate the process, I'll use an online service called 
<a href="https://easyeda.com/" target="_blank">EasyEDA</a>
 to design a PCB layout for an LM386 audio amplifier, then I'll have it manufactured and show you the results. Their free online design software is easy to use and the rates are very affordable.

<h2>It All Starts With a Schematic</h2>

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-LM386-Audio-Amp-Schematic.png"><br>

Before you start designing your PCB, it's a good idea to make a schematic of your circuit. The schematic will serve as a blueprint for laying out the traces and placing the components on the PCB. Plus, the PCB editing software can import all of the components, footprints, and wires into the PCB file, which will make the design process easier (more on this later).

Start by logging in to <a href="http://www.easyeda.com" target="_blank">EasyEDA</a>, and create a new project:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-EasyEDA-Create-a-New-Project.png"><br>

Once you're on the Start page, click on the &#8220;new Schematic&#8221; tab:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-EasyEDA-New-Schematic-Tab.png"><br>

Now you'll see a blank canvas where you can draw the schematic:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-EasyEDA-Blank-Schematic.png 1280w">

It's best to place all of your schematic symbols on the canvas before drawing any wires. In EasyEDA, schematic symbols are located in &#8220;Libraries&#8221;. The default EasyEDA library has most of the common symbols, but there are also &#8220;User Generated Libraries&#8221; with lots of other symbols:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-EasyEDA-Libraries.png"><br>

Each schematic symbol you use needs to have a PCB footprint associated with it. The PCB footprint will define the component's physical dimensions and placement of the copper pads or through holes. Now is a good time to decide which components you'll be using.

The schematic symbols in the EasyEDA library already have footprints associated with them, but they can be changed if your're using a different size or style:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-EasyEDA-Package-Selection.png"><br>

To change the footprint associated with a schematic symbol, search in the &#8220;User Generated&#8221; libraries for a footprint that matches the component you're using. Once you find it, click on the heart icon to &#8220;Favorite&#8221; it:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Favorite-a-Schematic-Symbol.png"><br>

Then copy the name of the component:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Copy-the-Name-of-the-Schematic-Symbol-and-Footprint.png"><br>

Now click on the symbol in the schematic editor, and paste the name of the new footprint into the &#8220;package&#8221; field in the right sidebar menu (watch the video below for a demonstration):

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Changing-the-Package-Type.png"><br>

Once all of your symbols are placed on the schematic and you've assigned footprints to each symbol, it's time to start drawing the wires. Rather than explain the details of all that in this article, I've made a video so you can watch me draw the schematic for my LM386 audio amplifier:

After all the wiring is done, it's a good idea to label the symbols. The labels will be transferred over to the PCB layout and eventually be printed on the finished PCB. Each symbol has a name (R1, R2, C1, C2 etc.) and value (10 μF, 100 Ω, etc.) that can be edited by clicking on the label.

The next step is to import the schematic into the PCB editor, but before we do that, let's talk about some things to keep in mind when designing your PCB.

<h2>PCB Design Optimization</h2>

Identify what each part of your circuit does, and divide the circuit into sections according to function. For example, my 
<a href="http://www.circuitbasics.com/build-a-great-sounding-audio-amplifier-with-bass-boost-from-the-lm386/" target="_blank">LM386 audio amplifier circuit</a>
 has four main sections: a power supply, an audio input, the LM386, and an audio output. It might help to draw some diagrams at this point to help you visualize the design before you start laying it out.

Keep the components in each section grouped together in the same area of the PCB to keep the conductive traces short. Long traces can pick up electromagnetic radiation from other sources, which can cause interference and noise.

The different sections of your circuit should be arranged so the path of electrical current is as linear as possible. The signals in your circuit should flow in a direct path from one section to another, which will keep the traces shorter.

Each section of the circuit should be supplied power with separate traces of equal length. This is called a <em>star configuration</em>, and it ensures that each section gets an equal supply voltage. If sections are connected in a daisy-chain configuration, the current drawn from sections closer to the supply will create a voltage drop and result in lower voltages at sections further from the supply:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Daisy-Chained-vs-Star-Configuration.png"><br>

<h3>PCB Shape and Size</h3>

It's not uncommon to see round, triangular, or other interesting PCB shapes. Most PCBs are designed to be as small as possible, but that's not necessary if your application doesn't require it.

If you plan on putting the PCB into an enclosure, the dimensions may be limited by the size of the housing.  In that case, you'll need to know the enclosure's dimensions before laying out the PCB so that everything fits inside.

The components you use will also have an effect on the size of the finished PCB. For instance, surface mounted components are small and have a low profile, so you'll be able to make the PCB smaller. Through hole components are larger, but they're often easier to find and easier to solder.

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

The location of components like power connections, potentiometers, LEDs, and audio jacks in your finished project will affect how your PCB is laid out. Do you need an LED near a power switch to indicate that it's on? Or do you need to put a volume potentiometer next to a gain potentiometer? For the best user experience you might have to make some compromises and design the rest of your PCB around the locations of these components.

<h3>PCB Layers</h3>

Larger circuits can be difficult to design on a single layer PCB because it's hard to route the traces without intersecting one another. You might need to use two copper layers, with traces routed on both sides of the PCB.

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Single-Layer-PCB-vs-Double-Layer-PCB.png"><br>

The traces on one layer can be connected to the other layer with a <em>via</em>. A via is a copper plated hole in the PCB that electrically connects the top layer to the bottom layer. You can also connect top and bottom traces at a component's through hole:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Top-Layer-Trace-vs-Bottom-Layer-Trace-2.png"><br>

<h4>Ground Layers</h4>

Some double layer PCBs have a ground layer, where the entire bottom layer is covered with a copper plane connected to ground. The positive traces are routed on top and connections to ground are made with through holes or vias. Ground layers are good for circuits that are prone to interference, because the large area of copper acts as a shield against electromagnetic fields. They also help dissipate the heat generated by the components.

<h4>Layer Thickness</h4>

Most PCB manufacturers will let you order different layer thicknesses. <em>Copper weight</em> is the term manufacturers use to describe the layer thickness, and it's measured in ounces. The thickness of a layer will affect how much current can flow through the circuit without damaging the traces. Trace width is another factor that affects how much current can safely flow through the circuit (discussed below).  To determine safe values for width and thickness, you need to know the amperage that will flow through the trace in question. Use an 
<a href="http://circuitcalculator.com/wordpress/2006/01/31/pcb-trace-width-calculator/" target="_blank">online trace width calculator</a> to determine the ideal trace thickness and width for a given amperage.

<h3>PCB Traces</h3>

If you look at a professionally designed PCB, you'll probably notice that most of the copper traces bend at 45° angles. One reason for this is that 45° angles shorten the electrical path between components compared to 90° angles. Another reason is that high speed logic signals can get reflected off the back of the angle, causing interference:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-90-Degree-Trace-vs-45-Degree-Trace.png"><br>

If your project uses digital logic or high speed communication protocols above 200 MHz, you should probably avoid 90° angles and vias in your traces. For slower speed circuits, 90° traces won't have much of an effect on the performance of your circuit.

<h4>Trace Width</h4>

Like layer thickness, the width of your traces will affect how much current can flow through your circuit without damaging the circuit.

The proximity of traces to components and adjacent traces will also determine how wide your traces can be. If you're designing a small PCB with lots of traces and components, you might need to make the traces narrow for everything to fit.

<h2>Creating the PCB Layout</h2>

Now that we've discussed some off the ways you can optimize your PCB design, let's see how to layout a PCB in EasyEDA.

Open your schematic in the schematic editor, and click on the &#8220;Convert Project To PCB&#8221; button:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Convert-Schematic-to-PCB.png"><br>

The footprints associated with each schematic symbol will be automatically transferred to the PCB editor:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-EasyEDA-PCB-Editor.png"><br>

Notice the thin blue lines connecting the components. These are called <em>ratsnest</em> lines. Ratsnest lines are virtual wires that represent the connections between components. They show you where you need to route the traces according to the wiring connections you created in your schematic:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Ratsnest-Lines.png"><br>

Now you can start arranging the components, keeping in mind the design tips mentioned above. You might want to do some research to find out if there are any special design requirements for your circuit. Some circuits perform better with certain components in specific locations. For example, in an LM386 amplifier circuit the power supply decoupling capacitors need to be placed close to the chip to reduce noise.

After you've arranged all of the components, it's time to start drawing the traces. Use the ratsnest wires as a rough guide for routing each trace. However, they won't always show you the best way to route the traces, so it's a good idea to refer back to your schematic to verify the correct connections.

Traces can also be routed automatically using the software's <em>auto-router</em>. For complicated circuits, it's generally better to route traces manually, but try the auto-router on simpler designs and see what it comes up with. You can always adjust individual traces later.

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Manual-Routing-vs-Auto-Router.png"><br>

This video will show you how to draw traces in EasyEDA's PCB editor:

<iframe width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g4iiekExXak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>

</iframe>

Now it's time to define the size and shape of the PCB outline. Click on the board outline and drag each side until all of the components are inside:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-PCB-Outline.png"><br>

The last thing to do before placing the order is to run a <em>design rule check</em>. A design rule check will tell you if any components overlap or if traces are routed too close together. The design rule check can be found by clicking the &#8220;Design Manager&#8221; button in the right side window:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Design-Rule-Check-in-the-Design-Manager.png"><br>

Items that fail the design rule check will be listed below the &#8220;DRC Errors&#8221; folder. If you click on one of the errors, the problem trace or component will be highlighted in the PCB view:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Design-Rule-Check-Errors.png"><br>

You can specify your own settings for the design rule check by clicking the drop down menu in the upper right hand corner and going to Miscellaneous &gt; Design Rule Settings:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Create-Design-Rule-Settings.png"><br>

This will bring up a window where you can set design rules for trace width, distance between traces, and other useful parameters:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Design-Rule-Check-Options.png"><br>

At this point it's a good idea to double check your PCB layout against your schematic to make sure that everything is connected properly. If you're satisfied with the result, the next step is to order the PCB. EasyEDA makes this part really easy&#8230;

<h2>Ordering the PCB</h2>

Start by clicking the &#8220;Fabrication Output&#8221; button in the top menu of the PCB editor:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-PCB-Fabrication-Output-Button.png"><br>

This will take you to another screen where you can choose the options for your 
<a href="https://easyeda.com/order" target="_blank">PCB order</a>:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Ordering-the-PCB-from-EasyEDA.png"><br>

You can select the number of PCBs you want to order, the number of copper layers, the PCB thickness, copper weight, and even the PCB color. After you've made your selections, click &#8220;Save to Cart&#8221; and you'll be taken to a page where you can enter your shipping address and billing information.

You can also download your PCB's Gerber files if you want to send them to a different manufacturer:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Download-the-Gerber-Files-for-your-PCB.png"><br>

Gerber files are a set of image files that contain the patterns used to manufacture your PCB. All of the files are compressed into a single .zip file. There is a separate file for the copper traces, silk screen, and locations of drill holes and vias:

<img src="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-a-Custom-PCB-Gerber-Files.png"><br>

I ordered 15 PCBs for my LM386 audio amplifier circuit and the cost came out to about $15 USD. Manufacturing and shipping took about two weeks. The PCBs were well made, and I couldn't find any defects. After I soldered on the components and tested the amplifier, it worked great. You can
