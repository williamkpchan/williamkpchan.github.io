<h2>FAQ</h2><h2>About</h2>
<b>What is LMMS anyway?</b>
LMMS is part of a family of softwares known as digital audio workstations, or DAWs. 
It is a sound generation system, synthesizer, beat/bassline editor and MIDI control system that can power an entire home music studio. 
With LMMS, sounds and tones can be generated, played, and artfully arranged to create entire tracks with ease. 

The tools needed to arrange sounds and rhythms to create tracks, layer tracks to create songs, and save songs to an output format are all there, ready for you to use. 

With a MIDI keyboard, you can also play your music live while composing or performing.
<b>Is LMMS comparable to any commercially available software?</b>
Users may find LMMS has much in common, at least in principle, with Apple&#x27;s Garage Band, FL Studio (formerly Fruity Loops), Logic Studio, Beat Machine Pro and similar powerful audio tools. 
In terms of capability, LMMS easily matches the lower to middle-tier professional software available. 
This makes LMMS a great introduction to audio production. 
LMMS is also constantly developing.
<b>Is LMMS offered in my language?</b>
Possibly. 
See currently supported languages.
<b>Is it free?</b>
Yes. 
LMMS is free and open source. 
This means that as long as there are people coding for LMMS on their own free time, LMMS will become better and better!
<h2>2.1.2 Usage</h2>
<b>How do I create an instrument track in the Beat/Bassline Editor?</b>
Drag it in from the sidebar as you would with the Song Editor! You can open <em>My Samples or My Presets</em> (buttons on the far left side of the window) and double click on the preset to get it there too.
<b>How do I change the note an instrument plays in the Beat/Bassline Editor?</b>
Click on the instrument button on the track. 
There&#x27;s a green bar just above the keyboard at the bottom, an orange square indicates the key that is played. 
Click on the blue bar to change the note.
<b>How do I enable and adjust looping points?</b>
Click on the <em>enable/disable loop points</em> button in the song editor or piano roll. 
It is disabled by default. 
Two blue arrows will appear in the upper tracking area of the window. 
You can adjust these loop points by right-clicking and dragging them or pressing middle and right button.
<b>I made some piano chords in the Song-Editor but now I want to loop them. 
How to get them to the Beat+Bassline Editor?</b>
Simply hold Ctrl while dragging the instrument handle into the Beat+Bassline Editor. 
Only the first pattern will follow.
<b>How do I import a drums beat I&#x27;d made in Hydrogen?</b>
As of LMMS 0.4.14, you can import your Hydrogen file directly into LMMS. 
If you exported it as a MIDI, it can be easily imported with Project &gt; Import. 
Remember to specify a SoundFont file! If on the other hand, you exported it to WAV, you&#x27;ll have to use the AudioFileProcessor plugin and import it from there. 
You can import your MIDI the same way too.
<b>How do I import a FLAC, WAV or OGG file?</b>
Through the AudioFileProcessor plugin.
<b>Can I sell my song that I made in LMMS?</b>
Yes. 
As long as you have just used samples, instruments and effects from LMMS, or know that the external material has correct licenses, you can sell your song created in LMMS.
<b>How do I edit the locations in the sidebar when you open a file in LMMS?</b>
Highlight the folder that you want to be on the sidebar, select it, and drag it to the sidebar.
<b>What do I do when it is pops and clicks at the beginning or end of a note?</b>
Turn up the attack or the release knob.
<h2>2.1.3 Settings</h2>
<b>I want to use another soundcard than the default one with LMMS. 
How to achieve this?</b>
It&#x27;s recommended to set your preferred audio-interface and it&#x27;s parameters using the setup-dialog. 
If this doesn&#x27;t work for some reason, you can also set the environment-variable &quot;AUDIODEV&quot; to whatever your audio-device is (e.g. 
<em>/dev/dsp</em> for OSS or <em>surround40:1,0</em> for ALSA).
<b>I want to import MIDI files but it tells me I need to specify a default soundfont?</b>
First download a soundfont for free from the internet. 
Then in LMMS go to Edit &gt; Settings &gt; Paths (folder icon). 
Under the &quot;default soundfont file&quot;-section, you can browse for the downloaded file.

<h2>Buffer Size</h2>
Buffer size determines the latency of the audio coming out of LMMS, but values too low for your computer may cause unwanted audio artifacts that render the program unusable (Faster computers will be able to handle smaller buffer sizes). 

If you experience pops, crackles, or stuttering audio, an insufficient buffer size is likely the culprit (see 2.3.1.1).
As of 1.3, Buffer size settings are listed under Audio Settings.
<h2>Misc</h2>
<b>Enable tooltips:</b> This option enables informational tooltips to appear when hovering over controls.

<b>Show restart warning after changing settings:</b> This option enables or disables the warning pop-up window that appears after changing settings.

<b>Display volume as dBFS: </b>This option changes volume displays to use dBFS, a standard unit across many digital audio workstations, instead of the default 0-100.

<b>Compress project files per default: </b>This option saves storage space by using the compressed <code spellcheck="false">.mmpz</code> save file format rather than the larger <code spellcheck="false">.mmp</code> format.

<b>One instrument track window mode: </b>This option allows only one open instrument window at a time, meaning LMMS will close the previous instrument window when you open another one.

<b>HQ-mode for output audio-device:</b> This option improves the quality of playback sound for some output devices.

<b>Compact track buttons: </b>This option visually compacts tracks in the Song Editor by hiding track names and rearranging the solo &amp; mute controls for each track.

<b>Sync VST plugins to host playback: </b>This option allows VST plugins to utilize the project tempo, effectively allowing them to synchronize with LMMS.

<b>Enable note labels in piano roll: </b>This option labels notes with their note name in the piano roll when enabled.

<b>Enable waveform display by default: </b>This option allows the master output oscilloscope to be enabled by default.

<b>Keep effects running even without input: </b>This option prevents effects from sleeping when they don&#x27;t have input.

<b>Create backup file when saving a project:</b> This option creates a backup save file whenever you save a project, when enabled.

<b>Reopen last project file on start:</b> This option opens the last project you worked on when opening LMMS, rather than a blank project, when enabled.

As of 1.3, &quot;<b>Sync VST Plugins to host playback</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Keep effects running even without input</b>&quot; have been moved to Performance settings, and &quot;<b>HQ-mode for output audio-device</b>&quot; has been moved to Audio settings.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>Make sure you are running the latest version of LMMS before troubleshooting issues. 
The latest version can be found at https://lmms.io/download.
<h2>General Troubleshooting</h2>
<h2>My settings won&#x27;t save</h2>
Some users report that they can&#x27;t save their settings. 
This is a recurring Windows issue, with reason not known in depth. 
To solve this problem, follow these steps:

Close LMMS. 
Make sure nothing from LMMS is running in the background. 
You can look for this in your &quot;Task Manager&quot;. 
(If you don&#x27;t know how to use &quot;Task Manager&quot;, restarting your PC is a good alternative.)

In versions older than Windows 8, &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; is the folder you are looking for. 
In Windows 10, look in your &quot;C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\. 
There is a file called <code spellcheck="false"><b>.lmmsrc.xml</b></code>.

Use the search tool to find this file. 
<b>.lmmsrc.xml</b>You <em>can&#x27;t rename</em> this file, but you <em>can move</em> it.

Move it to one of the folders you have there, e.g. 
<b>plugins</b>. 
Now restart LMMS.

You should be now asked to enter new settings, and these settings should be persistent.

A terminal command version of this process exists:

Run CMD as administrator

Paste this command:

<code spellcheck="false">move %USERPROFILE%|.lmmsrc.xml %USERPROFILE%|.lmmsrc.xml.bak</code>
<h2>LMMS is taking forever to load a project</h2>
Try adding exceptions in your antivirus for files the project depends on, such as:

LMMS.exe

RemoteVstPlugin.exe

Plugins and their related data

<h2>Audio Troubleshooting</h2>
<h2>My Audio is Crackling</h2>
<h3>Buffer Size
</h3>Your buffer size may be too small, resulting in buffer underruns. 
To fix this, increase your buffer size. 
Note that this will increase latency.
<h3>Audio Interface
</h3>Certain audio interface configurations don&#x27;t play nice with LMMS on some systems. 
If you are on macOS or Windows, make sure you have SDL selected. 
On Linux, if PulseAudio is producing these unwanted artifacts, try ALSA instead.
<h3>Track Volume 
</h3>Your audio within LMMS may be too loud, resulting in digital clipping. 
This can be fixed by reducing the volume of the instruments in LMMS (either with the &quot;VOL&quot; knobs or through the mixer).
<h3>Volume Envelopes
</h3>If an instrument has attack or release values small enough, the rapid change in volume can sound like clicks or pops at the beginning or end of each note. 
Increasing the attack and release values for the culprit instrument&#x27;s volume envelope can fix this kind of clicking.
<h2>I Can&#x27;t Hear Anything</h2>
<h3>Dummy
</h3>Certain audio interface configurations (specifically Dummy) just don&#x27;t work. 
If you are on macOS or Windows, make sure you have SDL selected. 
Try to avoid PortAudio if possible.
<h3>JACK-transport
</h3>If you have JACK selected as your audio interface and you are experiencing no audio output, JACK-transport might not be running. 
Start an application like <code spellcheck="false">qjackctl</code> and click on &quot;play&quot; or its equivalent. 
LMMS should automatically should start JACK-transport on startup, but this fails on some systems.
You may also need to connect LMMS to your sound card, using the patch bay in <code spellcheck="false">qjackctl</code>.
<h2>The Audio Lags or is Delayed</h2>
<h3>Buffer Size 
</h3>​Buffer size is directly related to latency. 
If you can, try decreasing your buffer size to minimize latency.
<h2>Video Troubleshooting</h2>
<h2>LMMS has very small windows</h2>
<b>LINUX</b>
Try using a shell script:

#!/bin/bash
export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=&quot;0&quot;
export QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS=&quot;eDP-1=2.5;HDMI-1=2.5;DP-0=2.5&quot;.&lt;absolute path to lmms AppImage&gt;

Set <code spellcheck="false">chmod +x &lt;script name&gt;</code> and then make a symlink in a desired location.

You have to add all your connected monitors to QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS in order to make it work with all connected monitors.

<h2>Development Troubleshooting</h2>
<h2>LMMS Segfaults and There are No Error Messages on the Console</h2>
Use the GNU Debugger to run LMMS again, and try to replicate the crash:

$ gdb lmms
GNU gdb 6.X
Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...
​
(gdb) r
Starting program: lmms
...

If a segfault happens, LMMS will freeze and you&#x27;ll get some information on the terminal. 
Entering <code spellcheck="false">bt</code> or <code spellcheck="false">bt full</code> will show a backtrace you can report.
Make sure you have debugging symbols in LMMS. 
That usually means compiling with the <code spellcheck="false">-g</code> flag and not stripping the symbols afterwards.
<h2>I Compiled LMMS With VST-Support, but it Doesn&#x27;t Work at All</h2>
Make sure you didn&#x27;t pass <code spellcheck="false">-fomit-frame-pointer</code> in a FLAG-parameter to configure. 
This is known to lead to an unusable LVSL (LMMS VST Support Layer).

General Troubleshooting

There is a file called 
.lmmsrc.xml

.lmmsrc.xml
You 
can't rename this file, but you 
can move 
plugins

move %USERPROFILE%|.lmmsrc.xml %USERPROFILE%|.lmmsrc.xml.bak

To fix this, increase your buffer size. 
Note that this will increase latency.

Audio Interface

Certain 
audio interface configurations don't play nice with LMMS on some systems. 
If you are on macOS or Windows, make sure you have SDL selected. 
On Linux, if PulseAudio is producing these unwanted artifacts, try ALSA instead.

Track Volume 

Your audio within LMMS may be too loud, resulting in digital clipping. 
This can be fixed by reducing the volume of the instruments in LMMS (either with the \"VOL\" knobs or through the mixer).

Volume Envelopes

If an instrument has attack or release values small enough, the rapid change in volume can sound like clicks or pops at the beginning or end of each note. 
Increasing the attack and release values for the culprit instrument's volume envelope can fix this kind of clicking.

I Can't Hear Anything

Dummy

Certain 
audio interface configurations (specifically Dummy) just don't work. 
If you are on macOS or Windows, make sure you have SDL selected. 
Try to avoid PortAudio if possible.

JACK-transport

If you have JACK selected as your audio interface and you are experiencing no audio output, JACK-transport might not be running. 
Start an application like 
qjackctl and click on \"play\" or its equivalent. 
LMMS should automatically should start JACK-transport on startup, but this fails on some systems.

You may also need to connect LMMS to your sound card, using the patch bay in 
qjackctl
.

The Audio Lags or is Delayed

Buffer Size 

Buffer size is directly related to latency. 
If you can, try decreasing your buffer size to minimize latency.

Video Troubleshooting

LMMS has very small windows

LINUX

Try using a shell script:

export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=\"0\"

Set 
chmod +x \u003cscript name\u003e and then make a symlink in a desired location.

Development Troubleshooting

LMMS Segfaults and There are No Error Messages on the Console

Use the GNU Debugger to run LMMS again, and try to replicate the crash:

GNU gdb 6.X

Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

...

(gdb) r

Starting program: lmms

If a segfault happens, LMMS will freeze and you'll get some information on the terminal. 
Entering 
bt or 
bt full will show a backtrace you can report.

Make sure you have debugging symbols in LMMS. 
That usually means compiling with the 
-g flag and not stripping the symbols afterwards.

I Compiled LMMS With VST-Support, but it Doesn't Work at All

Make sure you didn't pass 
-fomit-frame-pointer

Toolbar

The toolbar has four sections: 

On the left hand side are two rows of buttons which can be controlled by clicking and keyboard shortcuts. 


The buttons are arranged in 2 rows. 
The top row contains buttons that handle the project (<b>file controls</b>). 
The bottom row has buttons that toggle the different  windows of the LMMS GUI (<b>window controls</b>).

In the center are three numerical displays for a <b>timer</b>, <b>tempo controls</b>, and <b>time signature controls</b>. 


To the right of the numerical displays are two sliders, one for <b>master volume</b> and the other for <b>master pitch</b>.

To the far right is a <b>Wave and Cpu usage display</b> which shows the current audio waveform being played and CPU usage. 


<h2>3.4.1 File Controls</h2>
The six buttons in the top row deal with opening and saving files.

​The <b>Create New Project</b> button creates a new project.

​The <b>Create New Project From Template</b> button creates a new project using a selected template.

​The <b>Open Existing Project</b> button opens an existing project file from your LMMS Working Directory (you are also able to point to other directories).

​The <b>Recently Opened Project</b> button lists files that you have saved recently. 
You can then choose a project to open from this list.

​The <b>Save Current Project</b> button saves the current project. 
If you have yet to save the current project, you will be asked to name it and select a directory to store it in.

​The <b>Export Current Project</b> button is a shortcut to export the current project as a .wav, .ogg, or .mp3 file (.flac is also avaliable for export as of 1.3). 


This opens the same dialog box as the file menu&#x27;s Export option.

<h2>3.4.2 Window Controls</h2>
The seven buttons in the second row show or hide various workspace windows. 
These are toggle buttons for the workspace windows, allowing you to work in a tabbed GUI. 

The toggle buttons are:

​The <b>Song-Editor</b> toggle button shows/hides the Song Editor.

​The <b>Beat+Bassline Editor</b> button shows/hides the Beat+Bassline Editor.

​The <b>Piano Roll Editor Window</b> button shows/hides the Piano Roll Editor. 
(Must be linked to a Piano Roll Clip before it can be used)

​The <b>Automation Window</b> button shows/hides the global-song Automation Editor window. 


​The <b>FX-Mixer</b> toggle-button shows/hides the FX-Mixer.

​The <b>Project Notes</b> button shows/hides the Project Notes window.

​The <b>Controller-rack</b> toggle button shows/hides the Controller-rack.

These buttons can be toggled on or off by clicking or by using keyboard shortcuts. 
The keyboard shortcuts are as follows, from left to right:

Song-Editor (F5)

Beat &amp; Bassline Editor (F6)

Piano-Roll (F7)

Piano-Roll (Ctrl+3)

Automation-Editor (Ctrl+4)

Mixer (Ctrl+5)

Project-Notes (Ctrl+7)

Controller-Rack (Ctrl+6)

In addition to these toolbar controls, all windows have a margin from which a Context Menu can be opened:

<b>Stay On Top</b> keeps that window on top of all other windows.

<b>Maximize</b> displays that window in fullscreen if possible.

<b>Move</b> makes the window follow the cursor until the left mouse button is pressed.

<b>Size </b>resizes the window (following the cursor) until the left mouse button is pressed.

<h2>3.4.3 Tempo Control</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lub_XEm_K52ChjNObie%2F-Lub__mSQk1gRWBRkWO0%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=e2e26a8a-f952-4627-a304-1e9b13fd6f93">

Tempo control

The tempo control displays the current tempo of the song. 
 The tempo can be adjusted in three ways: 

By left-clicking on the numerical display and, while continuing to hold the left mouse button down, moving the mouse up or down.

By left-clicking on the numerical display and, while continuing to hold the left mouse button down, rolling the mouse wheel up or down.

By double-clicking on the numerical display, a window will open which will allow you to type in a new numerical value for the tempo.

The tempo can also be automated like any other parameter.
<h2>3.4.4 Timer</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lub_imIia_t90su50jQ%2F-Lub_qwaxAk8yNUa1lUn%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=3e9155bf-9ba3-4cd5-97e1-06cca512cb63">

Timer

The timer shows the time from the beginning of the song to the current position of play-head. 
Clicking on the timer toggles it to instead show how many bars, beats, and ticks from the beginning of the song to the current position of the play-head. 
(Ticks subdivide beats, depending on the time-signature you have chosen.) 
<h2>3.4.5 Time Signature Controls</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lub_w4Dkf1tHpaXWmUO%2F-Luba1fh0kUfR4XjUJbw%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=544c7ffe-3e66-420f-80f9-7ab05294f43d">

Time signature controls

The default <b>time signature</b> is 4/4. 
You can change the time signature by holding the left mouse button down on the value you wish to change and dragging up or down with the mouse. 
You can also double-click to open a window which will allow you to type in a new value. 


The top number dictates the number of beats per measure, and the bottom number dictates the value (eighth, sixteenth, etc.) of each beat.

<h2>3.4.6 Master Volume and Pitch Controls</h2>
To the right of the tempo control are the master volume and pitch controls.
​The <b>Master Volume</b> control sets the master volume for the entire project.
​The <b>Master Pitch</b> control transposes all instruments except those with the Master Pitch toggle disabled.
Both are controlled by holding the left mouse button down on the slider and dragging it up or down with the mouse. 

<h2>3.4.6 Wave and CPU Usage Display</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LubaNwlC5O89Tz2AY-x%2F-LubaT7Ixq8fhB2Cv3jy%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=c8a99f96-6f41-4ff5-8371-3e03e0bdfa91">

Wave and CPU usage display

The <b>Wave/CPU display</b> shows both the current waveform being played and the current CPU usage of all LMMS instruments, effects, and sequencing. 
You can turn the wave display off or on by left-clicking it. 
When it is disabled, it will read &quot;Click to enable&quot;.
For the waveform display color:

Export Current Project button is a shortcut to export the current project as a .wav, .ogg, or .mp3 file (.flac is also avaliable for export as of 1.3). 


3.4.2 Window Controls

The seven buttons in the second row show or hide various workspace windows. 
These are toggle buttons for the workspace windows, allowing you to work in a tabbed GUI. 


The toggle buttons are:

The 
Song-Editor 
The 
Beat+Bassline Editor 
The 
Piano Roll Editor Window 
The 
Automation Window 
The 
FX-Mixer 
The 
Project Notes 
The 
Controller-rack 
These buttons can be toggled on or off by clicking or by using keyboard shortcuts. 
The keyboard shortcuts are as follows, from left to right:

As of LMMS 1.3, the shortcuts are:

In addition to these toolbar controls, all windows have a margin from which a Context Menu can be opened:

 
 
 

3.4.3 Tempo Control

The tempo control displays the current tempo of the song. 
 The tempo can be adjusted in three ways: 

The tempo can also be automated like any other parameter.

3.4.4 Timer

The timer shows the time from the beginning of the song to the current position of play-head. 
Clicking on the timer toggles it to instead show how many bars, beats, and ticks from the beginning of the song to the current position of the play-head. 
(Ticks subdivide beats, depending on the time-signature you have chosen.) 

3.4.5 Time Signature Controls

The default 
time signature is 4/4. 
You can change the time signature by holding the left mouse button down on the value you wish to change and dragging up or down with the mouse. 
You can also double-click to open a window which will allow you to type in a new value. 


3.4.6 Master Volume and Pitch Controls

To the right of the tempo control are the master volume and pitch controls.

The 
Master Volume control sets the master volume for the entire project.

The 
Master Pitch control transposes all instruments except those with the Master Pitch toggle disabled.

Both are controlled by holding the left mouse button down on the slider and dragging it up or down with the mouse. 


3.4.6 Wave and CPU Usage Display

The 
Wave/CPU display shows both the current waveform being played and the current CPU usage of all LMMS instruments, effects, and sequencing. 
You can turn the wave display off or on by left-clicking it. 
When it is disabled, it will read \"Click to enable\".\nFor the waveform display color: 

<h2>3.5 Sidebar</h2>The Sidebar is permanently attached to the left side of the window. 
It has 2 modes: retracted and extended. 
In retracted mode it looks like this:

Retracted mode

It has six sections that provide easy access to the various <b>elements</b> (instruments, samples files, and presets) that you will use in LMMS. 
When you click on any one section label, the side bar will extend and show you the contents of that section. 
Click the section label again to retract the bar.
<h2>3.5.1 Instrument Plugins</h2>
When you click on the Instrument Plugins button (), the sidebar expands to show you the available instrument plugins:

My Samples

These folders are the same as on your computer, allowing you a convenient way to open sounds and presets on your hard disk from within LMMS.
Open folders can be smart-searched, so you can find an item with a token search. 
Use the small input-field in the bottom. 
Just enter a few characters from the item&#x27;s filename, and the smart-search in LMMS will filter the names in the currently open folder. 
<b>Smart-search does </b><em><b>not</b></em><b> search sub-folders!</b>
To the right of the input-field there is an Update button. 
If you can&#x27;t find a newly created file, click the Update button: all the folders are updated and the tree will collapse (this is also an easy way to close all open folders).
Let&#x27;s take a closer look at the tabs.

My Projects

The second option in the sidebar; a shortcut to the project folder-browser. 
Depending on your user-created sub-folders, there will be a browser-tree. 
Double-click on the name of the project you want to load. 
Wait for the project to load <em>completely</em>, before using other features in LMMS!
The next 2 tabs on the side-bar contain your instruments. 
They are the Samples and the Instruments. 
Both have similar behavior.

My Samples

My samples gives you easy access to LMMS samples collection. 
Samples can be WAV, OGG and FLAC sound files. 
You have smart-search and can update the display. 
To preview the sample, <b>left-click and hold</b> on its name. 
Drag the sample to the Song-Editor or the Beat+Bassline Editor to add it as a new track. 
When you drag-and-drop a sample into either editor, the new track will be added at the bottom of the track list. 
You can drag the grip dots on the left end of the track to move the track to where you want it in the track list. 
Double-click the sample to add it to the Beat+Bassline Editor as a new track. 
The mouse cursor symbol will show a reject-sign as you drag if the sample can&#x27;t be dropped into that window.
<h2>3.5.5 My Presets</h2>

My Presets

My presets gives you easy access to a collection of predefined instruments. 
Presets are instrument plugins with pre-saved settings and tuned controls. 
You have search field at the bottom, and can update the display by clicking the refresh button. 
<em><b>Warning:</b></em> you should make it a habit to save your project <b>before</b> you preview a preset (i.e. 
before you<b> left-click and hold</b> on a preset), because sometimes previewing can crash LMMS. 
Another thing you must remember is to never preview VeSTige preset! VSTs are not build by the LMMS-team, and they can&#x27;t be handled as our own instruments can. 
I repeat: never preview VSTs!
Drag the preset to the Song-Editor or the Beat+Bassline Editor to add it as a new track. 
If you drag a preset into (i.e. 
on top of) an existing preset in either of the editors, it will replace the previous preset. 
Otherwise, when you drag-and-drop a preset into either editor, the new track will be added at the bottom of the track list. 
You can drag the grip dots on the left end of the track to move the track to where you want it in the track list. 
Double-click the preset to add it to the Beat+Bassline Editor as a new track. 
The mouse cursor symbol will show a null sign as you drag if the preset can&#x27;t be dropped into that window. 
You can also right-click any preset, and use the context-menu, to add it to the editors. 
This way of adding presets, gives you very good control, and you should always use this method, when you handle VSTs.

ENV/LFO tab

<h3>3.6.2.2.1 Envelopes
</h3>Envelope of an instrument is how loud or soft it is from the moment the note is pressed, over after it it released, to when the sound is completely silent. 
Immediately before the note is pressed, the envelope is at zero and the instrument produces no sound. 
The note goes through an <b>attack</b> from when the note is pressed until it reaches its maximum loudness. 
From then there is an initial <b>hold</b> period when the note remains at maximum loudness. 
The note then <b>decay</b>s to a softer pitch which is the <b>sustain</b> level. 
Finally when note is <b>release</b>d, it fades away to silence. 
There may also be a <b>pre-delay</b> between when the note is pressed and when the volume starts rising.
The ENV/LFO/Filter section has three sub-tabs that select the target for three separate envelopes. 
The default one, and the one discussed above, is the volume target. 
You can select the target in the same way that you select the tab in the instrument, by clicking on the label. 
To control the envelope, you have six knobs to set each of the above parameters - <b>pre-delay</b> (DEL), <b>attack</b>, <b>hold</b>, <b>decay</b>, <b>sustain</b>, <b>release</b> - and a 7. 
one to control the <b>amount</b> (AMT) of the effect that the envelope has on the parameter.
For the volume envelope, this &quot;amount&quot; does not actually affect the sound - the envelope only works if the amount control is 100% on. 
Note that you can either set the amount using its knob or click on the envelope graph in order to turn it completely on or off. 
The graph is green when it&#x27;s turned on, grey when off and a shade between those two colors when the control is between fully on (1) and fully off (0). 
The amount can also be turned down to negative one, a feature which is only useful for the Cutoff and Q/Reso targets.
<h3>3.6.2.2.2 Filters
</h3>In order to enable the filter, press the filter titlebar and the light at the left will turn on. 
When this light is on, the filter is active. 
Keep in mind that filtering the sound of an instrument adds a small calculation overhead and can add a slight delay to the sound, so if you&#x27;re not using the filter then keep it off.
The types of filters in LMMS:

​ <b>Lowpass: </b>this filter lets low frequencies through

​ <b>Highpass:</b> this filter lets high frequencies through

​ <b>Bandpass csg</b> and <b>Bandpass czpg:</b> these filters let only a certain band frequencies through

​ <b>Notch:</b> the inverse of the Bandpass filter, this cuts only a certain frequency band

​ <b>Allpass:</b> a filter that lets all frequencies through but has the same phase shifts, time delays and resonance properties as other filters

​ <b>Moog:</b> a modification to the normal Lowpass filter made popular by Moog synthesizers

​ <b>2x Lowpass: </b>a lowpass filter with twice the Q factor

Each type of filter lets you control the <b>cutoff</b> frequency and the <b>Q/Reso</b>nance amount. 
You can experiment with this by choosing a plugin that generates multiple frequencies - using anything other than a sine wave will do that - and then set the cutoff and Q factor and see how it changes the sound.
<h3><b>3.6.2.2.2.1 Filters with envelopes</b>
</h3>Filters do not have to be static and unchanged throughout the entire note. 
LMMS allows you to control both the cutoff frequency and the Q factor via an envelope. 
Nor does this envelope have to be the same as the volume envelope for the note - each parameter can have an independent envelope. 
The envelope sets the value from its maximum or minimum to the set control level; for example, if a lowpass filter has the cutoff control set to 1kHz and an envelope is used to sweep this value up in a long attack and long decay, the value of the control will go from 14kHz (the maximum) down to 1kHz and then back up. 
This will make the instrument sound like it&#x27;s been damped down and then the damping removed.
<h3>3.6.2.2.3 LFO
</h3><em>All LFO effects takes place through a filter, so the first thing is to activate the filter (light ON) and choose one from the drop-down.</em>
The LFO provided by LMMS allows you to control the value of the volume, cutoff and Q factor targets independently - the LFO for each is shown under the same tab as the envelope for the same target. 
Each has four parameters that you can set:

The <b>delay</b> before the oscillator starts

The <b>attack</b> or fade-in rate of the oscillator - the rate at which it goes from starting to having full effect

The <b>speed</b> of oscillation. 
This is probably the parameter you are most likely to use. 
It is measured in milliseconds per oscillation, because often one knows the time taken for a complete cycle rather than the rate in Hz (this is also because the accuracy of setting the LFO in fractions of a Hz is less than setting it in fractions of a second). 
If right-click the knob, LMMS opens a contex menu, and you will have the option to beat-synchronize the speed. 
This is a b feature and very useful for wobble or dubstep instruments.

The <b>amount</b> that the LFO affects the given target. 
Like an envelope, you can either set the amoun control manually or click on the waveform display at the left of the LFO to turn it on or off.

LMMS also has an LFO plugin. 
This is inserted in the Controller rack.
<h2>3.6.2.3 FUNC</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lucb6645VDUat-6RcLG%2F-LucbHwZ3eiCONC4Uet1%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=953dcb3a-67c6-4e7a-97f3-48f52c397566">

FUNC tab

Normally, each &quot;note down&quot; command plays one note in the instrument. 
With the <b>Arp/Chord</b> controls, you can change this so that it plays a <b>chord</b> (with the root note being the note played) and/or and <b>arpeggio</b> (i.e. 
the notes of the chord played one after another rather than simultaneously). 
To control this, the Arp/Chord tab is divided into two sections, one for the chords and the other for arpeggios. 
You turn them on by clicking on their title bar and the light at the left will turn on. 
By default they will be turned off.
Both sections have two common controls - the <b>list of chords</b> that can be played and the <b>range in octaves</b> over which the chord will be played. 
Since some chords span more than one octave, some chords or arpeggios will overlap. 
The list of chords available is vast, ranging from standard chords through jazz to regional chords and natural modes such as Lydian and Dorian.
<h3>3.6.2.3.1 Chords
</h3>The chords section has no other controls than the ones listed above. 
When a note down signal is received, that note will be the base for the rest of the chord. 
All the notes of the chord will play simultaneously until the note is released.
<h3>3.6.2.3.2 Arpeggios
</h3>The arpeggios section has a number of extra controls:

The <b>direction</b> that the arpeggio is played in can be selected from up, down, both directions (up then down) and random notes from the chord.

The <b>time</b> (in milliseconds) between each note. 
Right-click opens context menu to set <b>tempo sync.</b>

The <b>gate</b> time (as a percentage of the note time above). 
At 100%, each note will be played for the full time between each note. 
At less, each note will be cut short and the rest will be filled with silence. 
At more than this, each note will overlap the next note and will finish later than the start of the nest.

The <b>mode</b> of playing arpeggio

In <b>free</b> mode, an arpeggio will be started when the note starts. 
If a second note is played later, a second arpeggio will start at that (later) time and play independently of the first.

In <b>sort</b> mode, no matter when another note is pressed, the arpeggios will be played in the same order, with only one note being played at any given time. 
For example, if the key for C is played with an ascending Major chord arpeggio, the arpeggio of C-E-G will be played repeatedly. 
If the key for F is then held down, the arpeggio will play C-E-G-F-A-C one after the other - the arpeggio for C then the arpeggio for F.

In <b>sync </b>mode, any notes held down at the same time will play a chord arpeggio in that interval. 
To take the above example, when F was held down the arpeggio would play CF-EA-GC repeatedly - the notes C and F simultaneously, then the notes E and A, then the notes G and C.

FX tab

The LADSPA effects allow many ways to control the sound of an instrument. 
These can vary from simple effects like delays and echos to complex phasers, distortion and reverbation. 
Effects can also be chained one after the other to produce very complex sounds.
When you add an effect the green light will automatically turn on. 
When it is off the sound isn&#x27;t processed by the effect. 
You can easily check the &quot;dry&quot; sound of the instrument without effects, against the &quot;wet&quot; sound with the effects in place, by turning the green light off.
Click the &quot;add&quot; button to select a new LADSPA/VST effect to add to the chain. 
This then gives you several controls over the process of sending sound to and receiving it from the effect:

The <b>W/D (wet/dry)</b> knob sets the ratio between the input signal and the effect signal that forms the output

The <b>decay</b> control sets how much silence must pass before the effect turns off completely. 
Turning the effect off reduces the amount of CPU time used processing silence and reduces the chance of unwanted noise. 
However, if the effect turns off too soon it may introduce a &quot;clipped&quot; sound to the effect: for instance, in the case of a reverb, if the reverb time is longer than the decay time then the reverb will be cut off before it has fully died away. 
You should make it a habit to always match the decay of effects and this decay knob.

The <b>gate</b> threshold controls the level of noise in which below the instrument will be considered to be silent. 
A flanger effect placed on an instrument with a very long fade-out (say a ride cymball) will be almost inaudible at the end of the tail of the cymball. 
Cutting the effect off early may reduce the CPU requirements and the chance of unwanted effect noise being heard.

The <b>controls</b> button displays (or removes) the separate window giving the controls specific to this effect.

Note that some effects will also have ways to set their internal wet/dry level. 
This sometimes takes the form of a wet/dry knob, but can also be two knobs to set the level of the wet output and the level of the dry, bypassed, output.
To remove an effect, select its context menu (right-click) and choose &quot;Remove effect&quot;.
You can also change the order of any effect in the effect rack by moving it up or down.

MIDI tab

These controls allow you to set which MIDI channel the instrument receives MIDI events on, and which it sends events to. 
Both these controls work in similar ways:

Click the <b>Receive MIDI-events</b> or <b>Send MIDI-events</b> title next to the light to turn the reception or sending of MIDI events on or off

The <b>channel</b> setting controls which MIDI channel events will be received or sent on

The <b>Default velocity</b> control clamps all incoming or outgoing notes to once velocity when set

The <b>Device selector</b> button shows a list of which devices in your system can act as sources or sinks for MIDI events

<h2>3.6.3 Piano Keys</h2>
At the bottom of the instrument window is a small section of a piano keyboard. 
This will display the notes that are playing by greying out the key or keys as they&#x27;re played. 
The scroll bar at the bottom of the screen allows you to move up and down, i.e. 
left and right, the keyboard to see different ranges of notes.

Piano keys in instrument window

<h2>3.6.3.1 Base Note</h2>
In addition, the green mark just above the keys shows the base note of the keyboard. 
Whichever note you select with this mark will be played as A4, i.e. 
the concert pitch of 440Hz. 
For instance, moving this to A3 will make all the notes played move up by an octave (since A3 is now A4 and so forth). 
This allows you to adjust an individual instrument to be pitched correctly in relation to all the others. 
This is mostly unimportant for synthesizers where the A4 note is programmed to be 440Hz. 
However, for the AudioFileProcessor pugin, this is extremely useful, as it allows you to adjust the note to be played back at its correct pitch. 
As an example, if you recorded a saxophone playing a B♭, you would adjust the base note to be B♭, so that the saxophone was played in the same pitch as your other instruments.
<h2>3.6.3.2 Keyboard</h2>
When the instrument window is selected, you can use the keyboard of your computer to play notes in a two-octave range. 
In addition, any MIDI keyboard can be used to send MIDI command to this instrument when it&#x27;s selected.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lu8Es772sqf0qhp7IYA%2F-Lu8Fp9BbU0hOaV7OPkJ%2Fkeyboar.png?alt=media&amp;token=ee70aa9d-8f19-4c32-bca2-a3fed404748e">

Keyboard as piano

The window is divided up into three main sections:

instrument controls 

sound controls 

piano keys 
3.6.1 Instrument Controls

 

The pitch range dial is not available on all instruments. 
All other of these controls are present on all LMMS factory instruments.

3.6.2 Sound Controls

 

 
 
 
Let's take a closer look at these tabs.

3.6.2.1 Plugin

The plugin tab contains all the controls that set how this plugin actually generates sound. 
For more information, read the individual plugin's page.

3.6.2.2 ENV/LFO

3.6.2.2.1 Envelopes

Envelope of an instrument is how loud or soft it is from the moment the note is pressed, over after it it released, to when the sound is completely silent. 
Immediately before the note is pressed, the envelope is at zero and the instrument produces no sound. 
The note goes through an 
attack from when the note is pressed until it reaches its maximum loudness. 
From then there is an initial 
hold period when the note remains at maximum loudness. 
The note then 
decay
s to a softer pitch which is the 
sustain level. 
Finally when note is 
release
d, it fades away to silence. 
There may also be a 
pre-delay between when the note is pressed and when the volume starts rising.

The ENV/LFO/Filter section has three sub-tabs that select the target for three separate envelopes. 
The default one, and the one discussed above, is the volume target. 
You can select the target in the same way that you select the tab in the instrument, by clicking on the label. 
To control the envelope, you have six knobs to set each of the above parameters - 
pre-delay (DEL), 
attack
, 
hold
, 
decay
, 
sustain
, 
release - and a 7. 
one to control the 
amount (AMT) of the effect that the envelope has on the parameter.

For the volume envelope, this \"amount\" does not actually affect the sound - the envelope only works if the amount control is 100% on. 
Note that you can either set the amount using its knob or click on the envelope graph in order to turn it completely on or off. 
The graph is green when it's turned on, grey when off and a shade between those two colors when the control is between fully on (1) and fully off (0). 
The amount can also be turned down to negative one, a feature which is only useful for the Cutoff and Q/Reso targets.

3.6.2.2.2 Filters

In order to enable the filter, press the filter titlebar and the light at the left will turn on. 
When this light is on, the filter is active. 
Keep in mind that filtering the sound of an instrument adds a small calculation overhead and can add a slight delay to the sound, so if you're not using the filter then keep it off.

The types of filters in LMMS:

 
Lowpass: 
 
Highpass:  
Bandpass csg and 
Bandpass czpg:  
Notch:  
Allpass:  
Moog:  
2x Lowpass: 

Each type of filter lets you control the 
cutoff frequency and the 
Q/Reso
nance amount. 
You can experiment with this by choosing a plugin that generates multiple frequencies - using anything other than a sine wave will do that - and then set the cutoff and Q factor and see how it changes the sound.

3.6.2.2.2.1 Filters with envelopes

Filters do not have to be static and unchanged throughout the entire note. 
LMMS allows you to control both the cutoff frequency and the Q factor via an envelope. 
Nor does this envelope have to be the same as the volume envelope for the note - each parameter can have an independent envelope. 
The envelope sets the value from its maximum or minimum to the set control level; for example, if a lowpass filter has the cutoff control set to 1kHz and an envelope is used to sweep this value up in a long attack and long decay, the value of the control will go from 14kHz (the maximum) down to 1kHz and then back up. 
This will make the instrument sound like it's been damped down and then the damping removed.

3.6.2.2.3 LFO

All LFO effects takes place through a filter, so the first thing is to activate the filter (light ON) and choose one from the drop-down.

The LFO provided by LMMS allows you to control the value of the volume, cutoff and Q factor targets independently - the LFO for each is shown under the same tab as the envelope for the same target. 
Each has four parameters that you can set:

delay 

attack 

speed 

amount 
LMMS also has an LFO plugin. 
This is inserted in the Controller rack.

3.6.2.3 FUNC

Normally, each \"note down\" command plays one note in the instrument. 
With the 
Arp/Chord controls, you can change this so that it plays a 
chord (with the root note being the note played) and/or and 
arpeggio (i.e. 
the notes of the chord played one after another rather than simultaneously). 
To control this, the Arp/Chord tab is divided into two sections, one for the chords and the other for arpeggios. 
You turn them on by clicking on their title bar and the light at the left will turn on. 
By default they will be turned off.

Both sections have two common controls - the 
list of chords that can be played and the 
range in octaves over which the chord will be played. 
Since some chords span more than one octave, some chords or arpeggios will overlap. 
The list of chords available is vast, ranging from standard chords through jazz to regional chords and natural modes such as Lydian and Dorian.

3.6.2.3.1 Chords

The chords section has no other controls than the ones listed above. 
When a note down signal is received, that note will be the base for the rest of the chord. 
All the notes of the chord will play simultaneously until the note is released.

3.6.2.3.2 Arpeggios

The arpeggios section has a number of extra controls:

direction 

time (in milliseconds) between each note. 
Right-click opens context menu to set 

gate 

mode of playing arpeggio

free 

sort 

sync 

3.6.2.4 FX

The LADSPA effects allow many ways to control the sound of an instrument. 
These can vary from simple effects like delays and echos to complex phasers, distortion and reverbation. 
Effects can also be chained one after the other to produce very complex sounds.

When you add an effect the green light will automatically turn on. 
When it is off the sound isn't processed by the effect. 
You can easily check the \"dry\" sound of the instrument without effects, against the \"wet\" sound with the effects in place, by turning the green light off.

Click the \"add\" button to select a new LADSPA/VST effect to add to the chain. 
This then gives you several controls over the process of sending sound to and receiving it from the effect:

W/D (wet/dry) 

decay 

gate 

controls 
Note that some effects will also have ways to set their internal wet/dry level. 
This sometimes takes the form of a wet/dry knob, but can also be two knobs to set the level of the wet output and the level of the dry, bypassed, output.

To remove an effect, select its context menu (right-click) and choose \"Remove effect\".\nYou can also change the order of any effect in the effect rack by moving it up or down.

3.6.2.5 MIDI

These controls allow you to set which MIDI channel the instrument receives MIDI events on, and which it sends events to. 
Both these controls work in similar ways:

Receive MIDI-events or 
Send MIDI-events 

channel 

Default velocity 

Device selector 
3.6.3 Piano Keys

At the bottom of the instrument window is a small section of a piano keyboard. 
This will display the notes that are playing by greying out the key or keys as they're played. 
The scroll bar at the bottom of the screen allows you to move up and down, i.e. 
left and right, the keyboard to see different ranges of notes.

3.6.3.1 Base Note

In addition, the green mark just above the keys shows the base note of the keyboard. 
Whichever note you select with this mark will be played as A4, i.e. 
the concert pitch of 440Hz. 
For instance, moving this to A3 will make all the notes played move up by an octave (since A3 is now A4 and so forth). 
This allows you to adjust an individual instrument to be pitched correctly in relation to all the others. 
This is mostly unimportant for synthesizers where the A4 note is programmed to be 440Hz. 
However, for the AudioFileProcessor pugin, this is extremely useful, as it allows you to adjust the note to be played back at its correct pitch. 
As an example, if you recorded a saxophone playing a B♭, you would adjust the base note to be B♭, so that the saxophone was played in the same pitch as your other instruments.

3.6.3.2 Keyboard

When the instrument window is selected, you can use the keyboard of your computer to play notes in a two-octave range. 
In addition, any MIDI keyboard can be used to send MIDI command to this instrument when it's selected.

Song Editor

The left side of the window displays the instrument and beat/bassline tracks

The right side of the window displays the actual content - the note blocks, or <em>segments</em> of each track at each bar in the project

<h2>3.7.1 Working with Segments</h2>
Each track has content in the form of <b>segments</b> or <b>elements</b>, often you will hear other users using the term &quot;blocks&quot;.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lucc5B2pRFgWAsHpOlt%2F-LuccIeERjr1lwQVyHna%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=124d111f-2448-473b-9976-55ac35400c57">

Instrument track block

For <b>instrument tracks</b>, the display is a miniature piano roll. 
Double-clicking on it will open the Piano Roll Editor window where you can add, delete, or modify individual notes.

Sample track block

For <b>sample tracks</b>, the display is a miniature waveform of the sample. 
Double-clicking on it will open a File-Open dialog where you can choose a new sample for that element. 
LMMS can&#x27;t edit recorded sounds, nor can LMMS record sound!

Beat/Bassline track block

For <b>Beat/Bassline tracks</b>, the display is simply a colored block/segment showing that the beat/bassline is active. 
Double-clicking on it will open the Beat+Bassline Editor window where you can add, delete, or modify individual notes in the beat.

To <b>create new segments</b>, left-click in the track activity area within the bar where you want the segment to start. 
For instrument and sample tracks, this creates a blank area where you can put notes or samples. 
For beat/bassline tracks, this creates 1 (or more) bars filled with that particular Beat+Bassline as configured.

To <b>move a segment</b>, drag it by clicking and holding the segment. 
As it&#x27;s dragged, the segment will snap to the start of any bar, but you can free drag (with a 1/64th resolution) by holding down the Ctrl key <em><b>after</b></em> you begin dragging (Ctrl+drag before you begin dragging initiates the &quot;copy&quot; procedure).

To <b>copy a segment</b>, hold the Ctrl key down <em><b>before</b></em> you begin dragging and then drag the copy to its new location. 
You can also right-click on the segment, select <em>copy</em>, left-click to create an empty segment where you want the copy to go, right-click and select <em>paste</em>. 
You can&#x27;t copy segments of one track type to tracks of a different type. 
To copy again, the Ctrl key has to be released and repressed before the next drag operation.

To <b>delete a segment</b>, click it using the middle mouse button or right-click on it and select <em>delete</em>. 
Double-clicking on a block opens the Piano Roll or Beat+Bassline Editor, so you can <b>edit the segment&#x27;s contents</b>.

Draw mode tool icon

Despite their different content, the ways of working with segments are mostly similar. 
Most of the work in the Song Editor is done using the <b>Draw mode</b> tool.

<em>Left-click</em> in an empty bar to <b>add a segment</b>

<em>Middle-click</em> on a block to <b>delete it</b>

<em>Ctrl+middle-click</em> is a <b>mute/unmute</b> toggle for that block

<em>Right-click</em> on a segment to <b>get a context menu</b>

<em>Left-drag</em> on a segment to <b>move it</b> (block will snap to bar boundaries)

<em>Ctrl </em><b><em>after</em></b><em> left-drag</em> begins on a segment to <b>move it freely</b> (won&#x27;t snap to bar boundaries)

<em>Ctrl </em><b><em>before</em></b><em> left-drag</em> begins on a segment to <b>copy it</b>

When you <em>hover your mouse over the right end of a segment</em>, the mouse cursor becomes a double-headed arrow so you can drag the end of the segment to make it extend over more or fewer bars (this does not work for instrument tracks)

<em>left-drag:</em> the segment extension/retraction snaps to bar boundaries

<em>Ctrl+left-drag:</em> the segment extension/retraction is free (does not snap to bar boundaries)

<h3>3.7.2.1.2 Edit Mode Tool
</h3>
<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lucd9X4XfJIJumBtE-n%2F-LucdEpW4_2rESm7LFOT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=87594fe9-2b05-4dd4-b134-c9d580b18a22">

Edit mode tool icon

The <b>Edit mode</b> tool, also known as the selection tool, allows you to drag a rectangular selection box that selects multiple segments. 
You can then handle the selection as a group. 
Selected segments change their color to distinct them from unselected.

<em>Ctrl+left-click</em> on any segment you want to <b>remove from the selection group</b>

<em>Drag horizontally</em> on any selected segment to <b>move the selection group:</b>

<em>left-drag:</em> movement where segments <b>snap</b> to bar boundaries

<em>Alt+left-drag:</em> free movement (segments <b>don&#x27;t snap</b> to bar boundaries)

<em>Click</em> on any empty bar to <b>clear the selection</b> from the selected segments

Marked blocks can not only be moved, but can be copied (Ctrl+c) and inserted (Ctrl+v) at the play-head position, anywhere in your project. 
You can also delete (DEL) marked blocks. 
It is recommended that you use the magnification settings, to find the magnification, that gives you the best view of your project. 
Since 1.2, LMMS has a 12.5% magnification, that allows you to see 350 bars of your project!
<h2>3.7.2.2 Changing Structure in a Project</h2>
Sometimes whole segment of a project is either needed to be removed, or you need space to insert new blocks. 
This is where you use INSERT and DELETE.
First you move the play-head to the position where you want the change.
<h3>3.72.2.1 Expanding a Project
</h3><em>Shift+Insert key</em> inserts a new, empty bar to the right of the play-head&#x27;s current position into <b>all </b>the tracks. 
You will essentially push everything upwards, and hence have a longer project, as the result!
<h3>3.7.2.2.2 Condensing a Project
</h3><em>Shift+Delete key</em> moves <b>all</b> one bar to the left of the play-head&#x27;s current position. 
You will essentially pull everything downwards, and hence have a shorter project as the result!
Both methods are powerful tools for making big changes in your project.
<h2>3.7.2.3 Navigating</h2>
The scroll bars at the right and bottom of the window allow you to move the editors view around, but you can also scroll with your mouse-wheel.
Use <em>Shift+mouse wheel</em> to scroll horizontally, <em>Ctrl+mouse wheel</em> to scroll vertically.
<h2>3.7.2.4 Playback Controls</h2>
​The <b>Play</b> button starts playback at the current play-head position. 
The keyboard space bar has the similar functionality, depending on the settings for play-head behavior of the <em>Return mode</em> button (see below).
​During playback, a <b>Pause</b> button icon represents the Play button icon. 
It will pause playback and leave the play-head at its current position.
​The <b>Stop</b> button (or keyboard space bar) stops playback (or a paused playback), and returns the play-head to the location defined by the <em>Return mode</em> button.
The <b>Return mode</b> button is a 3-position toggle that controls where the play-head moves when you halt playback using the Stop button. 
There are 3 modes:

​<b>Back to Zero (default): </b>the play-head returns to the beginning of the song (bar #1)

​<b>Back to start: </b>the play-head returns to the position where this playback started

​<b>Continue:</b> the play-head remains where it was stopped, i.e. 
it doesn&#x27;t move

​The <b>Auto-scroll</b> button is ON by default. 
During playback, the view in the Song Editor window will automatically scroll horizontally to display the current play-head position. 
As the play-head moves past the right edge of the window, the window will scroll horizontally so the play-head continues at the left edge. 
In the performance settings, the option &quot;smooth scrolling&quot; can be enables. 
With Auto-scroll OFF, the play-head can disappear during playback.
​Loops in LMMS are understood as 1-n bars! It is the logic of a sequencer that determines that loops are the same as <em>whole</em> bars. 
The <b>Loop-points</b> button is OFF by default. 
When turned ON, the loop will appear (bright green) on the timeline. 
You can set the loop-points as follows:

When you click on the time bar for setting right-loop-point use <em>right-click</em> <em>only</em>

When you click on the time-bar for setting left-loop-point use <em>Shift+right-click</em>

Setting loop-points will by default <em>snap</em> to the bar dividers. 
You can control that. 
If you hold AltGr, then you can set your loop exactly as you want. 
You can even drag them up and down.
During Song Editor playback, the play-head will loop continuously between the start and end loop-points. 
This is useful for testing a particular section of your piece, but only exists in playback mode. 
It is not a way to repeat a section a certain number of times within your composition - you&#x27;ll have to use copy/paste for that.
<h2>3.7.2.5 Adding Tracks</h2>
There is no button for adding a new instrument track. 
You do this by dragging the desired plugin or preset from the Sidebar to an empty area in the Song Editor. 
Next, click on the instrument track&#x27;s name to show/hide the Instrument Editor window for that plugin. 
This window is where you can make changes to the sound of the instrument.
​To add a new Beat/Bassline track, click the <b>Add beat/bassline</b> button. 
Right-click on the beat/bassline track&#x27;s name to rename it.
​To add a new sample track, click the <b>Add sample-track</b> button.

Track settings bar

The left side of the track, the track settings bar, contains buttons and controls that allow you to work with the tracks as a whole.
​The stippled area at the left end of the track is the <b>Grip handle</b>. 
In Draw mode, use it to drag a track up or down in the track stacking order. 
The track order has no effect on the sounds produced, it just helps you keep things organized. 
Ctrl+drag on the grip handle makes a clone of the track that you can place either at the bottom of the track list, in Beat+Bassline Editor, or even in an other opened project, if you have enough RAM for two instances of LMMS. 
You use considerable less RAM if you only copy-drag, and do not play any of the projects!
​The <b>Track tools</b> icon has a tool-tip that says &quot;Actions for this track&quot;. 
Click it to see a menu with options:

<b>Clone this track</b> makes an exact copy of the track (instrument settings and segments) and pastes it at the bottom of the track list

<b>Remove this track</b> deletes the track

<b>MIDI:</b> option for instruments to connect a MIDI device

​The <b>Mute/unmute toggle</b> looks like a green light that you turn ON and OFF by clicking on it. 
Use it to turn off the sounds from this track temporarily. 
For example, you may want to hear the track of an accompanying instrument without hearing the lead instrument. 
As all knobs, lights and faders in LMMS these can be automated. 
The <b>Solo/unsolo toggle</b> is the second light, the one to the right. 
It is a red light that you turn on and off by clicking on it. 
Use it to turn off temporarily all the other tracks except this track, or add some other tracks to the playback, simply by un-muting any track of your own choice. 
That way you can have one solo track plus any number of selected tracks playing together alone. 
When you want to have all tracks active again, you simply unsolo the solo track. 
That will unmute all tracks in your Song Editor again.
The rest of the track settings bar displays the <b>sound source</b> information. 
This varies somewhat between instrument tracks, sample tracks and beat/bassline tracks.

<h2>3.7.4 Track Context Menu</h2>
The track context menu appears when you right-click on a segment in the track. 
The options available vary by the type of track as follows:
<h2>3.7.4.1 Instrument Track Context Menu</h2>

<img src="https://lmms.io/wiki/images/4/44/Instrument_track_context_menu1.0.0.png">

Instrument track context menu

<b>Open in piano-roll</b> opens the clicked-on pattern in the Piano Roll Editor

<b>Delete</b> deletes the clicked-on segment

<b>Cut</b> removes the clicked-on segment and puts it in the clipboard

<b>Copy</b> makes a copy of the clicked-on segment and puts it in the clipboard

<b>Paste</b> pastes the contents of the clipboard into this segment, overwriting its previous contents. 
The segment name is copied and pasted with the contents of the segment which helps you see the original source of this segment (see &quot;Change name&quot; below).

<b>Mute/unmute</b> allows you to turn off the sound of the clicked-on segment. 
It does not affect the volume of the other segments in the track.

<b>Clear all notes</b> allows you to erase the contents of the clicked-on segment without deleting the segment itself

<b>Reset name</b> resets the segment name to the track name, and the name is again hidden

<b>Change name</b> allows you to change a segment&#x27;s name. 
Segments within a track can have their own names, and by default the segment name is the same as the track name.

<b>Add steps</b> and <b>Remove steps</b> allow you to add or remove the number of steps in a bar. 
This is the same option as in the Beat+Bassline Editor.

The actions of each option are essentially the same as those for the instrument track above. 
The only addition is:

<b>Change color</b> allows you to change the color of the segments in the BB track. 
This helps you to distinguish the function or content of the tracks by their color, and helps you to quickly know which bassline you are dealing with in a complex rhythm sections. 
You can use the edit mode tool aka selection tool to select a group of Beat/Bassline segments and color them all at once.

<h2>3.7.5 Reusing and Copying Tracks</h2>
Sometimes you may like to use notes you have in another project. 
You can&#x27;t use the notes in other projects just as a <em>reference</em>, but! You can copy these notes from one project to another! Let&#x27;s say we have a nice arpeggio, and we&#x27;d like to reuse that within a tiny change, in a new project.
<h2>3.7.5.1 Method 1</h2>
If you have decent hardware, with 2+ GB of RAM, you can have two LMMS running simultaneously. 
Point to the track with the existing arpeggio. 
On the track button we have a <em>nobbled</em> bar leftmost in this picture:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LucgQTHfZAoV8maJmMN%2F-LucgTm3aMuCk0gcPzfB%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=39310851-a2f0-4284-8378-4341c428242b">

Beat/Bassline track bar

Hold Ctrl

Point on the nobbled bar

Press and drag the whole track button from the &quot;donor&quot; project to the receiveing project&#x27;s Song Editor

</ol>You now have copied all notes and the preset into the new project. 
In our case we would have &quot;both&quot; the arpeggio-notes, &quot;and&quot; all the arpeggio settings in the preset copied to the new project. 
If you create a project called something like .my-aprs.mmp, and build all the arps, you can think of, then you can use that project as a <em>template</em> for any project, and that way you have an arpeggio library.
<h2>3.7.5.2 Method 2</h2>
This is not at all as potent, byt can be used by anyone, despite low-end HW.
Open the piano-roll pattern in project 1

Mark all (Ctrl+a)

Copy all (Ctrl+c)

Create a new project or open an existing project

Open a piano-roll in that project

Insert the notes from the first project (Ctrl+v)

</ol>As you can see we only had one instance of LMMS open, and this is a very CPU and RAM friendly way to copy between projects, but we only got notes from one note block, with this simple method.

segments 
3.7.1 Working with Segments

Each track has content in the form of 
segments or 
elements
, often you will hear other users using the term \"blocks\".

For 
instrument tracks
, the display is a miniature piano roll. 
Double-clicking on it will open the Piano Roll Editor window where you can add, delete, or modify individual notes.

For 
sample tracks
, the display is a miniature waveform of the sample. 
Double-clicking on it will open a File-Open dialog where you can choose a new sample for that element. 
LMMS can't edit recorded sounds, nor can LMMS record sound!

For 
Beat/Bassline tracks
, the display is simply a colored block/segment showing that the beat/bassline is active. 
Double-clicking on it will open the Beat+Bassline Editor window where you can add, delete, or modify individual notes in the beat.

create new segments

move a segment
, drag it by clicking and holding the segment. 
As it's dragged, the segment will snap to the start of any bar, but you can free drag (with a 1/64th resolution) by holding down the Ctrl key 
after 

copy a segment
, hold the Ctrl key down 
before you begin dragging and then drag the copy to its new location. 
You can also right-click on the segment, select 
copy
, left-click to create an empty segment where you want the copy to go, right-click and select 
paste

delete a segment
, click it using the middle mouse button or right-click on it and select 
delete
. 
Double-clicking on a block opens the Piano Roll or Beat+Bassline Editor, so you can 
edit the segment's contents

3.7.2 Toolbar

The Song Editor window has a toolbar that allows you to control playback of the song, add new tracks, choose edit tools, customize the method of playback, and control the general view of the song.

3.7.2.1 Editing Tools

3.7.2.1.1 Draw Mode Tool

Despite their different content, the ways of working with segments are mostly similar. 
Most of the work in the Song Editor is done using the 
Draw mode tool.

 in an empty bar to 

 on a block to 

 is a 
mute/unmute

 on a segment to 
move it 
after left-drag begins on a segment to 
move it freely 
before left-drag begins on a segment to 

hover your mouse over the right end of a segment
, the mouse cursor becomes a double-headed arrow so you can drag the end of the segment to make it extend over more or fewer bars (this does not work for instrument tracks)

 
 
3.7.2.1.2 Edit Mode Tool

The 
Edit mode tool, also known as the selection tool, allows you to drag a rectangular selection box that selects multiple segments. 
You can then handle the selection as a group. 
Selected segments change their color to distinct them from unselected.

 on any segment you want to 

 on any selected segment to 
move the selection group:

 movement where segments 
snap 
 free movement (segments 
don't snap 
 on any empty bar to 
clear the selection 
Marked blocks can not only be moved, but can be copied (Ctrl+c) and inserted (Ctrl+v) at the play-head position, anywhere in your project. 
You can also delete (DEL) marked blocks. 
It is recommended that you use the magnification settings, to find the magnification, that gives you the best view of your project. 
Since 1.2, LMMS has a 12.5% magnification, that allows you to see 350 bars of your project!

3.7.2.2 Changing Structure in a Project

Sometimes whole segment of a project is either needed to be removed, or you need space to insert new blocks. 
This is where you use INSERT and DELETE.\nFirst you move the play-head to the position where you want the change.

3.72.2.1 Expanding a Project

Shift+Insert key inserts a new, empty bar to the right of the play-head's current position into 
all 
the tracks. 
You will essentially push everything upwards, and hence have a longer project, as the result!

3.7.2.2.2 Condensing a Project

Shift+Delete key moves 
all one bar to the left of the play-head's current position. 
You will essentially pull everything downwards, and hence have a shorter project as the result!

Both methods are powerful tools for making big changes in your project.

3.7.2.3 Navigating

The scroll bars at the right and bottom of the window allow you to move the editors view around, but you can also scroll with your mouse-wheel.

Use 
Shift+mouse wheel to scroll horizontally, 
Ctrl+mouse wheel to scroll vertically.

3.7.2.4 Playback Controls

The 
Play button starts playback at the current play-head position. 
The keyboard space bar has the similar functionality, depending on the settings for play-head behavior of the 
Return mode button (see below).

During playback, a 
Pause button icon represents the Play button icon. 
It will pause playback and leave the play-head at its current position.

The 
Stop button (or keyboard space bar) stops playback (or a paused playback), and returns the play-head to the location defined by the 
Return mode button.

The 
Return mode button is a 3-position toggle that controls where the play-head moves when you halt playback using the Stop button. 
There are 3 modes:

Back to Zero (default): 

Back to start: 

Continue: 

The 
Auto-scroll button is ON by default. 
During playback, the view in the Song Editor window will automatically scroll horizontally to display the current play-head position. 
As the play-head moves past the right edge of the window, the window will scroll horizontally so the play-head continues at the left edge. 
In the performance settings, the option \"smooth scrolling\" can be enables. 
With Auto-scroll OFF, the play-head can disappear during playback.

Loops in LMMS are understood as 1-n bars! It is the logic of a sequencer that determines that loops are the same as 
whole bars. 
The 
Loop-points button is OFF by default. 
When turned ON, the loop will appear (bright green) on the timeline. 
You can set the loop-points as follows:

right-click 

Setting loop-points will by default 
snap to the bar dividers. 
You can control that. 
If you hold AltGr, then you can set your loop exactly as you want. 
You can even drag them up and down.

During Song Editor playback, the play-head will loop continuously between the start and end loop-points. 
This is useful for testing a particular section of your piece, but only exists in playback mode. 
It is not a way to repeat a section a certain number of times within your composition - you'll have to use copy/paste for that.

3.7.2.5 Adding Tracks

There is no button for adding a new instrument track. 
You do this by dragging the desired plugin or preset from the Sidebar to an empty area in the Song Editor. 
Next, click on the instrument track's name to show/hide the Instrument Editor window for that plugin. 
This window is where you can make changes to the sound of the instrument.

To add a new Beat/Bassline track, click the 
Add beat/bassline button. 
Right-click on the beat/bassline track's name to rename it.

To add a new sample track, click the 
Add sample-track button.

3.7.2.6 Zoom Controls

You can zoom in to show fewer bars or zoom out to show more bars in the window. 
There are several ways to zoom:

]

]

3.7.2.7 Changing Track Height

Anywhere in a track, use Shift+drag to change the height of a track. 
You can only make it taller than the default height, not shorter.

3.7.3 Track Settings Bar

The left side of the track, the track settings bar, contains buttons and controls that allow you to work with the tracks as a whole.

The stippled area at the left end of the track is the 
Grip handle
. 
In Draw mode, use it to drag a track up or down in the track stacking order. 
The track order has no effect on the sounds produced, it just helps you keep things organized. 
Ctrl+drag on the grip handle makes a clone of the track that you can place either at the bottom of the track list, in Beat+Bassline Editor, or even in an other opened project, if you have enough RAM for two instances of LMMS. 
You use considerable less RAM if you only copy-drag, and do not play any of the projects!

The 
Track tools icon has a tool-tip that says \"Actions for this track\". 
Click it to see a menu with options:

 
 
 

The 
Mute/unmute toggle looks like a green light that you turn ON and OFF by clicking on it. 
Use it to turn off the sounds from this track temporarily. 
For example, you may want to hear the track of an accompanying instrument without hearing the lead instrument. 
As all knobs, lights and faders in LMMS these can be automated. 
The 
Solo/unsolo toggle is the second light, the one to the right. 
It is a red light that you turn on and off by clicking on it. 
Use it to turn off temporarily all the other tracks except this track, or add some other tracks to the playback, simply by un-muting any track of your own choice. 
That way you can have one solo track plus any number of selected tracks playing together alone. 
When you want to have all tracks active again, you simply unsolo the solo track. 
That will unmute all tracks in your Song Editor again.

The rest of the track settings bar displays the 
sound source information. 
This varies somewhat between instrument tracks, sample tracks and beat/bassline tracks.

<b>Play </b>and <b>Stop</b> buttons allow you to play and stop the currently selected Beat/Bassline (BB) track. 
When <b>Play</b> is pressed, it will be replaced with a <b>Pause</b> symbol allowing you to pause the playback rather than stop it entirely. 
<b>Stop</b> returns the play-head to the first step in the BB track; <b>Pause</b> allows you to continue from the last played step. 
<b>Add steps</b> and <b>Remove steps</b> allow you to add or remove the number of steps in a bar.
​The drop-down menu allows you to select the BB track to edit. 
It displays the current <b>Beat/Bassline (BB)</b> <b>track</b> being edited.
​The <b>Add Beat/Bassline </b>button creates a new Beat/Bassline track in the Song Editor, numbered sequentially from &quot;Beat/Bassline 0&quot;. 
Right-click on the new BB track&#x27;s name in the Song Editor and rename it to something useful.

All BB tracks are linked in such a way that they share the same instruments.

If you delete or toggle-mute an instrument in one BB track, the effect will be applied in all BB tracks within this project. 
So, if you have multiple BB tracks in your song, remember that all the BB tracks will contain the same instruments. 
This means that you&#x27;ll have to enforce silence on those instruments that you want silenced in a particular BB track. 
For example, say you have a first BB track with a kick drum, snare, and HiHat, and a second BB track with just a clap and a shaker. 
All 5 instruments will be in both BB tracks. 
You&#x27;ll want the clap and shaker instruments in the first track to be silent, so in the first track, for both the clap and shaker, you can either

Make sure all the steps are turned off (see Context menu clear below)

Context menu mute the track (toggle mute won&#x27;t work because the instrument will be toggle muted in all other BB tracks)

Also, you&#x27;ll have to do the same thing to the kick, snare, and HiHat in the second BB track to make sure those 3 are silent.

Instrument track

Each instrument added to the Beat+Bassline Editor will look like this. 
The track settings you recognize from the Song Editor are on the left side and the Step Editor is on the right (the gray boxes).
<h2>3.8.2.1 Step Editor</h2>
By default an instrument track has 16 steps (16 gray boxes), 4 steps to each beat in a 4-beat bar.
Each step icon is both an on/off toggle and a volume knob. 
A left-click on a step toggles it on or off. 
To change its volume, hover your mouse over step and raise or lower its volume by rolling your mouse scroll wheel up or down. 
The step is bright green at full volume, gray at zero volume, and an intermediate brightness of green at intermediate volumes. 
A left-click will still turn the step on or off, and the step remembers its last volume setting. 
Editing the volume of a step in the Piano Roll (see below) is also reflected in the color brightness of a step. 

When a step is turned on, the sound from the instrument will play at that step in the bar.
The 4 steps in each beat group are shaded alternately light and dark gray to make orientation easier.
Right-clicking on a step gives you the context menu for that track.

You'll want the clap and shaker instruments in the first track to be silent, so in the first track, for both the clap and shaker, you can either

Also, you'll have to do the same thing to the kick, snare, and HiHat in the second BB track to make sure those 3 are silent.

The 
Add automation track button adds a new automation track to the current BB track.

3.8.2 Instrument Track

Each instrument added to the Beat+Bassline Editor will look like this. 
The track settings you recognize from the Song Editor are on the left side and the Step Editor is on the right (the gray boxes).

3.8.2.1 Step Editor

By default an instrument track has 16 steps (16 gray boxes), 4 steps to each beat in a 4-beat bar.

Each step icon is both an on/off toggle and a volume knob. 
A left-click on a step toggles it on or off. 
To change its volume, hover your mouse over step and raise or lower its volume by rolling your mouse scroll wheel up or down. 
The step is bright green at full volume, gray at zero volume, and an intermediate brightness of green at intermediate volumes. 
A left-click will still turn the step on or off, and the step remembers its last volume setting. 
Editing the volume of a step in the Piano Roll (see below) is also reflected in the color brightness of a step. 


When a step is turned on, the sound from the instrument will play at that step in the bar.

The 4 steps in each beat group are shaded alternately light and dark gray to make orientation easier.

Right-clicking on a step gives you the context menu for that track.

Piano Roll Editor

The Piano Roll Editor is the main workspace for composing and editing melodies and harmonies. 
It can be accessed through either the right-click context menu on or double-clicking on:

a segment in an instrument track, e.g. 
​

a step in a track in the Beat+Bassline Editor

It can also be accessed using the <b>Show/Hide Piano-Roll button</b>in the main toolbar (shortcut F7, or Ctrl+3 in 1.3). 


Notice that the <b>Show/Hide Piano-Roll button</b> opens the last edited segment. 
If you just started a new session (not to be confused with starting a new project), you must first connect Piano Roll to a segment to be able to use it. 
LMMS <em>will not</em> remember the last edited segment from one session to another.

Many of the tools are similar to those found in the Song Editor, with several important additions listed (listed below).
<h2>3.9.1.1 Playback and Record</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiHGfd6Gum2EVsiyXp%2F-LuiHKWo8PT2srK-VjyB%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=78a6f923-7f59-422a-b67e-3e5b492467cd">

Playback and record buttons

In addition to the Playback and Stop controls, there are two <b>Record</b> buttons which will record the notes you play on either:

an attached MIDI keyboard  

your computer&#x27;s keyboard  

Either Clickto start recording without playing Song Editor/B&amp;B tracks, or Clickto start recording with Song Editor/B&amp;B tracks playing.
Press to stop playback or recording. 
The computer keyboard&#x27;s <b>spacebar</b> can toggle between Playback and Stop in both playback and record modes. 

As of 1.3,  allows you to record notes one at a time.

After you press stop, you will be able to see all the notes you played in the Piano Roll. 
These notes can be edited just like any other notes.
<h2>3.9.1.2 Editing</h2>

Editing tools

Selected notes can be manipulated together. 
Some keyboard shortcuts include: 

Moving the selection (left click + drag)

Copying the selection (Shift+left click + drag)

Transposing the selection (Shift/Ctrl + arrow keys). 
Shift will move the selection one beat/semitone at a time, while Ctrl will move the selection one octave/measure at a time.

The 4 editing modes (tools) are <b>Draw</b>, <b>Erase</b>, <b>Select</b>, and <b>Detune</b>.
You can draw notes with Left click and erase with Right click. 
(These are explained in further detail in the Edit Notes subsection of this Section).
The <b>Select</b> mode tool allows you to select individual notes to create a group or &quot;<b>selection</b>&quot; of notes, which you can manipulate.

<b>Rectangular Selection:</b> use the Select tool to drag a rectangular area around some notes. 
When you release the mouse button, the selected notes will turn blue.

<b>Individual Selection:</b> use the Select tool to left-click on a note - it will turn blue

<b>Add to (or remove from) Selection:</b> you can add more notes to the current selection by holding down the Shift key (Shift+drag or Shift+click) and the additional notes will turn blue, too.

Detuning (Note similarities to Automation Editor)

The <b>Detune</b> mode allows you to edit the frequency profile of an individual note. 
When you click on a note, an Automation Editor window opens for that note, and from here you can use your mouse to plot points for a Detune profile graph, this profile will be used to alter the final pitch of the edited note when played. 

Notice that in Piano roll, edited notes will have green lines that reveal their Detune profile.

VST instruments cannot have per-note detuning. 
You may still detune the instrument as a whole from the Instrument Window&#x27;s &quot;PITCH&quot; knob.

The note(s) will snap to the nearest time increment as set in the Quantization drop-down menu.

<b>Alt+drag</b> to move the note(s) either left/right in time or up/down in pitch, but without snapping to the nearest time increment. 
Instead, the note(s) will &quot;free-drag&quot; and snap to the nearest 1/192 time increment (max Quantization in LMMS).

Hover over the right end of the note until a <b>two headed arrow</b> appears, then

<b>Drag</b> the end of a note to the left/right to change the length of the note(s) in accordance to the current selected quantization.

<b>Alt+drag</b> the end of a note to the left/right to change the length of the note(s). 
The right end of the note(s) will &quot;free-drag&quot; and snap to the nearest 1/192 time increment, i.e.

Automation Editor not connected to a segment

The Automation Editor allows you to control the value of any automatable control at any point in time during the song. 
This allows you anything from very simple effects like turning up the volume of an instrument at the start of the song, to very complex manipulation of envelopes or instrument filters. 
Even the controls in LADSPA effects and VST effects can be automated!
As the Piano Roll, you must connect the Automation Editor to a segment, in this case an Automation segment. 
If you open the Automation Editor (shortcur F8), and it looks like the image, close it and double-click on an Automation track segment to connect to.
<h2>What Can Be Automated?</h2>
<b>Controls</b> are the knobs, sliders, light switches, digital readouts, etc, that can be found in the LMMS GUI. 
All controls on default LMMS GUI can be automated, including the following types

Light switches:​

Digital readout (FX numbers, pitch range):​

Option buttons:​

Sliders:​

Knobs:​

If you&#x27;re unsure if a control can be automated, right-click on its icon and look for a contex menu item called <b>Edit song-global automation</b>. 
If it&#x27;s there, the item probably can be automated. 
Most ZynAddSubFX controls do not support automation.

<h2>Editing Automation</h2>

Editing automation

The image shows a typical view of the automation window. 
The window title <b>Automation Editor-Lead&gt;Volume</b> tells you that you are editing the automation graph of the &quot;Volume&quot; control that belongs to the track named &quot;Lead&quot;. 
The image does not show this correctly because the automation is not connected to a control.
The main part of the window is a <b>graph</b> of the <b>value</b> of the control over <b>time</b>. 
Time is listen along the horizontal axis (at the top of the window) in the units of bars (a.k.a. 
the &quot;timeline&quot;). 
The value of the control is listed along the vertical axis at the left of the window in whatever units the control uses. 
Within the graphing area, the mouse cursor is linked to the horizontal and vertical axes by red lines to make it easier to see where you are working in both dimensions. 
How you should interpret the bar numbers in the Automation Editor depends on which method you are using to automate a control - Song-global or Automation track.
The blue part of the graph provides an easy way to see the curve of the graph. 
The area between the curve and zero is shaded blue. 
In the case of a volume control, all the values are zero or greater, so zero is at the bottom of the value scale. 
For controls where the value can be negative, for example, a stereo pan control, the &quot;zero line&quot; is in the middle of the graph and blue shading can occur on either side of the zero line.
<h2>Control Points</h2>
The red circle () is the <b>control point</b>. 
The automation graph must always go through these points. 
After the last point the automation graph will be a straight line, the value of the last point could last in infinity, but is limited by the length of the segment in the Song Editor.
<h3>Drawing Control Points
</h3>Using the <b>Draw mode</b> tool (pencil - ), you can create new control points simply by clicking on (or near) a vertical line. 
In all cases, if control point already exists somewhere on that vertical line, it will be removed to where you clicked. 
If a control point does not exist on that vertical line, it will be created there. 
You can move an existing point up/down its vertical line by dragging it directly - you are reshaping the graph.
You can delete a control point by right-clicking (same as deleting a note in the Piano Roll Editor).
The timeline spacing of control points as you draw is set by the <b>Q</b> (quantization) setting (). 
By default this is set to 1/16 which means 16 control points per bar (or a control point vertical line every 1/16th of a bar). 
You don&#x27;t have to have a control point at every point that is possible - a horizontal line only requires 2 control points (one at each end).
<h3>Working with Selections
</h3>Operations such as cut, copy, paste, delete, and move selection operate on 1+ <b>selected</b> control points.
​ The <b>Select mode</b> tool allows you to drag a rectangular area around 1+ points to select them. 
The vertical orange bar of the point(s) will turn blue. 
You can also use Ctrl+A which will select all the control points in the Automation Editor. 
You can the cut, copy, delete, and/or paste the selected points.
Use the <b>Delete</b> key on the computer keyboard to delete the selected points.
The <b>Paste</b> operation uses both the timeline position (horizontal value) and the control value (vertical value) of the control points when pasting them into a new (or the same) automation track block. 
Beware the vertical value might not make sense for a different control. 
After pasting, the pasted points are still selected, which allows you to move them as a group. 
For example, if you copied the control points from bars 20 to 30 from one automation block and pasted them into a different automation block, the points will occupy bars 20 to 30 in the new block, but, because they are still selected, you can move them to a different location.
​The <b>Move selection mode</b> tool allow you to move (by dragging) the selected control points and without regard for the Q setting. 
The selection will move at the maximum Q of 1/192. 
This is similar to the &quot;free drag&quot; (Alt+drag) of notes in the Piano Roll. 
Beware while moving a selection that any existing points that the selection passes over will be deleted!
<h3>Erasing Control Points
</h3>​The <b>Erase mode</b> tool can delete control points, as can right-clicking on them.

The Automation Editor allows you to control the value of any automatable control at any point in time during the song. 
This allows you anything from very simple effects like turning up the volume of an instrument at the start of the song, to very complex manipulation of envelopes or instrument filters. 
Even the controls in LADSPA effects and VST effects can be automated!

As the Piano Roll, you must connect the Automation Editor to a segment, in this case an Automation segment. 
If you open the Automation Editor (shortcur F8), and it looks like the image, close it and double-click on an Automation track segment to connect to.

What Can Be Automated?

Controls are the knobs, sliders, light switches, digital readouts, etc, that can be found in the LMMS GUI. 
All controls on default LMMS GUI can be automated, including the following types

If you're unsure if a control can be automated, right-click on its icon and look for a contex menu item called 
Edit song-global automation
. 
If it's there, the item probably can be automated. 
Most ZynAddSubFX controls do not support automation. 
You can automate any controls on third-party VST instruments by clicking on the \"Control VST plugin\" icon 

.

<h2>3.13 Controller Rack</h2>Controllers are used to vary the position of a knob or other control over time using another signal such as an LFO waveform. 
They differ from automation because automation uses a shape drawn manually and usually the shape is not a repeated pattern. 
In contrast, LFO controllers use waveforms to yield a regular pattern.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiMc_cDOc4FMgNEYWm%2F-LuiMmxd0EeEcgji_9Ml%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=6c463664-9423-4e61-af19-83d398d52335">

Controller rack

The Controller Rack displays all the controllers created within this project.
There are 2 types of controllers:

LFO controller

Peak controller

The right-click context menu allows you only 1 options: &quot;Remove this controller&quot;. 
You can change the names of the controllers by double-clicking on the current controller name.
<h2>3.13.1 LFO Controller</h2>
LFO stands for <b>Low Frequency Oscillator</b>.
​This button is the Controller Rack show/hide toggle button (F11). 
To add an LFO controller entry to the Controller Rack, click the Add button at the bottom of the window.
To edit the settings for a particular LFO controller entry, click the Controls button on the right side of the entry. 
The LFO controller settings are:

8 waveform option buttons

4 knobs

BASE: the center (or zero line) around which the wave oscillates

SPD: speed is the rate (frequency) of wave oscillation

AMP: amount is the size (amplitude) of the wave

PHS: phase offset is where in the waveform the wave starts its first oscillation

3 speed-multiplier option buttons

<h2>3.13.2 Peak controller</h2>
A Peak controller allows you to use the volume peaks from an audio source to automate the values of a control. 
A Peak controller is similar to Gate, but with greater flexibility. 
Peak controllers commonly use the output signal of a percussion track to control the volume of a sustained sound on a different track. 
This results in the sustained sound being chopped up in time with the percussion. 
In LMMS, when you add a Peak Controller it is visible in the Controller Rack, but it&#x27;s actually an <b>effect</b> applied to an FX-channel. 
If you click on the &quot;Controls&quot; button you&#x27;ll get a window telling you to use the FX-channel&#x27;s controls (magenta arrow). 
Therefore, to get to the Peak Controller settings, click the &quot;Controls&quot; button on the Peak controller entry in the Effects chain box (yellow arrow). 
Beware an FX-channel can have more than one Peak controller entry.

The Controller Rack displays all the controllers created within this project.

<h2>4.1 Safety</h2>As mentioned in General settings, the <b>Backup </b>feature is ON by default. 
It is highly recommended to keep it that way! You may also like to invoke the <b>Autosave</b> feature. 
Whereas a <em>.BAK</em> file represents the penultimate version of your work, Autosave will <em>create a copy</em> of the <em>current</em> file state.
Autosave will only be invoked when LMMS is <em>idle</em>, so it will not by default happen in replay or during export! You control the interval between each Autosave. 
Because an autosave results in a tiny drop in performance, you find the settings for using Autosave in Settings &gt; Performance. 
A choice of 5 - 15 mins is recommended. 
The default is 5 mins. 
If LMMS crashes it is very important that you pay attention to the screen next time you open LMMS! You will get 2 options from Autosave:
<b>Ignore:</b> anything Autosave has kept will be deleted!

<b>Recover:</b> LMMS will load the Autosave version of the last loaded project as a recover project! You need to use File &gt; Save as and rename the recovery file to a name of your own choice! Do that immidiately!

</ol>Remember to save often! Save your project every time you&#x27;ve created something that sounds great. 
It&#x27;s also a good strategy to save different versions of your song, allowing you to revert to a previous version of the project in the event that you&#x27;ve tweaked the production into something you don&#x27;t like.
LMMS provides a special version control option for this in the File menu: <em>Save as new version</em>. 
Let&#x27;s say your project was named as &quot;MyProject&quot;, the new version will be named &quot;MyProject-01&quot;, and the old file will not be altered.
When you save a project for the first time, you will be prompted for a folder and project name. 
You also have to choose if your project should be compressed (mmpz) or uncompressed (mmp). 
Subsequent saves will overwrite this file, and LMMS will show you a small message at the bottom of the screen.

Wait for the message, before you continue your work!

<h2>4.2 Jumping Right In</h2>A project is created by adding instruments (sidebar tab 1), samples (sidebar tab 3) and/or presets (sidebar tab 4) to either the Song-Editor or the Beat+Bassline-Editor. 
Each added element is in LMMS regarded as a <b>Track</b>.
In this way you can have instrument tracks based on presets, Beat+Bassline tracks and automation tracks.
The Song-Editor is useful for non-repeating sound events, such as melody lines, while the Beat+Bassline-Editor is useful for repeating sequences, like percussion.
Events created in the Beat+Bassline-Editor are &quot;continuous&quot;, i.e. 
they can&#x27;t be expanded (but can be copied, of course).
The actual song is always built in the Song-Editor. 
This is where all the <b>elements</b> (Song-Editor blocks), including events in the Beat+Bassline Editor, come together on the timeline forming the project.
When starting a new project in LMMS there are 4 items loaded in the Song Editor by default. 
The first one, named &quot;Default Preset&quot;, is an instance of the TripleOscillator (3-OSC) generator; it&#x27;s a good example of an instrument container. 
This TripleOscillator instance&#x27;s default settings generate sounds using waveforms, default it is simple sine waveform, but that you can change.
Let&#x27;s take a look at this instrument, because it has behavior that is the same for all other instrument containers. 
When you move your mouse over the instrument containers, they will highlight. 
This indicates that the instrument can be clicked as if they were buttons! Left-click the 3-OSC. 
This opens the instrument GUI. 
The 3-OSC instrument is now chosen, and it is at the same time the focused instrument. 
Click again, and the GUI will close. 
All instruments behave like this.
When you make changes on the GUI you create a preset. 
If it sounds less than horrible, you have an instrument-preset :) If you right-click you will have a rename option. 
<em>Always name your presets!</em> To the left of the instruments there are 2 clickable lights (). 
When the green light is ON, the track is activated. 
In its OFF state the track is muted. 
The other light is red. 
When it is ON, the track will mute all other tracks and play solo.
Next, to the left of these, we have the action-button (). 
Here you can delete or clone the track and all of its events. 
To the right of the Instruments, before the knobs, we have a vertical bar. 
When clicked, it will play the root note of the instrument. 
We also have a dial for volume and one for balance:

Volume and panning

In most great programs, there are always more than one way to do a specific task! This makes various workflows possible. 
This is also the case with LMMS. 
The volume dial we just looked at, is a good example. 
You can adjust volume with several different controls. 
In the main component we have the main sound settings, called the &quot;master volume&quot;.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiNOt2_vXcFf2iR465%2F-LuiNRTF4846iRlJQNc5%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=79cbf479-b6b0-4aef-9d64-3c5cc3b30044">

Master volume

You would really never change this setting for creative reasons. 
But if the phone rings... 
The same goes for master pitch. 
Creative changes in volume is best done in other controllers.
The volume dial on your instrument, that is suited for controlling the volume on a saved instrument preset.
The volume sliders in FX-Mixer are suited to set volume in a project. 
Remember that everything you like to save for general usage, that must be saved with the preset! This goes for the aforementioned volume, but also for effects added on the FX-Tab. 
Amazing FX chains that you build in the FX-Mixer will not be simple to use in a new project! If, however, it is made directly in an instrument preset, then it is natively usable in any project, as a saved instrument preset!
Planning and making good decisions can spare you a lot of fruitless redoing!
I will also recommend you to use the project notes. 
Write down your ideas, because it is next to given, that you will not remember where in the project you had that &quot;neat little phrase&quot;.
On the right half of the Song Editor, we have the timeline. 
Create a track by adding events to this timeline. 
The timeline is divided in bar-sized blocks. 
Click in one next to 3-OSC. 
You get a visually different &quot;box&quot;. 
If you double-click this box, you open the Piano-Roll Editor. 
This is where you compose. 
You can also right-click in the box and choose the context menu option <em>Open in Piano-Roll</em>. 
We will return to that later.
Below the 3-OSC you have the Sample Track. 
It is great for vocals or other larger WAV or OGG files that you want to replay unaltered, but can also be used as an advanced clip looper. 
You can add a new sample track with the 6. 
button on the Song Editor toolbar ().
Next you have the default Beat+Bassline instance. 
Just for illustration, click on one of the boxes in the timeline next to the Beat+Bassline track. 
You get a blue block. 
Click and drag its right end and it will expand. 
This is what I meant by Beat+Bassline events are &quot;continuous&quot;. 
When you did that with the 3-OSC, the block would not expand. 
You can add a new Beat+Bassline with the 5. 
button on the Song Editor toolbar ().
Last is an instance of the <b>Automation track</b>. 
This can give you advanced variations in real-time, and it is with automation that you can create nice subtle changes in the sound over several bars, known in trance and house music, or rhythmic repeated growls and effects for, say dubstep. 
How to do all this and how to use automation tracks is explained in Working with automation. 
You can add a new automation track with the 7. 
button on the Song Editor toolbar ().

<h2>4.3 Instruments: Samples &amp; Presets</h2>Now we take a look at those components that create sounds: samples and instrument presets. 
To insert one of the many factory pre-defined instrument presets into the Beat+Bassline Editor or Song Editor, click the 4. 
button in the sidebar. 
It works just like a browser. 
You can now choose a preset and drag it into the song editor. 
Everything that you can do in the sidebar browser with presets, you can also do with samples (just click the 3. 
button in the sidebar). 
Furthermore, you can click and hold your mouse on the name of a preset or sample. 
LMMS will then let you listen to that particular instrument, as a kind of sound test. 
You can then drag the instrument into the editor.

If you add VST instruments to your preset collection, you should <em>never</em> use this preview feature on these VST presets!

You can also double-click an instrument in the browser. 
This will place the objects directly into the Beat+Bassline Editor, or you can right-click on the instrument in the browser list tree, and LMMS will open a context menu. 
Here you have the option to send this instrument into an empty slot in the Song Editor or to replace a current active instrument with this new instrument. 
The active instrument is the one that is highlighted in the Song Editor, and has its GUI opened, in other words has been mouse-clicked.
Always use the send to active instrument option when ever you need to load a VST instrument preset (more on this: How to use VST instrument presets).
When you insert an instrument, the instrument&#x27;s GUI editor window will open. 
You can also see this GUI by clicking on the instruments grey name button in the Song or Beat+Bassline Editor. 
When you click the name button, it will change to lightgray. 
This instrument is now the active instrument. 
The name button acts as a toggle for the GUI editor window. 
Instrument GUI&#x27;s have five tabs: PLUGIN, ENV/LFO, FUNC, FX and MIDI. 
The PLUGIN tab changes with the type of instrument. 
All other tabs are standard for every instrument, however the ENV/LFO tab is only available on the kind of instruments that can use this feature. 
VeSTige, LB302 and ZynAddSubFX plugins do not present this tab. 
An in-depth explanation of how to use the features on the various tabs can be found in the Working with instruments section.
If you want to remove an instrument completely from your song, click on its gray toolkit icon and choose &quot;Remove this track&quot;.
Instruments are divided into factory provided and user specified. 
Subfolders in your file system can be used to organize the instruments or samples hierarchichally.
Later you may like to create your own instruments from scratch. 
The sidebar&#x27;s 1.button opens the instruments plugins. 
These are empty default preset templates that you can use for your own instruments. 
Drag them into your project and play around with all the settings on the GUI. 
Some hints and tips on how to create 3-OSC instruments can be found in Making TripleOscillator patches. 
You can of course also make changes to the factory-defined instruments and save those as your own. 
Overwriting existing factory-defined instrument is not recommended.

<h2>4.4 Creating a Track</h2>The standard way to create a track is to add percussion instruments to the Beat+Bassline Editor and instruments for melody tracks into the Song Editor. 
Then create different percussion loops using the <b>Add bassline</b> button in the Beat+Bassline Editor for each rhythmic element you want - a main bass line, a hihat line, special rhythms and breaks, etc. 
These are listed in the Song Editor as they&#x27;re created. 
To make them play, click on the start bar in the track&#x27;s timeline to create a new <b>block element</b> (segment). 
You can also drag in Beat+Bassline blocks to make the pattern go across multiple bars. 
The same technique can be used for repetitive bass lines, if you create them in the Beat+Bassline Editor.

Keyboard as piano

For melody tracks, click in the Song Editor on the bar where you want a new melody segment and then double-click that block element to open the Piano Roll Editor. 
Place your notes in the piano roll, by clicking on the notes wanted start &quot;position&quot; or <b>tick</b>, to create a new note, you can then drag the notes right-hand edge to be as long as you want. 
You can also drag notes up and down to change their pitch.
Alternatively, you can press the record button in the Piano Roll Editor and play notes in real time, either on the computer keyboard or a MIDI keyboard.
We recommend that you as next read and do the exercises in the section Your First Song with LMMS.

<h2>4.6 Using VSTs</h2>For this section, download and install the VST <b>Synth1</b>. 
You can find it here. 
When downloading other VSTs, you should try to download them from their official sites. 
However in VST Resources you can find several safe sites dedicated to hosting VSTs for download.
So why Synth1? It is our proof-of-concept VST.
When you download VSTs, unpack them in the folder you have entered as your default VST folder in the preferences of your LMMS installation.

VST-PLUGIN DIRECTORY is where LMMS will look for VSTs.
In Synth1&#x27;s case, it will need to be installed. 
This is not always the case with VSTs, but for the few that ask you to specify the installation folder, be sure to always use the same one. 
It is also recommended that you use a sub<em>-</em>folder structure for the various VSTs. 
This is especially important for VSTs that have their own banks and/or multiple files they require to run.
Let&#x27;s load one instance of Synth1. 
Normally you will load VSTs into already open projects, and it is important that you always save before loading VSTs.
In LMMS, click on the <em>Instrument plugins</em><b><em> </em></b>button on the left sidebar. 
This should open up a list of built in instruments. 
Loading from this list opens the instrument in its default state - something that is very important for successfully opening VSTs in LMMS,

Locate <b>VeSTige</b> in the list and drag it into your project

Open the instrument GUI, e.g. 
click on the instrument in the Song Editor

To the right of the text &quot;No VST Plugin loaded&quot; there is a folder symbol - click on it

Browse the VST folder

Click on the .dll and wait for LMMS to load the VST

</ol>When it loads, the VST&#x27;s GUI will open.

Be careful when opening/closing VST GUIs as it tends to freeze LMMS, so use &quot;Show/Hide&quot; button whenever you need to hide the GUI.

If you successfully loaded Synth1, you should now be able to use it in your project. 
You can also automate the dials and sliders in your VSTs. 
Directly below the folder icon there is a wrench icon. 
Clicking on it will show the interface for the VST&#x27;s controllers. 
You can Ctrl+drag any of these dials into an automation track or connect them to a controller.

In the save window that opened, create a new folder called &quot;VeSTige&quot; in the presets folder, located in your LMMS installation. 
You can then make sub-folders for specific VSTs if you&#x27;d like. 
This keeps things tidy and structured, but is completely optional.

</ol>Loading saved VST presets is just as easy:
<b>Remember to always save the project first!</b>

Load a new VeSTige plugin into the project, from sidebar

Open the VeSTige GUI

<h2>4.5 Exporting a Song</h2>There are many factors to consider when exporting a finished song, such as computer processor, amount of memory and the quality level desired. 
Then matching those up to each and every option given for the export, the more processor power and memory the computer has the smoother the process will be and the more options can be chosen at higher levels, but will increase the time it takes to export the song. 
There will be no fast easy rule for exporting, but to take the best guess and try it. 
If it does not come out sounding the way it was intended, then delete the finished export, change the settings and try again. 
The export does not alter or damage the original .mmpz file, it is only reading as in the case of say ripping from a CD to computer. 
So keep adjusting the settings until it comes out the way it was intended to sound during the creation. 
The good news is that it will only take a few trial and error exports to figure out what any particular computer build can handle. 
Not taking the time on the export and winging it is like missing a note in a song or when playing an instrument, it just does not sound right. 
The same holds true for the export, take the time here and the outcome will be what it needs to be, as it sounded during playback, but better.
It is highly recommended that you upgrade your LMMS installation to the newest release.
<h2>4.5.1 Exporting a Song</h2>
There are two ways to get to the export utility. 
You could either click on the export button (), or go to Project &gt; Export (Ctrl+E). 
After this choose the name for the song and a location to save to.
Following this there will be the Export Project window. 
This window displays all the export options that can be used to adjust the quality and precision of the exported song file.
<h2>4.5.2 File Format</h2>
There are two options:

<b>WAV</b> or waveform audio format is usually the best choice for newer users because it can be read on most computers and media devices without conversion

<b>OGG</b> vorbis format is a preferred choice for those who are particular about sound quality, however this format is limited in what devices it can be played on

<h2>4.5.3 Sample Rate</h2>
This option allows you to adjust how many times the song will be sampled per second. 
The more times the song is sampled per second the more sensitive the exporter will be to changes in the song. 
In other words, if you have a lot of changes over a short amount of time you will want a higher sample rate. 
In general this should be left as it is. 
44.1kHz is what normal CD&#x27;s use. 
If the sample rate is turned down too much, the song will not sound properly and you might get aliasing. 
On the other hand, high sample rates will make the song file become extremely large and take much longer when being processed by the exporting tool.
<h2>4.5.4 Bit Rate</h2>
Bit rate refers to the amount (speed) at which the song is processed by the device reading it. 
<b>Number of bits per second.</b> This option is important because it allows choosing both quality and size of the song file. 
The higher the bit rate the better the quality of the music. 
However, it also means a larger file. 
The following list gives comparable examples of bit rates:
<table><tbody><tr><td data-table="cell">Bit rate
</td><td data-table="cell">Application example
</td></tr><tr><td data-table="cell">64 kbps

<h2>4.5.5 Bit Depth</h2>

<img src="https://lmms.io/wiki/images/f/fd/3bit_wave.PNG">

Bit depth = 3 graph example

<h2>4.5.5.1 Musical Approach</h2>
Bit depth is the number of different volumes a sound in the song can have. 
If the song is 3 bits, it has 2^3=8 volume levels in total. 
We say it has a bit depth resolution of eight. 
It is well known that a wave must go both up and down - have both crests and troughs - and is symmetrical around the X axis, therefore you must divide 8 by 2 to actually get the volume levels of the sound waves you hear. 
So the total calculated levels must be divided by 2 to get the levels you can hear. 
As you can see from the graph, there are only four volume levels above or below the X axis. 
The weakest sound possible with bit depth equal to 3 would be therefore a wave with amplitude of 1. 
The loudest possible sound is represented in the image with an amplitude of 4. 
Dynamic range is connected to bit depth.
<h2>4.5.5.2 Computer Science Approach</h2>
A way the processor in the computer interacts with the program in terms of scientific notation or integer format while the song is being encoded. 
Choosing the 32 bit float will allow the computer to do a more accurate compilation of the song, however it requires more processing power to achieve this. 
Using the 16 bit integer will allow for faster processing, especially on older or under-powered computers. 
In general to achieve a better sounding song, this setting should be set to 32 bit float.
<h2>4.5.6 Interpolation</h2>
Interpolation means the same as regression. 
Draw the sound waves smoothly. 
When LMMS gets the sample points it can choose to draw a line between two points, or it could try to draw smooth curves with smart algorithms. 
Analog sounds have smooth curves, and thus logically present the best sound. 
If you want the best result, always use the &quot;sinc best&quot; option. 
The audio file size is not affected by this option.

4.5.1 Exporting a Song

There are two ways to get to the export utility. 
You could either click on the export button (

), or go to Project \u003e Export (Ctrl+E). 
After this choose the name for the song and a location to save to.

Following this there will be the Export Project window. 
This window displays all the export options that can be used to adjust the quality and precision of the exported song file.

4.5.2 File Format

There are two options:

 
 
4.5.3 Sample Rate

This option allows you to adjust how many times the song will be sampled per second. 
The more times the song is sampled per second the more sensitive the exporter will be to changes in the song. 
In other words, if you have a lot of changes over a short amount of time you will want a higher sample rate. 
In general this should be left as it is.

<h2>4.6 Your First Song with LMMS</h2><h2>4.6.1 Your First Melody</h2>
<h2>4.6.1.1 Choosing the Instrument</h2>
You&#x27;ve got the default screen in front of you, with the Song Editor, Beat+Bassline Editor and Project Notes open. 
First, click the Presets icon () on the Sidebar to open up the list of preset sounds. 
Double-click on the TripleOscillator or click on the plus symbol on its left to open this folder and you will be presented with a diverse range of instruments. 
You can hold the mouse button down on any preset to hear a preview of its sound.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiVg_A4R9epYpgcP6o%2F-LuiVqG5KojlsEM5ljVb%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=cae44514-d6fd-422b-8621-5d3e3fb95e56">

My Presets

For now, let&#x27;s drag the &quot;Xylophon&quot; preset into the space in the middle of the Song Editor. 
When you drop it, a new track will be created with that preset as the instrument.

<img src="https://lmms.io/wiki/images/d/dc/Drag_and_drop_preset_1.0.0.PNG">

Dragging a preset

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiVtWT3lpYH9FHPXvV%2F-LuiW5_K9wC0UHbkxLBR%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=6d989ac7-68ac-4df3-bbe2-7d3c9dbc1224">

Xylophon dragged

If this were a percussion-type instrument, we might be better off dragging it to the Beat+Bassline Editor instead; you&#x27;ll see why in a second. 
We really want to give this instrument a string of notes (or a Piano Roll) to play, though, so Song Editor it is.

<h2>4.6.1.2 Making the Melody</h2>
We now want to add notes to make the melody. 
Left-click in the first bar of the Xylophon track and a new piano roll segment will appear (). 
Double-click on that and the Piano Roll Editor will appear, allowing you to put notes into that newly-created segment.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiW9nP0TfFnNQ8kKTE%2F-LuiWVSK5ItlNTnW7V9J%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=5e32b61a-863d-439b-89a7-68a080e6bb95">

Piano Roll Editor

<h3>4.6.1.2.1 The First Note
</h3>Now click in the black square just to the right of the &quot;A4&quot; note (which is three lines, or semitones, down from the note marked &quot;C5&quot;). 
This will create a new crotchet, a note one beat long, starting at that time.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiWYdTBnxy4uOrBuRn%2F-LuiWcm6v0uYtq_Y7KFB%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=f64ea86b-aaa6-4149-aa27-c2d8c2919e61">

The first note

However, this is too long: we need notes half a bear - a quarter - long. 
To change this, we simply move the mouse pointer to the right-hand edge of the note, until the cursor changes into a left-and-right arrow. 
Then we hold the mouse button down and drag the end of the note left two &quot;blocks&quot; (each block being 1/16 of a bar).

<img src="https://lmms.io/wiki/images/2/23/Resizing_notes_1.0.0.PNG">

Resizing notes

After this, the new notes we put down will be the same length, because the Piano Roll Editor is by default set to Last Note (). 
You can change this in the drop-down. 
However most of the time you will work with the &quot;Las Note&quot; setting, but if you suddenly create notes in the length you expected, it&#x27;s because you accidentally made a change to this drop-down.
<h3>4.6.1.2.2 More Notes
</h3>Continue creating notes in the pattern shown:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lui_IKqFc8ccEwy9F1X%2F-Lui_qnQWqBFxrJkMHDh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=cd8c2a71-1c72-41f8-bce3-28026d0cf937">

Popcorn pattern

To place a note, you need to aim for the line at the start of the bear; LMMS will recognize a small fraction of the area left of the beat line as being closer to that beat than the previous. 
You can control this with the &quot;Q setting&quot;. 
Default Q is correlated to note-length. 
That is &quot;Note lock&quot;. 
But again you can change that &quot;magnetic point&quot; in the Q-drop-down. 
If you make a mistake placing a note, you can move it to its correct position by clicking on the middle of the note (where the cursor turns into a four-way cross) and dragging the note to its new position. 
LMMS will play the note that you&#x27;re dragging onto as an aide to correct placement. 
You can move notes horizontally (in time) as well as vertically (in pitch).
If you need to delete a note, simply right-click on it.
<h3>4.6.1.2.3 Copy and Paste
</h3>We now want to repeat those seven notes at the start of the bar in the next bar. 
There are three ways to do this.

The first and worst way to do it is to simply click the correct notes. 
This is tedious.

The first real way to do it is to use the duplicator tool. 
First select the notes you want to copy. 
Hold down Ctrl and make a selection rectangle around the notes you want to copy. 
Next, hold Shift and drag the newly selected notes. 
You are now dragging a copy of the selected notes. 
You can place these where you want them to go.

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Lui_vxt8EhhlZ_RJRmB%2F-Lui_zumRHWCWJjrP22A%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=cfbdd643-ed87-449d-9d44-71f63a1666fa">

Duplicated notes

Alternatively, you can use good old copy and paste. 
Again, use Ctrl to select the notes you want, and then press Ctrl+C. 
Press Ctrl+V to paste the notes at the beginning, and move them to their new location.

To select all notes you can press Ctrl+A.
We can now press the <b>play</b> button () in the Piano Roll Editor window to play the melody back. 
When it gets to the end of the last bar in which there are notes, it will automatically repeat back to the start of the first bar.
Oops!
When we play the melody so far, we realize that the melody actually starts on the wrong beat. 
The second A4 note is really supposed to be the start of the bar, and the two notes before it are leading in from the previous bar. 
However, we can&#x27;t go further back than bar 1 in our piano roll. 
We need to move all the notes forward. 
Press Ctrl+A to select all the notes. 
Then you can click and drag to move them all over in order to have the first note start on the right beat (see picture below).
Now we need to avoid another and far more annoying Oops: loosing everything you made! Now you have made something that actually sounds great, it is high time for saving your project!
The first time you save, LMMS will prompt you for a projec6t name. 
That&#x27;s entirely up to you, but LMMS also lets you decide whether your project should be compressed (.mmpz), or kept as uncompressed XML (.mmp). 
Make your choice and save your project now!
Observe the message in the bottom of your screen!
Make sure you <em>always</em> see this message, every time you save your project, and if you end your work, and close LMMS, I recommend that you wait about 10 seconds, after you have saved the last time, before you close the program. 
You could also take a peek on your disk, and actually make sure that the project has been saved, has a believable size, and a correct time-stamp. 
But only when you close LMMS.
<h3>4.6.1.2.4 The First Four Bars
</h3>If you&#x27;re confident, you can now continue adding the notes of the tune to make the first four bars (up to where the main melody repeats). 
Here&#x27;s what your piano roll should look like at the end of this:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiaFWVqLVCr0SKSeh6%2F-LuiaOCY63OiTjejdHr-%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=61425019-3d9b-40a8-af2d-6715b64bf1ea">

Popcorn melody

<h2>4.6.1.3 More Structure</h2>
We can now close the Piano Roll Editor and go back to the Song Editor. 
You will see that the track segment we initially double-clicked to create the melody has expanded out to fit the notes that we&#x27;ve added.
We now want to copy that segment to create the next four bars. 
The easiest way to do that is to simply hold down the Ctrl key, then drag the initial segment. 
This will drag a copy of the segment to a new location, which must be outside the initial segment. 
This process will look like this:

<img src="https://lmms.io/wiki/images/0/01/Copying_segments_1.0.0.PNG">

Copying segments

Drop the segment on bar 6. 
This is actually one bar too late, as the first three quarters of a bar of this segment are empty, as is the last quarter of the last segment. 
Fortunately, segments can overlap and their notes will play simultaneously.

You should avoid having segments overlap as there is no clear display of how many segments overlap in a particular area. 
A small segment might completely disappear behind a large one, leaving you confused as to where those extra notes were coming from

Drag the second copy so that it starts at bar 5.
You can now play this using the play button in the Song Editor. 
You will hear a short pause as it counts the first three beats of silence, then the melody will start. 
It should play smoothly through the two repeats.
The Song Editor should now look like this:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiZnn4Fz5CxlVJ1ScT%2F-Lui_9RYb6aW4CzLptC-%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=3d89eca2-19f4-4784-a375-96801fe5be58">

How the Song Editor should look like

<h2>4.6.1.4 Variation 2</h2>
We can now go on to create another piano roll segment and fill in the next four bars:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiaSJe5iG1jPU51gcH%2F-LuiadH2N99onKW2T9_K%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=f8a0e375-019a-40d1-be2d-44c0299e6194">

Melody variation

Due to the way that the segments overlap, you will have to create the new segment in a new bar, e.g. 
bar 11, and then move it into position over the previous segment.
Note that there is a slight oddity in the Piano Roll Editor that causes you to start editing at bar 2 when opening occasional new segments. 
Check which bar you&#x27;re writing notes into before getting too far!
Your Song Editor should now look like this:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-Luiah3xwLg2o0UDvIdk%2F-LuiasdXjGtN21CQJLxW%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=0a45dc2d-00ed-48e9-a537-875b470edaa0">

Final Song Editor look

<h2>4.6.2 Your First Beat</h2>
For our first beat we are going to click the my samples button on the Sidebar (). 
This is your sample collection that comes standard with LMMS. 
On the list of folders that appeared, one of them labeled &quot;drums&quot;. 
Double-clicking the folder will show a list of percussion instruments. 
Click on them to hear the different sounds of the instruments.
If you look at the open windows one of them should read Beat+Bassline Editor. 
Locate that box before going forward. 
If you have closed it by chance it is located on the left top toolbar.
Going back to the samples you just heard select a <b>Kick drum </b>(any will work). 
Double-click the sample and it should appear in the Beat+Bassline Editor. 
Also add a <b>Closed HiHat</b> and a <b>Snare</b>. 
You will end up with 3 instruments in the Beat+Bassline Editor. 
You can make drum patterns by clicking the grey squares (). 
You can play your drum patter by pressing the <b>play</b> button (). 
The pattern will loop until you stop it.
Here are some example drum patterns that you could use in your projects:
<h2>4.6.2.1 Drum Patterns</h2>

Here we only looked at simple &quot;notes&quot; added directly in BB Editor. 
But you should also read the section Composing Bass Lines and Drum Sequences, where more advanced methods are explained. 
You will learn how to alter quantizing and humanize in piano roll.
<h2>4.6.3 Good Song! Bad result.</h2>
You are not there yet!
One of the most common problems is sound-clipping and nasty artifacts. 
One of those make the song sound like it comes from a tin bucket. 
Sometimes distortion will feel like really unpleasant hearing irritation, and your first impulse is to look for a volume control.
Your next job is to make sure you do not have that! This part of the process is at least as important as the previous ones.
Take a look at the mixer. 
You can see that all channels have their own dB meter. 
The first thing you need is to make sure that no meter, including master is (constantly) in the red area. 
When a sound-intensity causes the meter to go &quot;into the red&quot;, you will get distortions, and really bad sound, well, in fact even risk of damage to speakers, and worse - your ears!
I choose the phrase <em>constantly</em>. 
I did that because it is acceptable that your meter occasionally touches in the red, but it&#x27;s a fine art to know when touching is more like groping.
If you have clipping, you can deal with it in a lot of different ways. 
You can find much more about tools as limiters and compressors in the more specialized chapters of the wiki.
You can also watch the mixing video tutorials and learn much more about the power of the LMMS mixer.
Right now, you can try to just change the volume sliders and get rid of the red-clippings. 
Then listen to your track again. 
You should be able to hear the difference. 
The instruments should be cleaner and stand better individually in the total mix.

4.6.1.1 Choosing the Instrument

You've got the default screen in front of you, with the Song Editor, Beat+Bassline Editor and Project Notes open. 
First, click the Presets icon (

) on the Sidebar to open up the list of preset sounds. 
Double-click on the TripleOscillator or click on the plus symbol on its left to open this folder and you will be presented with a diverse range of instruments. 
You can hold the mouse button down on any preset to hear a preview of its sound.

For now, let's drag the \"Xylophon\" preset into the space in the middle of the Song Editor. 
When you drop it, a new track will be created with that preset as the instrument.

4.6.1.2 Making the Melody

We now want to add notes to make the melody. 
Left-click in the first bar of the Xylophon track and a new piano roll segment will appear (

). 
Double-click on that and the Piano Roll Editor will appear, allowing you to put notes into that newly-created segment.

4.6.1.2.1 The First Note

Now click in the black square just to the right of the \"A4\" note (which is three lines, or semitones, down from the note marked \"C5\"). 
This will create a new crotchet, a note one beat long, starting at that time.

However, this is too long: we need notes half a bear - a quarter - long. 
To change this, we simply move the mouse pointer to the right-hand edge of the note, until the cursor changes into a left-and-right arrow. 
Then we hold the mouse button down and drag the end of the note left two \"blocks\" (each block being 1/16 of a bar).

After this, the new notes we put down will be the same length, because the Piano Roll Editor is by default set to Last Note (

). 
You can change this in the drop-down. 
However most of the time you will work with the \"Las Note\" setting, but if you suddenly create notes in the length you expected, it's because you accidentally made a change to this drop-down.

4.6.1.2.2 More Notes

Continue creating notes in the pattern shown:

To place a note, you need to aim for the line at the start of the bear; LMMS will recognize a small fraction of the area left of the beat line as being closer to that beat than the previous. 
You can control this with the \"Q setting\". 
Default Q is correlated to note-length. 
That is \"Note lock\". 
But again you can change that \"magnetic point\" in the Q-drop-down. 
If you make a mistake placing a note, you can move it to its correct position by clicking on the middle of the note (where the cursor turns into a four-way cross) and dragging the note to its new position. 
LMMS will play the note that you're dragging onto as an aide to correct placement. 
You can move notes horizontally (in time) as well as vertically (in pitch).

If you need to delete a note, simply right-click on it.

4.6.1.2.3 Copy and Paste

We now want to repeat those seven notes at the start of the bar in the next bar. 
There are three ways to do this.

 

To select all notes you can press Ctrl+A.

We can now press the 
play button (

) in the Piano Roll Editor window to play the melody back. 
When it gets to the end of the last bar in which there are notes, it will automatically repeat back to the start of the first bar.

Oops!

When we play the melody so far, we realize that the melody actually starts on the wrong beat. 
The second A4 note is really supposed to be the start of the bar, and the two notes before it are leading in from the previous bar. 
However, we can't go further back than bar 1 in our piano roll. 
We need to move all the notes forward. 
Press Ctrl+A to select all the notes. 
Then you can click and drag to move them all over in order to have the first note start on the right beat (see picture below).

Now we need to avoid another and far more annoying Oops: loosing everything you made! Now you have made something that actually sounds great, it is high time for saving your project!

The first time you save, LMMS will prompt you for a projec6t name. 
That's entirely up to you, but LMMS also lets you decide whether your project should be compressed (.mmpz), or kept as uncompressed XML (.mmp). 
Make your choice and save your project now!

Observe the message in the bottom of your screen!

Make sure you 
always see this message, every time you save your project, and if you end your work, and close LMMS, I recommend that you wait about 10 seconds, after you have saved the last time, before you close the program. 
You could also take a peek on your disk, and actually make sure that the project has been saved, has a believable size, and a correct time-stamp. 
But only when you close LMMS.

4.6.1.2.4 The First Four Bars

If you're confident, you can now continue adding the notes of the tune to make the first four bars (up to where the main melody repeats). 
Here's what your piano roll should look like at the end of this:

4.6.1.3 More Structure

We can now close the Piano Roll Editor and go back to the Song Editor. 
You will see that the track segment we initially double-clicked to create the melody has expanded out to fit the notes that we've added.

We now want to copy that segment to create the next four bars. 
The easiest way to do that is to simply hold down the Ctrl key, then drag the initial segment. 
This will drag a copy of the segment to a new location, which must be outside the initial segment. 
This process will look like this:

Drop the segment on bar 6. 
This is actually one bar too late, as the first three quarters of a bar of this segment are empty, as is the last quarter of the last segment. 
Fortunately, segments can overlap and their notes will play simultaneously.

Drag the second copy so that it starts at bar 5.

You can now play this using the play button in the Song Editor. 
You will hear a short pause as it counts the first three beats of silence, then the melody will start. 
It should play smoothly through the two repeats.

The Song Editor should now look like this:

4.6.1.4 Variation 2

We can now go on to create another piano roll segment and fill in the next four bars:

Due to the way that the segments overlap, you will have to create the new segment in a new bar, e.g. 
bar 11, and then move it into position over the previous segment.

Note that there is a slight oddity in the Piano Roll Editor that causes you to start editing at bar 2 when opening occasional new segments. 
Check which bar you're writing notes into before getting too far!

Your Song Editor should now look like this:

4.6.2 Your First Beat

For our first beat we are going to click the my samples button on the Sidebar (

). 
This is your sample collection that comes standard with LMMS. 
On the list of folders that appeared, one of them labeled \"drums\". 
Double-clicking the folder will show a list of percussion instruments. 
Click on them to hear the different sounds of the instruments.

If you look at the open windows one of them should read Beat+Bassline Editor. 
Locate that box before going forward. 
If you have closed it by chance it is located on the left top toolbar.

Going back to the samples you just heard select a 
Kick drum 
(any will work). 
Double-click the sample and it should appear in the Beat+Bassline Editor. 
Also add a 
Closed HiHat and a 
Snare
. 
You will end up with 3 instruments in the Beat+Bassline Editor. 
You can make drum patterns by clicking the grey squares (

). 
You can play your drum patter by pressing the 
play button (

). 
The pattern will loop until you stop it.

Here are some example drum patterns that you could use in your projects:

4.6.2.1 Drum Patterns

4.6.2.1.1 Four on the Floor

Standard beat pattern commonly used in Disco, House and Techno songs.

4.6.2.1.2 Amen Break

This drum solo was originally performed by Gregory Sylvester Coleman, but has been heavily sampled and pitched up for use in jump-up drum and bass and jungle.

4.6.2.1.3 Typical Beakbeat

By moving the Bass drum out of the regular 4/4 timing we create a \"Breakbeat\".

4.6.2.1.4 Prodigy - Smack My B**** up

Breakbeat intro.

4.6.2.1.5 Prodigy - Main Beat

Note the lowered volumes of the snare drum in the 2 examples above, i.e. 
the dimmed lights in some steps. 
To change the volume of a step, hover your mouse over it and roll the scroll wheel down to lower volume and up to raise volume. 
The brightness of the step will change.

4.6.3 Good Song! Bad result.

You are not there yet!

One of the most common problems is sound-clipping and nasty artifacts. 
One of those make the song sound like it comes from a tin bucket. 
Sometimes distortion will feel like really unpleasant hearing irritation, and your first impulse is to look for a volume control.

Your next job is to make sure you do not have that! This part of the process is at least as important as the previous ones.

Take a look at the mixer. 
You can see that all channels have their own dB meter. 
The first thing you need is to make sure that no meter, including master is (constantly) in the red area. 
When a sound-intensity causes the meter to go \"into the red\", you will get distortions, and really bad sound, well, in fact even risk of damage to speakers, and worse - your ears!

I choose the phrase 
constantly
. 
I did that because it is acceptable that your meter occasionally touches in the red, but it's a fine art to know when touching is more like groping.

If you have clipping, you can deal with it in a lot of different ways. 
You can find much more about tools as limiters and compressors in the more specialized chapters of the wiki.

You can also watch the mixing video tutorials and learn much more about the power of the LMMS mixer.

<h2>5.1 AudioFileProcessor</h2>The AudioFileProcessor plugin is used to play back uncompressed or compressed samples in an instrument. 
It looks like this:

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LuiOjQ88b6BGaUiE8ef%2F-LuiOsTzH2RBK5U3ASuN%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=61dcfead-abda-45ab-a1eb-6ea0f5004149">

AudioFileProcessor

The <b>amplitude</b> for playback of the wave file, in percentage of the original. 
You can go above 100% if your wave file is quiet and you want to make it louder. 
If the master volume or the volume of the instrument or track is low enough you won&#x27;t cause any clipping, because of the way the audio signal is processed in LMMS, naturally, you can also quiet a sound down by using percentages less than 100%. 
However, this won&#x27;t correct clipping that was present in the original file.

The <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> of playback of the sample can be used if you only want to play back a specific part of a sample.

The reversed R controls the <b>direction</b> of playback. 
When inactive, the sample is played forward; when active, the sample is played in reverse.

The cyclic arrows control whether the sample is <b>repeated</b> from the beginning once it reaches the end (or vice versa for reversed playback) if the note is still held down and playback has progressed all the way through the file.

The icon with two bars and a marker enables stutter-mode. 
In this mode, sample playback is always started from the point where it last ended. 
You can reset the position back to the beginning by playing a very low note, one that is below 20hz in frequency.

The folder icon allows you to choose a <b>new file</b> from a file open dialog. 
You can also change the current sample by dragging a sample from the Samples section of the Side Bar.

Monstro

<h2>5.8.1 Main Views</h2>
Monstro is divided in two main views: Operators and Matrix. 
Operators view contains all sound generators: oscillators 1-3, and additionally two modulators: LFOs 1-2, Envelopes 1-2. 
Matrix view contains the modulation matrix: it has knobs that control how the modulators affect the generators.
<h2>5.8.2 Operator View</h2>
<h2>5.8.2.1 Generators</h2>
Oscillator 1 is the pulse wave oscillator. 
Note that it&#x27;s a naive pulse wave and is not band-limited. 
It has 7 knobs:

Volume and panning

CRS: controls the coarse tuning, in semitone steps

FTL and FTR: control the fine-tuning for left and right channels, respectively. 
The units are cents (1/100 of a semitone).

SPO (stereo phase offset): phase difference between left and right channels

PW (pulse width): aka duty cycle, control the &quot;shape&quot; of the pulse wave. 
At 50%, the wave is a perfect square wave. 
Adjusting the knob to either direction makes the pulse more rectangular.

Additionally Osc1 contains a &quot;sync send&quot; mechanism. 
This controls when the Osc1 sends sync signals. 
You can set it to send sync signals either on the rise, fall or both of the pulse. 
Rise refers to when off-state changes to on-state, fall is the opposite. 
Changing the pulse width, phase, FTL/FTR or pitch affects the timing of these signals, but changing the volume or panning does not. 
Sync mechanisms are elaborated below.
Oscillator 2 is a regular oscillator. 
It can generate any of a selection of predefined waveforms, some of which are band-limited, others not. 
It can also generate white noise. 
It contains 6 knobs: Volume, panning, CRS, FTL, FTR, SPO. 
They work the same as above.
Additionally Osc2 contains a sync mechanism. 
This can be used to sync Osc2 with the sync signals sent by Osc1. 
There&#x27;s two sync modes, which can be used separately or combined:

<b>Hard sync</b> resets the phase at every sync signal, meaning the waveform starts again from the &quot;beginning&quot;

<b>Reverse syn</b> inverts the waveform&#x27;s polarity at every sync signal, meaning that +1.0 amplitude becomes -1.0 and vice versa

Oscillator 3 is a regular oscillator. 
It is the same as Osc2, except for one difference: it has no FTL/FTR knobs, but instead has a SUB knob, and two waveform selectors. 
The SUB knob interpolates (mixes) linearly between the two waveforms selected. 
The waveforms themselves are the same as on Osc2. 
Osc3 also contains the same sync mechanism as Osc2, which works the same way.
Additionally, in the bottom right corner, there&#x27;s a modulation mode switch, which controls the relationship between Osc2 and Osc3. 
The modes are:

Mix: Osc2 and Osc3 are mixed together

AM: Osc2 modulates the amplitude (volume) of Osc3

FM: Osc2 modulates the frequency (pitch) of Osc3 (implemented as phase modulation to prevent pitch drift)

PM: Osc2 modulates the phase of Osc3

If the mode is any other than Mix, Osc2 will be inaudible and only affects the output of Osc3.
<h2>5.8.2.2 Modulators</h2>
LFO is short for &quot;Low Frequency Oscillator&quot;. 
Both LFO1 and LFO2 work the same way. 
They are always inaudible and only affect the generators. 
Each contains 3 knobs:

<b>Rate</b> knob controls the speed (frequency) of the LFO. 
The units are milliseconds, signifying the length of the cycle. 
You can convert this to Hz by the formula: Hz = 1 / ( Rate / 1000 )

<b>Att</b> controls the attack length of the LFO. 
Basically, adding more attack makes the LFO start working gradually instead of instantly.

<b>Phs</b> controls the phase of the LFO. 
Does not affect <b>Random</b> or <b>Random Smooth</b> modes.

Each LFO has a selection of waveforms. 
Note that none of these are band-limited. 
They&#x27;re the same as the non-band-limited waveforms on the regular oscillators, except for two differences: Random and Random Smooth.
Random works as a shaped noise: the LFO generates a random value that changes once per cycle (defined by the Rate knob).
Random Smooth is the same, except that the value of the LFO changes smoothly between the random values - they&#x27;re interpolated with cosinus interpolation, which means each transition between values is shaped like half of a sine wave.
Envelopes have 7 knobs:

<b>PRE</b> controls the pre-delay before the envelope

<b>ATT</b> controls the length of attack - the phase where the envelope goes up from 0 to 1

<b>HOLD</b> controls the length of time the envelope stays at 1

<b>DEC</b> controls the length of the decay phase (going from 1 to 0). 
However, if sustain is bigger than 0, the actual decay phase will be cut short.

<b>SUS</b> controls the sustain level, on which the envelope stays in the decay phase when a note is held

<b>REL</b> controls the length of the release phase, again expressed as the length of time from 1 to 0. 
However, if sustain is lower than 1, the actual release will be shorter

<b>SLOPE</b> controls the shape of the envelope slopes (attack, decay and release). 
Negative amounts will curve the slopes of the envelope downwards, while positive amounts curve them upwards.

<h2>5.8.3 Matrix View</h2>
The Matrix view contains 11 modulation targets, each of which can be modulated by any or all of the 4 modulators.
All of the 3 oscillators have these modulation targets:

<b>Volume:</b> Envelopes controlling volume are a special case. 
With volume envelopes, the modulation is always multiplicative: envelopes will never make the volume higher than what it is originally. 
Volume envelopes are normalized so that the peak part of the envelope is inverted so that attack starts from original volume and slopes downwards. 
LFOs work on volume relatively - a modulation value of 0.5 modulates between 50% and 150% of the original volume. 
Negative values invert the LFO.

<b>Phase:</b> The maximum difference on both envelopes and LFOs is 360°. 
Envelopes on phase always start from +0° phase offset and go either up or down, depending on the modulation value. 
LFOs oscillate between negative and positive phase offset, but the range is the same: at maximum modulation value, they oscillate between -180° and +180°.

<b>Pitch:</b> The maximum range for both envelopes and LFOs is 2 octaves. 
The scale is logarithmic, so 0.5 represents 1 octave, 0.25 is 6 semitones, etc. 
The pitch is capped with minimum and maximum values, which are 18Hz and 48kHz respectively. 
If the envelope/LFO would go beyond these values, it gets clipped.

Additionally, oscillators 1 and 3 each have an extra modulation target:

<b>Osc1 PW:</b> The pulse width (duty cycle) of oscillator 1. 
The maximum range for both is 100 percentage points, so an envelope can go from +0 to either +100pp, or -100pp with a negative modulation value, and an LFO can oscillate between -50pp and +50pp. 
The modulation is obviously capped at the min/max values of the PW knob (0% and 100%).

<b>Osc3 SUB </b>controls the mixing between the two waveforms. 
This works the same way as the above.

<h2>5.8.4 Tips</h2>
Monstro is a complex synth, so it can at some settings use a lot of CPU power. 
The more modulators you use, the higher the CPU usage. 
If you set any modulator in the matrix to other than 0, it gets calculated, and this consumes more CPU power.
Similarly, the FM, AM and PM modes consume slightly more CPU than the Mix mode, as they require additional calculations.

<h2>5.10.1 Operators</h2>
The two oscillators are called operators. 
In FM mode (bottom left), operator 1 modulates operator 2. 
Otherwise both operators are routed to the output.
<h2>5.10.2 Controls</h2>
For each operator, the controls are:

<b>ATT, DEC, SUS, REL:</b> an ADSR envelope

<b>KSR:</b> keyboard scaling rate. 
When KSR is on, envelopes get faster when the pitch rises.

<b>PERC:</b> percussive envelope. 
Makes the envelope go straight to release ignoring held keys.

<b>TREM:</b> applies tremolo (slight amplitude modulation) to the operator

<b>VIB:</b> applies vibrato (slight pitch modulation) to the operator

<b>FEEDBACK:</b> only for operator 1 - feeds a portion of the operator&#x27;s output back into ir

<b>LVL:</b> the output level of the operator

<b>SCALE:</b> determines the scaling applied to the output level when the pitch rises

<b>MUL:</b> the frequency multiplier for the operator. 
1 stands for the standard pitch played on the keyboard, 0 is one octave below.

<b>WAVEFORM: </b>selection from 4 waveforms: sine, half sine, absolute sine and quarter sine. 
NB: a DC removal plugin might be a good idea when routing waveforms other than sine to the output.

<h2>5.10.2.1 Global Controls</h2>
<b>FM: </b>when this is on, frequency modulation is used. 
Otherwise the operators are mixed together.

<b>DEPTH, TREM and VIBR: </b>these select deeper tremolo and vibrato. 
Applies to both operators.

Organic

Although it has more oscillators than TripleOscillator, it is less flexible because it lacks a lot of its abilities, among them the option to modulate the oscillators with each other. 
The phase offsets of each oscillator are randomized whenever a note is played (for both stereo channels separately). 
For that reason this instrument sounds slightly different everytime you press a key even when you don&#x27;t change any settings.
Organic is most useful for creating organ instruments (that&#x27;s where its name comes from) and pads.
<h2>5.11.1 Individual Oscillator Controls</h2>
<b>Wave: </b>The waveform generated by the oscillator

0%: Sine

1%: Sawtooth

2%: Pulse

3%: Triangle

4%: Moog Triangle

5%: Exponential

<b>Vol:</b> Volume of the oscillator

<b>Pan:</b> Stereo panning of the oscillator

<b>Wide:</b> Coarse of the oscillator. 
Has a range of one octave up and down.

<h2>5.11.2 General Controls</h2>
<b>Dist:</b> Adds a clipper effect (distortion)

<b>Vol:</b> General volume

<b>Randomize:</b> Randomizes all oscillator settings

GUS patches are patches associated with Gravis Ultrasound soundcards. 
Their concept is very similar to SoundFont and they can be considered SoundFont predecessors.
Patman is a simple patch loader. 
It also allows looping of the patch. 
There aren&#x27;t many patches online, but you can find a pretty good collection here.

Sf2 Player

There are no SoundFonts included in LMMS, but you can find a lot of SoundFonts on the internet, see 8.3 SoundFont resources. 
A SoundFont bank contains base samples in PCM format (similar to WAV files) that are mapped to sections on a musical keyboard. 
This is especially useful for people working with MIDI files, since most SoundFonts contain samples of real instruments. 
You can select the default SoundFont that will be used when loading MIDI files in the Settings.
Many SoundFonts have multiple patches which is multiple sounds, often different instruments or different styles of instruments. 
To select a patch you can use the patch and bank spinners, or click on the wrench icon to open a window where you can see all banks and patches.
Because the Sf2 Player is a MIDI bases instrument, you can&#x27;t use ENV/LFO in it. 
This tab is intentionally left empty. 
You can also apply Reverb and Chorus directly in the plugin.
Some SoundFont files support reverb and chorus. 
SF2 player gives four knobs for controlling the effects:

Reverb

The <b>Size</b> knob lets you select the room size for the reverb

The <b>Damp</b> knob controls the damping. 
Damping set to 1 will cut the reverb when the note is released.

The <b>Width</b> knob controls the stereo width

The <b>Level</b> knob controls the wet level

Chorus

The <b>Num</b> knob controls the number of instruments you are supposed to hear. 
This represents how many signals are being processed.

The <b>Level</b> knob controls the amount of the effect you want. 
If it is set to 0 you only hear the original sound.

The <b>Spd</b> knob controls the speed/rate of the LFO

The <b>Depth</b> knob controls the depth of the modulation. 
Higher values increase detuning.

sfxr

sfxr is a port of the original sfxr tool. 
It is used to generate retro video game sounds.
Please note that volume level of the sounds generated by sfxr varies quite a bit, especially with the RAND button.
<h2>5.14.1 Generator</h2>
The easiest way to use sfxr is with the <b>generator</b> tab in the top right corner. 
In this box are two large text buttons and seven smaller buttons.
<h2>5.14.1.1 Text Buttons</h2>
The RAND button, short for random, generates a completely random sound effect. 
Because of this, it can generate all kinds of sounds, from cool to boring, and even completely silent ones. 
To the right of it is the MUTA button, short for mutate. 
This is similar to randomizing, but instead tweaks your current sound a bit. 
It&#x27;s useful to generate variations on a sound, or change a sound slightly to (hopefully) make it better.
<h2>5.14.1.1 Icons</h2>
Underneath the RAND and MUTA buttons are seven icons. 
These each represent presets that sfxr uses to generate a specific type of sound. 
In order, they are:

​- Coin/Money pickup

​- Shooting

​- Explosion

​- Powerup

​- Damage

​- Jump

​- Interact

These generate a wide variety of sounds, while still managing to be recognizable. 
This is where sfxr really shines.
<h2>5.14.2 Controls</h2>
There are also several controls that can be used to tweak a generated sound, or to create on from scratch. 
To the left of the generator tab are the available waveforms (). 
Below this are several knobs for changing other parameters.
<h2>5.14.2.1 Envelope</h2>

<img src="https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LRtsae7H2l0Wn3A4biK%2F-LtpJ68JXFAfgs4Qc14j%2F-LtpK-z7vZaZaVYnhThQ%2Fenvelope.png?alt=media&amp;token=c861bd20-d550-4aa4-9b47-b3d8f4bcec9e">

Envelope

The top knobs are labeled <b>Env.</b>, short for envelope, and are bordered by, and connected with, blue lines. 
They decide how the volume of the sound changes over time. 
<b>ATT</b>, or attack, determines how long it takes for the sound to reach maximum volume. 
<b>HOLD</b> is how long the sound stays at this level. 
<b>SUS</b>, short for sustain, is how loud the sound gets at the start. 
Finally, <b>DEC</b>, or decay, is how long it takes for the sound to fade out.
<h2>5.14.2.2 Frequency</h2>

Frequency

Underneath the envelope knobs are the green <b>Freq.</b> knobs, which control the frequency of the sound. 
<b>START</b> is the start frequency, and <b>MIN</b> is the minimum frequency. 
<b>SLIDE</b> makes the sound change frequency over time, with a positive number making it go up, and a negative number making it go down. 
<b>D.SLI.</b>, or Delta slide, affects how fast the frequency changes. 
Values closer to 1 or -1 make the frequency change faster, while values closer to 0 make it slower. 
A negative value reverses the slide, making an upwards slide go downwards and vice versa. 
<b>V.DEP.</b>, or vibrato depth, changes how much of an effect vibrato has, while <b>V.SPD.</b>, or vibrato speed, changes how fast the vibrato is.
<h2>5.14.2.3 Change</h2>

Change

In the middle and on the right of the knobs are two red knobs, labelled <b>Change</b>. 
<b>C.AMT</b> stands for change amount, when you have positive values, the note will at a point, decided by the <b>C.SPD</b> - change speed or suddenly jump to a higher frequency. 
If you set the knob to negative values the new frequency will be lower than the original. 
This new frequency will last for as long as the note is held. 
Change amount set to 0 doesn&#x27;t affect the sound. 
Change amount set to 0.25 raises the tone with one semitone. 
Change amount set to 1 raises the tone with 3 octaves and 4 semitones. 
The Change speed takes the note frequency in consideration on it&#x27;s calculations, a low frequency note plays the original note longer before jumping to the new frequency than a high note does. 
Even if change speed is set to 0, the note will jump.

Repeat

Under the middle and on the left of the knobs is a section called <b>Repeat</b>, with only one grey knob, <b>R.SPD.</b> or repeat speed. 
Setting this knob to anything other than zero will play the sound twice, with a slight delay in between. 
The higher the value, the shorter the delay.
<h2>5.14.2.6 Phaser</h2>

Phaser

Under the middle and to the right is a section labelled <b>Phaser</b>, with two silver knobs. 
<b>PH.OFF.</b> or phaser offset, and <b>PH.S.</b> or phaser sweep. 
A phaser combines a signal with an offset version of itself, leading to phase cancellation in some frequencies. 
In practical terms this leads to a shifting filter effect.
<h2>5.14.2.7 Filter</h2>

Filter

All the way at the bottom, there are five purple knobs, labelled <b>Filter</b>. 
The ones that start with L are low pass filter settings, and the ones that start with H are high pass filter settings. 
<b>LF.C.</b> and <b>HF.C.</b> are low pass cutoff and high pass cutoff, respectively. 
On a low pass filter, frequencies below the cutoff are dampened. 
<b>LF.S.</b> and <b>HF.S.</b> are low pass sweep and high pass sweep. 
Positive values increase the filter cutoff with time (lowering it for low pass and raising it for high pass), and negative values decrease it, with numbers further from zero changing the cutoff more. 
Finally, the low pass filter has an additional resonance knob, <b>LF.R.</b>, to increase or decrease resonance. 
With resonance, frequencies near the cutoff point are boosted.

Useful for organ-like instruments. 
Due to a sine wave being only one exact frequency, normal frequency filters have little effect on sine waves.
<h2>5.16.2.2 Triangle</h2>
Similar to sine, although a lot less smooth. 
Useful for string instruments.
<h2>5.16.2.3 Sawtooth</h2>
A very sharp, &quot;synth-like&quot; sound. 
Useful for string instruments and generic &quot;synth-like&quot; instruments.
<h2>5.16.2.4 Square (Pulse)</h2>
The typical sound of vintage arcade games. 
Sounds much less old-fashioned when combined with other waveforms. 
Be cautious, as the square wave will sound a lot louder than the other waves.
<h2>5.16.2.5 Moog-like Saw</h2>
Sounds similar to saw, but can also be used for some organ-like sounds. 
The shape is due to a historic glitch in the analogue circuitry of the original Moog synthesizer.
<h2>5.16.2.6 Exponential</h2>
If used correctly, it can be used for softer synths.
<h2>5.16.2.7 White Noise</h2>
Useful for creating drum beats and other effects like wind (you might prefer to use Kicker for synthesized percussion instruments).
<h2>5.16.2.8 User-defined</h2>
Double-click to use any sound file as a waveform
<h2>5.16.3 Tips</h2>

The best results are reached by combining different waveforms with different chorus settings.

Most sounds created by a TripleOscillator sound boring and dull without an Envelope.

<h2>5.16.4 Making Patches</h2>
If you find all your instruments sound like an Atari 2600 (unless that&#x27;s what you were going for), these guidelines for creating patches that sound like familiar musical instruments or sounds will help you. 
These instructions are intentionally a bit vague, so you can easily adapt them to the type of music you want to make. 
When making patches, it often helps to have a BB track playing the sound over and over as you edit.
When creating instruments with different generators, not just TripleOscillator patches, there are a few unwanted events that may occur. 
The most frequent problem is &quot;clicks&quot;. 
The instrument sounds pretty much ok, but there&#x27;s a distinct &quot;click&quot; artifact every time the note plays. 
Clicks are annoying, but most can be easily removed. 
The start-event clicks are the easiest.
Open the ENV for VOLUME

Set AMT to maximum

Set ATTACK to just a little over 0 (try 0.04)

</ol>Listen to the sound. 
If your click artifact didn&#x27;t change a little, then the click is from the &quot;termination&quot; of the sound. 
Here the situation is more difficult. 
You may be able to remove the click by giving REL &lt;= 0.05.
Annother annoying problem is &quot;noisy crater&quot; randomly occurring in longer notes. 
This is often caused by too high ! in respect of either the cutoff Frq or the actual chosen filter. 
These type of artifacts can be seriously difficult to remove without changing the quality of the sound. 
Often success versus fiasco depends on minute alterations in Q.
If you are not familiar with terms like LFO, filters and resonance-Q amount, you should now go to the section Working with Instruments and read the paragraph The Env/LFO/Filter tab. 
All the basics (and more) are explained there.
<h2>5.16.4.1 Synth Bass</h2>
We&#x27;ll start with your basic synthesized techno bass sound, because this is a relatively simple patch to start learning your way around the TripleOscillator. 
Start with a fresh TripleOscillator with the default sine wave patch.
Start on the &quot;PLUGIN&quot; page and change the waveforms. 
Try some different combinations: a square, a triangle and a sine wave are a good combo, or set them all to saw or moog-saw.

Select the &quot;ENV/LFO&quot; page. 
Turn the filter on to &quot;LowPass&quot;, &quot;2x LowPass&quot; or &quot;Moog&quot; and turn the cutoff all the way down. 
Your sound becomes almost inaudible.

Go to the &quot;CUTOFF&quot; sub-page and turn the envelope on. 
Turn &quot;Hold&quot;, &quot;Sustain&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; to zero. 
Hear the filter now?

Now start playing with the resonance knob in the &quot;FILTER&quot; section. 
If you&#x27;re using the Moog filter, don&#x27;t turn the resonance past about 0.85 - you&#x27;ve been warned!

Now play some really low notes.

</ol><h2>5.16.4.2 Organ</h2>
Real organs are basically additive synthesizers: they add together a few dozen simple sine waves to form a complex tone. 
This is pretty easy to mimic with the TripleOscillator and LMMS&#x27; chords.
Start with a fresh sine patch, and using each oscillator&#x27;s &quot;Crs&quot; (coarse) knobs, place them in 3 different octaves.

Go to the &quot;FUNC&quot; page and turn on chords. 
Set the chord to &quot;Octave&quot; and set &quot;RANGE&quot; to 3 or 4. 
Neat, eh?

Play different C&#x27;s. 
They sound similar, don&#x27;t they? That&#x27;s because most of the harmonics are the same.

For some fun, change on of the oscillators to a triangle wave.

You can refine the sound by changing which octaves each oscillator plays in, or by adjusting their relative volumes.

</ol><h2>5.16.4.3 Electric Bass</h2>
Electric bass guitars produce a wide variety of tones. 
This is just your basic bass with no overdrive or anything like that.
Start with a sine patch and mute OSC 1. 
Turn OSC 2&#x27;s volume to 100%.

Set &quot;OSC 2 + OSC 3&quot; to PM (Phase Modulation).

Turn on the volume envelope and give it a long decay, very short release and an attack around 1/50 or 1/20 of a second.

Go to the &quot;FX&quot; page and add a TAP Chorus/Flanger effect. 
This adds an extra layer of richness to the sound.

Now, go back to the &quot;PLUGIN&quot; page and decide where you want OSC 3&#x27;s volume (that is, the amount of phase modulation between OSC 3 and OSC 2).

Finally, reinforce the fundamental (lowest harmonic) of your sound by turning OSC 1 up just a bit. 
This is optional. 
Or you can use a triangle wave. 
Whatever, it&#x27;s your sound.

</ol><h2>5.16.4.4 Kick Drum</h2>
Ok, this is going to sound weird to some, maybe. 
Why use TripleOscillator to make a kick drum? The answer: because you can. 
Also, because it can produce some pretty neat sounds! We&#x27;re going to use a technique called subtractive synthesis here. 
To make this tutorial easier to follow, I&#x27;m marking with [tags] which is the name of the tab you need to be on on the instrument window.
[Plugin] To start with, we&#x27;ll make some noise. 
Set all the oscillators to produce white noise. 
The other settings don&#x27;t matter at this point, as most of them don&#x27;t have any effect on the noise generation. 
Then we&#x27;ll move on to the Env/Lfo tab. 
That&#x27;s where the magic happens.
[Env/Lfo] Here, we&#x27;re going to set the volume envelope first. 
Here are good settings for it:

Amt: 1 (full)

Del: 0

Att: 0

Hold: 0

Dec: 0.248

Sus: 1

Rel: 0

Ok, try it now. 
Right now you have a neat little snare drum, kind of a crappy one but still. 
But read onwards, let&#x27;s make it into a good kick.
Enable the filter. 
Select the RC Bandpass (24dB) filter. 
It is important to pick the right filter, it won&#x27;t work so well with the 12dB one, unless you wan some weird kick drum... 
Set the resonance to maximum and cutoff to minimum (that is, 10.0 and 1Hz, respectively). 
Now, the instrument should sound like a bass guitar that constantly plays the same note. 
But we&#x27;re not done yet.
Go to the cutoff envelope, and set these values:

Amt: 0.2

Del: 0.02

Att: 0

Hold: 0.05

Dec: 0.187

Sus: 1

Rel: 0

Now listen to the sound. 
It&#x27;s a kick drum! How awesome is that? Now we can add some character to the sound. 
Go back to the plugin tab.
[Plugin] Now, set the first oscillator to saw wave, set the Crs dial to -24, and try playing different notes (C3 - G4 are good). 
See how the character of the sound varies slightly! You can vary it further by adjusting the volume of the saw oscillator. 
Try detuning it with the FL/FR knobs. 
Turn the SPD knob up to give it some stereo effect. 
You can also try different waveforms to see how they affect the sound. 
You can even change the second oscillator, it&#x27;s enough that there&#x27;s one noise oscillator to produce enough frequencies to subtract from. 
You can try all kinds of weird things now to create weird, cool and fun bass/kick drum sounds, and you have much more control and fine-tune over it than you have in Kicker.

<h2>5.19 ZynAddSubFX</h2>ZynAddSubFX is a powerful synthesizer with a wide range of sounds.

ZynAddSubFX

This article will not cover ZynAddSubFX, not even remotely. 
It would without any kind of &quot;story-telling&quot; be easy to write a 500 page book, and still come up short...! If you want to learn the most important features, you should watch the Video resources#ZynAddSubFX, there you can get specific hands-on visualizations of the most important things.
Here, we will only look at the special LMMS controllers and that is an absolute insignificant scratch of the surface, of this amazing synthesizer!
ZynAddSubFX is actually an embedded and fully integrated open source VST. 
That is also the reason, that the LMMS ENV/LFO tab is empty. 
VSTs can&#x27;t utilize those. 
ZynAddSubFX has been given a special LMMS UI, that gives you access to its seven different internal settings:

<b>PORT:</b> stands for &quot;Portamento&quot;. 
The setting is OFF when it is below 50%, and ON when over 50%. 
You can not alter the slide-duration, for that you need to access the ZynAddSubFX controllers.

<b>FREQ:</b> it is the cutoff frequency of the default Low-pass 1 stages 12dB filter

<b>RES (Resonance):</b> also known as &quot;Q&quot; of the default filter. 
Resonance increases the chosen part of the filter cutoff. 
Kind of a &quot;hump&quot; in the spectrum. 
You hear this as &quot;sharpness&quot; versus &quot;dull&quot; expression of the sound. 
Too much resonance causes distortion, and can harm both hearing! and speakers. 
The default presets in the ZynAddSubFX folders should only use moderate Q, because the internal ZynAddSubFX Q is quite high! Serious clipping from factory ZynAddSubFX presets will often be solvable, if you moderate the Q, sometimes significantly. 
(When you make your own ZynAddSubFX presets, a Q &lt;~ 10 is recommended.)

<b>BW Wave Bandwidth: </b>comes out as detuning of the waveform, and it is a very nice sound, indeed. 
Unfortunately, not all ZynAddSubFX factory presets will allow Bandwidth modulation. 
There need to be either <em>UNISON</em> or several <em>PARTS</em> of the instrument.

<b>FM GAIN Frequency Modulation intensity:</b> this dial will increase any modulation, that has been built inside the ZynAddSubFX preset. 
Not just FM. 
By default this dial will not change anything, because no factory presets have any modulation.

<b>RES CF &amp; RES BW Resonance Center Frequency &amp; Resonance Bandwidth:</b> these settings are not working with the default ZynAddSubFX presets. 
In order to activate them, a <em>Resonance envelope</em> needs to be made, inside ZynAddSubFX.

How to control FM GAIN, RES CF &amp; RES BW is explained in some of the Video resources.

Dynamics Processor

Dynamic Processor allows modification of signal dynamics, including compression, gating, expanding, or any other dynamics modifications.
This plugin is very similar to Waveshaper.
<h2>X/Y Graph</h2>
<b>Curve:</b> represents dynamic range in a linear scale of 0-1 amplitude.

<b>X axis:</b> represents the peak level of input.

<b>Y axis:</b> represents target level of output.

The Graph shows exact sample values rather than dbFS, making it appear non-linear.
Also note that a line of <code spellcheck="false">x=y</code> will not alter the signal.

<h2>Graph Editing</h2>

<code spellcheck="false">Left Click</code> draws lines following the cursor.

<code spellcheck="false">Shift + Left Click</code> draws a straight line between the current and last point.

<b>+/- 1dB:</b> shifts graph line along the Y axis.

<b>SMOOTH:</b> smooths graph via cubic interpolation.

<b>RESET:</b> nukes graph and reverts it to default <code spellcheck="false">x=y</code> function.

<h2>Knobs</h2>
<b>INPUT:</b> adjusts level of input gain.

<b>OUTPUT:</b> adjusts level of output gain.

<b>ATTACK:</b> adjusts how quickly the peak level rises.

<b>RELEASE:</b> adjusts how quickly the peak level falls.

These controls are analogous to those of a compressor.

<h2>Peak Detection</h2>
The level of the signal is measured in peak levels, there are three modes of peak detection:

<b>MAXIMUM:</b> measures the maximum amplitude between the left and right channel.

<b>AVERAGE:</b> measures the average amplitude between the left and right channels.

<b>UNLINKED:</b> separately measures amplitude between the left and right channels. 
(The same dynamics curve and pre/post amplification is applied to both channels)

<h2>7.1 Glossary</h2>Here is a list of terms used in LMMS with their meaning. 
There can also be found few musical terms. 
When communicating with other musicians and developers, please use the correct terms as this will be more efficient and easier for both parts.
<h2>7.1.1 A</h2>
<h2>7.1.1.1 Automation</h2>
Setting the position of a knob or other control in LMMS over time by a manually-drawn envelope. 
Automation is edited in the Automation Editor for individual controls.
<h2>7.1.1.2 A Capella</h2>
Singing a song without instrument accompaniment.
<h2>7.1.2 B</h2>
<h2>7.1.2.1 Bit Depth</h2>
The resolution of each sample. 
The number of volume steps in each sample. 
The number of bits in each sample.
<h2>7.1.3 C</h2>
<h2>7.1.3.1 Compression</h2>
Making a file smaller. 
It can be done in two ways:
<b>Lossy</b> compression makes the file smaller by loosing (unimportant) information (bits). 
Ogg and mp3 are examples of lossy compressed audio files.

<b>Lossless</b> compression makes the file smaller by writing it in a smarter way (like zip files), thus no information gets lost. 
Flac is an example of lossless compressed audio files.

</ol><h2>7.1.3.2 Compressor</h2>
Reduces the dynamic range by amplifying quiet sounds and reducing the volume of loud sounds. 
This is a science in itself, with a lot of possibilities, thus you should read more about compression to understand why the first sentence isn&#x27;t necessarily true.
<h2>7.1.3.3 Controller</h2>
Setting the position of a knob or other control in LMMS over time by a generated envelope such as an LFO. 
This differs from automation because automation is drawn manually by the user and is often not a repeated effect such as a sine, square or saw wave, whereas controllers use such waves to give a regular pattern to a control.
<h2>7.1.4 D</h2>
<h2>7.1.4.1 Damping</h2>
How the sound is decaying. 
A knob controlling damping controls how the decay sounds, e.g. 
how fast it goes silent.
<h2>7.1.4.2 Dry</h2>
When about music/sound: dry sound is a term used on sound without reverb or echo.
<h2>7.1.4.3 Dynamic Range</h2>
The ratio between the best and weakest sound in a song. 
A song with high dynamic range have very weak and very b sounds.
<h2>7.1.5 E</h2>
<h2>7.1.5.1 EQ</h2>
Abbreviation for equalizer. 
An equalizer adjusts the balance between frequencies (by adjusting the amplitude of audio signals at particular frequencies). 
Equalizers often appear as frequency-specific volume knobs.
<h2>7.1.5.2 Envelope</h2>
An envelope is a way to control how the sound changes over time. 
From when the sound starts, while the note is held to when the note ends, you can control with an envelope. 
The ADSR envelope is perhaps the most common, it consists of ways to control the attack, decay, sustain and release.
<h2>7.1.6 F</h2>
<h2>7.1.6.1 Filter</h2>
A filter alters the frequency spectrum of a sound coming out of an oscillator. 
Common filters are low-pass (meaning low frequencies are let through), high-pass (allowing high frequencies through), notch (blocking a narrow range of frequencies), and band-pass (allowing only a narrow range of frequencies). 
Filters, even in the digital world, cannot be truly linear, i.e. 
the graph of the filter&#x27;s response over frequency shows a curved &quot;knee&quot; dropping rather than a vertical line. 
This means that a low-pass filter set to 100Hz will let some frequencies lower than that through, although the lower the frequency, the more it will be cut. 
The steepness of the drop in a filter is called it&#x27;s Q parameter. 
Historically, some analog filters also introduced &quot;resonance&quot; or amplification of frequencies around the &quot;knee&quot; point in the filter. 
This effect has been used in much electronic music and is included in LMMS
<h2>7.1.6.2 FX</h2>
Short for effects.
<h2>7.1.7 L</h2>
<h2>7.1.7.1 LADSPA</h2>
It&#x27;s an acronym for Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin API. 
It is a standard for handling filters and effects, licensed under the GNU LGPL. 
It was originally designed for Linux through consensus on the Linux Audio Developers Mailing List, but works on a variety of other platforms. 
It is used in many free audio software projects and there is a wide range of LADSPA plugins available.
<h2>7.1.7.2 LFO</h2>
Acronym for Low Frequency Oscillator. 
This typically refers to oscillators whose usual frequency is in the 0.1 - 10Hz range, i.e. 
from one beat every ten seconds to ten beats every second. 
Above this frequency the oscillator is generating frequencies in the audible spectrum and the &quot;low frequency&quot; prefix is not used. 
LFOs are typically used to control things such as filter sweeps and amplitude oscillation (&quot;vibrato&quot;).
<h2>7.1.7.3 LMMS</h2>
Originally acronym for Linux MultiMedia Studio. 
Today it runs on Windows and Mac as well, and therefore is an abbreviation of your choice.
<h2>7.1.8 O</h2>
<h2>7.1.8.1 Ogg</h2>

<h2>7.1.9 P</h2>
<h2>7.1.9.1 Peak Controller</h2>
A Peak controller is similar to a noise gate, but with greater flexibility. 
Peak controllers are commonly placed on a percussion track, and then use the output signal to control the volume of another sustained sound. 
This results in the sustained sound being chopped up in time with the percussion.

<h2>7.1.15 W</h2>
<h2>7.1.15.1 WAV</h2>
Waveform Audio File Format. 
A cross-platform uncompressed audio standard.
<h2>7.1.15.2 Waveform</h2>
A waveform describes the shape of a sound. 
Different types of waveforms include:

<b>Sine:</b> the simplest waveform, it will only produce the fundamental frequency of a note, without any harmonics

<b>Triangle:</b> produces sound similar to sine, but with some harmonics. 
Triangle waves in LMMS are symmetric.

<b>Saw:</b> produces a large amount of harmonics and is used in the synthesis of a large number of sounds. 
Somewhat nasal.

<b>Square:</b> a symmetric pulse wave, sounds very digital/buzzy

<b>Moog-like-saw:</b> less high-end frequencies than a normal saw wave

<b>Exponential:</b> similar to a triangle wave, but with more high-end frequencies

<b>Noise:</b> random, produces every frequency

<h2>7.1.15.3 Wet</h2>
When about music/sound, used to describe sound with reverb or echo.
<h2>7.1.15.4 Width</h2>
When about music/sound, describes how stereo it sounds. 
Effects which increase the stereo are commonly called stereo wideners. 
To achieve this effect various techniques can be used, the most easy being delay between right and left channel.

7.1.1 A

7.1.1.1 Automation

Setting the position of a knob or other control in LMMS over time by a manually-drawn envelope. 
Automation is edited in the Automation Editor for individual controls.

7.1.1.2 A Capella

Singing a song without instrument accompaniment.

7.1.2 B

7.1.2.1 Bit Depth

The resolution of each sample. 
The number of volume steps in each sample. 
The number of bits in each sample.

7.1.3 C

7.1.3.1 Compression

Making a file smaller. 
It can be done in two ways:

 
 
7.1.3.2 Compressor

Reduces the dynamic range by amplifying quiet sounds and reducing the volume of loud sounds. 
This is a science in itself, with a lot of possibilities, thus you should read more about compression to understand why the first sentence isn't necessarily true.

7.1.3.3 Controller

Setting the position of a knob or other control in LMMS over time by a generated envelope such as an LFO. 
This differs from automation because automation is drawn manually by the user and is often not a repeated effect such as a sine, square or saw wave, whereas controllers use such waves to give a regular pattern to a control.

7.1.4 D

7.1.4.1 Damping

How the sound is decaying. 
A knob controlling damping controls how the decay sounds, e.g. 
how fast it goes silent.

7.1.4.2 Dry

When about music/sound: dry sound is a term used on sound without reverb or echo.

7.1.4.3 Dynamic Range

The ratio between the best and weakest sound in a song. 
A song with high dynamic range have very weak and very b sounds.

7.1.5 E

7.1.5.1 EQ

Abbreviation for equalizer. 
An equalizer adjusts the balance between frequencies (by adjusting the amplitude of audio signals at particular frequencies). 
Equalizers often appear as frequency-specific volume knobs.

7.1.5.2 Envelope

An envelope is a way to control how the sound changes over time. 
From when the sound starts, while the note is held to when the note ends, you can control with an envelope. 
The ADSR envelope is perhaps the most common, it consists of ways to control the attack, decay, sustain and release.

7.1.6 F

7.1.6.1 Filter

A filter alters the frequency spectrum of a sound coming out of an oscillator. 
Common filters are low-pass (meaning low frequencies are let through), high-pass (allowing high frequencies through), notch (blocking a narrow range of frequencies), and band-pass (allowing only a narrow range of frequencies). 
Filters, even in the digital world, cannot be truly linear, i.e. 
the graph of the filter's response over frequency shows a curved \"knee\" dropping rather than a vertical line. 
This means that a low-pass filter set to 100Hz will let some frequencies lower than that through, although the lower the frequency, the more it will be cut. 
The steepness of the drop in a filter is called it's Q parameter. 
Historically, some analog filters also introduced \"resonance\" or amplification of frequencies around the \"knee\" point in the filter. 
This effect has been used in much electronic music and is included in LMMS

7.1.6.2 FX

Short for effects.

7.1.7 L

7.1.7.1 LADSPA

It's an acronym for Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin API. 
It is a standard for handling filters and effects, licensed under the GNU LGPL. 
It was originally designed for Linux through consensus on the Linux Audio Developers Mailing List, but works on a variety of other platforms. 
It is used in many free audio software projects and there is a wide range of LADSPA plugins available.

7.1.7.2 LFO

Acronym for Low Frequency Oscillator. 
This typically refers to oscillators whose usual frequency is in the 0.1 - 10Hz range, i.e. 
from one beat every ten seconds to ten beats every second. 
Above this frequency the oscillator is generating frequencies in the audible spectrum and the \"low frequency\" prefix is not used. 
LFOs are typically used to control things such as filter sweeps and amplitude oscillation (\"vibrato\").

7.1.7.3 LMMS

Originally acronym for Linux MultiMedia Studio. 
Today it runs on Windows and Mac as well, and therefore is an abbreviation of your choice.

7.1.8 O

7.1.8.1 Ogg

Ogg is a free, open standard container format by the Xiph.Org foundation. 
Similarly to MP3, it is designed to provide efficient streaming and manipulation of high quality digital multimedia.
