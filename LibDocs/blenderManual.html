<h2>Introduction</h2>
Welcome to Blender, the free and open source 3D creation suite.
Blender can be used to create 3D visualizations such as
still images, 3D animations, VFX shots, and video editing.
Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who
benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.

Blender is a cross-platform application, running on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.
Blender also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites.
Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/getting-started_about_introduction_screenshot.jpg" />
<h2>Who uses Blender?</h2>
Blender has a wide variety of tools making it suitable for almost any sort of media production.

People and studios around the world use it for hobby projects, commercials, and feature films.
Check out the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/features/user-stories/">User Stories page</a>
on the Blender website for more examples.
<h2>Key Features</h2>
Blender is a fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Modeling</span></a>,

<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Rendering</span></a>,
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Animation &amp; Rigging</span></a>,
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/index.html"><span class="blue">Video Editing</span></a>,
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/movie_clip/index.html"><span class="blue">VFX</span></a>,
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Compositing</span></a>,
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/uv/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Texturing</span></a>,

and many types of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/physics/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Simulations</span></a>.
It is cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms
(and customizable with Python scripts).
It has a high-quality 3D architecture, enabling fast and efficient creation workflow.
It boasts active community support, see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/community">blender.org/community</a>
for an extensive list of sites.

It has a small executable, which is optionally portable.
You can download the latest version of Blender <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/download/">here</a>.

Blender makes it possible to perform a wide range of tasks, and it may seem daunting
when first trying to grasp the basics. However, with a bit of motivation and the right learning material,

it is possible to familiarize yourself with Blender after a few hours of practice.
This manual is a good start, though it serves more as a reference.
There are also many online video tutorials from specialized websites.
Despite everything Blender can do, it remains a tool. Great artists do not create masterpieces
by pressing buttons or manipulating brushes, but by learning and practicing subjects
such as human anatomy, composition, lighting, animation principles, etc.

3D creation software such as Blender have an added technical complexity and
jargon associated with the underlying technologies.
Terms like UV maps, materials, shaders, meshes, and “subdivs” are the media of the digital artist,
and understanding them, even broadly, will help you to use Blender to its best.
So keep reading this manual, learn the great tool that Blender is, keep your mind open to
other artistic and technological areas and you too can become a great artist.

<h2><span class="greenbut">The Blender Community</span></h2>
Being freely available from the start, even while it was closed source,
considerably helped Blender's adoption by the community.
A large, stable, and active community of users has gathered around Blender since 1998.
The community showed its support for Blender in 2002 when they helped raise
€100,000 in seven weeks to enable Blender to go Open Source under

the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL License</a>.
<h2>Independent Sites</h2>
There are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/support/user-community/">several independent websites</a>
such as forums, blogs, news, and tutorial sites dedicated to Blender.
One of the largest community forums is <a class="reference external" href="http://blenderartists.org/forum/">Blender Artists</a>,
where Blender users gather to show off their creations,

get feedback, ask and offer help and, in general, discuss Blender.
<h2>Getting Support</h2>
Blender's community is one of its greatest features, so apart from this user manual,
there are many different ways to get support from other users, such as <a href="#blender-chat"><span class="std std-ref">Blender Chat</span></a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>.
There are also more official sources of support,

such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/certification/">Certified Trainers</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.blender.org/">Blender Cloud</a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Here are some preferences that you may wish to set initially.
The full list and explanation of the Preferences are documented in the section
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/index.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a>.
<h2>Language</h2>
Enable <span class="saddlebrown">Edit ‣ Interface ‣ Translation</span>,

and choose the Language and what to translate from Interface, Tooltips and New Data.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/interface.html#prefs-interface-translation"><span class="std std-ref">Translation</span></a> for details.
<h2>Input</h2>
If you have a compact keyboard without a separate number pad, enable
<span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ Input ‣ Keyboard ‣ Emulate Numpad</span>.
If you do not have a middle mouse button, you can enable

<span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ Input ‣ Mouse ‣ Emulate 3 Button Mouse</span>.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/input.html"><span class="blue">Input Preferences</span></a> for details.
<h2>File and Paths</h2>
At <span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ File Paths</span>
you can set options such as what external Image Editor to use,
such as GIMP or Krita, and the Animation Player.

The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html#temp-dir"><span class="std std-ref">Temporary Directory</span></a> sets where to store files such as temporary renders and auto-saves.
Tip
The <code><span class="sapphire">//</span></code> at the start of each path in Blender means the directory of the currently opened blend-file,
used to reference relative paths.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/file_paths.html"><span class="blue">File Preferences</span></a> for details.
<h2>Save &amp; Load</h2>

If you trust the source of your blend-files, you can enable Auto Run Python Scripts.
This option is meant to protect you from malicious Python scripts that someone can include inside a blend-file.
This would not happen by accident,
many users leave this option on to automatically run scripts often used in advanced rigs
(such as “Rigify” that controls the skeleton of a human rig).
See Save &amp; Load <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/save_load.html#prefs-auto-execution"><span class="std std-ref">Auto Execution</span></a> Preference.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Configuring Peripherals</span></h2>
<h2>Displays</h2>
A full HD display or higher is recommended.
Multi-monitor setups are supported, and workspaces can be configured to span multiple monitors.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/getting-started_configuration_hardware_multi-monitor.jpg" />
<span class="orange">Example of Blender's multi-monitor support.</span>

<h2>Input Devices</h2>
Blender supports various types of input devices:
Keyboard (recommended: keyboard with numeric keypad, English layout works best)
Mouse (recommended: three button mouse with scroll wheel)
NDOF Device (also known as 3D Mouse)
Graphic Tablet

Note
If you are missing an input device such as a mouse or numpad Blender
can change its <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/keymap/blender_default.html"><span class="blue">keymap</span></a> to emulate these devices.
Settings to enable this can be found in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/input.html"><span class="blue">Input Preferences</span></a>.
<h3>Mouse</h3>
<h4>Mouse Button Emulation</h4>

If you do not have a 3 button mouse,
you will need to emulate it by checking the option in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/input.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a>.
The following table shows the combinations used:

<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<h4>Numpad Emulation</h4>
If you do not have a numeric Numpad on the side of your keyboard,
you may want to emulate one (uses the numbers at the top of the keyboard instead,
however, removes quick access to layer visibility).

See also
Read more about Numpad Emulation in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/input.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a>.
<h4>Non-English Keyboards</h4>
If you use a keyboard with a non-English keyboard layout, you still may benefit from switching
your computer to the UK or US layout as long as you work with Blender.
Note

You can also change the default keymap and
default hotkeys from the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/input.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a>,
however, this manual assumes you are using the default keymap.
<h3>Graphic Tablet</h3>
Graphics tablets can be used to provide a more traditional method of controlling the mouse cursor using a pen.
This can help provide a more familiar experience for artists

who are used to painting and drawing with similar tools,
as well as provide additional controls such as pressure sensitivity.
Note
If you are using a graphic tablet instead of a mouse and pressure sensitivity does not work properly,
try to place the mouse pointer in the Blender window and then unplug/replug your graphic tablet. This might help.
<h3>NDOF (3D Mouse)</h3>

3D mice or <abbr title="N-Degrees of Freedom">NDOF</abbr> devices are hardware that you can use to navigate a scene in Blender.
Currently only devices made by 3Dconnexion are supported.
These devices allow you to explore a scene, as well as <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/navigate/walk_fly.html#dview-fly-walk"><span class="std std-ref">Fly/Walk modes</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Defaults</span></h2>

When you start Blender for the first time, the interactive region of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/splash.html"><span class="blue">Splash Screen</span></a>
is replaced with a couple of initial preferences to configure how you interact inside Blender.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_introduction_default-startup.png" />
<span class="orange">The default startup Blender window.</span>
Blender's interface is separated into three main parts:
<a href="topbar.html"><span class="blue">Topbar</span></a> at the very top.
<a href="areas.html"><span class="blue">Areas</span></a> in the middle.
<a href="status_bar.html"><span class="blue">Status Bar</span></a> at the bottom.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_introduction_default-screen.png" />
<span class="orange">Blender's default Screen Layout. Topbar (blue), Areas (green) and Status Bar (red).</span>
<h2>Customization</h2>
Blender also makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts to speed up work.
These can also be customized in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/keymap.html#prefs-input-keymap-editor"><span class="std std-ref">Keymap Editor</span></a>.
Theme colors

Blender allows for most of its interface color settings to be changed to suit the needs of the user.
If you find that the colors you see on screen do not match those mentioned
in the Manual then it could be that your default theme has been altered.
Creating a new theme or selecting/altering a pre-existing one can be done by selecting
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/index.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a> editor and clicking on the Themes tab.

<br>
<dt>Link…: Links data from an external blend-file (library) to the current scene.
The edition of that data is only possible in the external library.
Link and Append are used to load in only selected parts from another file.

other graphics programs. See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/import_export.html"><span class="blue">Import/Export</span></a>.</dt>
<br>
<dt>Export: Normally you save your work in a blend-file,
but you can export some or all of your work to a format that can be processed by other graphics programs.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/import_export.html"><span class="blue">Import/Export</span></a>.</dt>

<br>
<dt>External Data: External data, like texture images and other resources,
can be stored inside the blend-file (packed) or as separate files (unpacked).
Blender keeps track of all unpacked resources via a relative or absolute path.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/blend/packed_data.html#pack-unpack-data"><span class="std std-ref">pack or unpack external Data</span></a>.

<br>
<dt>Report Missing Files</dt><dd>This option is useful to check if there are links to unpacked files that no longer exist.

After selecting this option, a warning message will appear in the Info editor's header.
If no warning is shown, there are no missing external files.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Find Missing Files</dt><dd>In case you have broken links in a blend-file, this can help you to fix the problem.
A File Browser will show up. Select the desired directory (or a file within that directory),
and a search will be performed in it, recursively in all contained directories.

Every missing file found in the search will be recovered.
Those recoveries will be done as absolute paths,
so if you want to have relative paths you will need to select Make All Paths Relative.
Note
Recovered files might need to be reloaded. You can do that one by one, or
you can save the blend-file and reload it again, so that all external files are reloaded at once.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Workspaces</span></h2>
Workspaces are essentially predefined window layouts.
Blender's flexibility with <a href="areas.html"><span class="blue">Areas</span></a>

lets you create customized workspaces for different tasks such as
modeling, animating, and scripting. It is often useful to quickly switch between
different workspaces within the same file.

<h2>Default Workspaces</h2>

Blender's default startup shows the “Layout” workspace in the main area.
This workspace is a general workspace to preview your scene and objects
and contains the following <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/index.html"><span class="blue">Editors</span></a>:
3D View on top left.
Outliner on top right.
Properties editor on bottom right.

Timeline on bottom left.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_workspaces_layout.png" />
<span class="orange">Blender's Layout Workspace with four editors.</span>
3D View (yellow), Outliner (green), Properties editor (blue) and Timeline (red).
Blender also has several other workspaces added by default:
<dt class="field-odd">Modeling</dt>

<dd class="field-odd">For modification of geometry by modeling tools.</dd>
<dt class="field-even">Sculpting</dt>
<dd class="field-even">For modification of meshes by sculpting tools.</dd>

<h3>Additional Workspaces</h3>

Blender as a couple additional Workspaces to choose from when adding a new Workspace:
2D Animation
<dt class="field-odd">2D Animation</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">General workspace to work with Grease Pencil.</dd>
<dt class="field-even">2D Full Canvas</dt>
<dd class="field-even">Similar to “2D Animation” but contains a larger canvas.</dd>

<dd class="field-even">Tools to motion track and stabilize footage.</dd>
Video Editing

<dt class="field-odd">Video Editing</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">Sequence together media into one video.</dd>
<h2>Save and Override</h2>
The workspaces are saved in the blend-file.
When you open a file, enabling the Load UI in the File Browser indicates that Blender should
use the file's screen layouts and overriding the current layout.

See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/blend/open_save.html#file-load-ui"><span class="std std-ref">Load UI</span></a>.
A custom set of workspaces can be saved as a part of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/getting_started/configuration/defaults.html"><span class="blue">Defaults</span></a>.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Status Bar</span></h2>
The Status Bar is located at the very bottom of the Blender window and is used to present information.
The Status Bar can be hidden by dragging it down or from the <a href="topbar.html#topbar-window"><span class="std std-ref">Window Menu</span></a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_status-bar_ui.png" />

<span class="orange">Status Bar.</span>
<h2>Keymap Information</h2>
The region to the left of the Status Bar displays information about what mouse buttons
and keys do for each editor, mode and tool, and it updates as you hold modifier keys.
In editors with a toolbar, pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> shows the hotkey to change to a desired tool.
<h2>Status Messages</h2>

The region in the middle of the Status Bar displays information about currently running tasks or tools.
<dt>Running Tasks</dt><dd>A progress bar and a cancel button are shown while doing longer computational tasks such as rendering or baking.
Hovering over them shows a time estimate.</dd>
<dt>Report Message</dt><dd>Label for an operator to display results or warnings. It disappears after a short time.
Clicking on the icon on the left side of the report message will open
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/info_editor.html"><span class="blue">Info Editor</span></a> which shows the full message.</dd>

<h2>Resource Information</h2>
The region to the right of the Status Bar displays information about the current blend-file.
<dt>Active Collection</dt><dd>Displays the name of the current seld <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/collections/index.html"><span class="blue">Collection</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Active Object</dt><dd>Displays the name of the current selected ob.</dd>
<dt>Geometry</dt><dd>Displays information about the current loaded scene dependent on the mode and object type.
When two numbers are shown, the first one means the selected, and the second one means the total count.

This can be the number of vertices, faces, triangles (Tris) or bones.</dd>
<dt>Objects</dt><dd>Displays the number of selected objects.</dd>
<dt>Memory</dt><dd>The “Mem” label shows the calculated memory consumption by Blender.
This can help identify when you are reaching the limits of your hardware.</dd>
<dt>Blender version</dt><dd>This label displays the Blender version.</dd>
<h2>Areas</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_areas_borders.png"><br>
Area boundaries are indicated by rounded corners (yellow highlights).
The Blender window is divided up into a number of rectangles called Areas.
Areas reserve screen space for <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/index.html"><span class="blue">Editors</span></a>, such as the 3D Viewport, or the Outliner.
In general an Editor provides a way to view and modify your work through a specific part of Blender.
All hotkeys you press will affect the contents of the Editor in the Area the mouse pointer is located.

Area boundaries are indicated by rounded (beveled) corners.
Areas can be customized to match specific tasks called
<a href="workspaces.html"><span class="blue">Workspaces</span></a>,
which can then be named and saved for later use.
<h2>Resizing</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_areas_resize.png">

You can resize areas by dragging their borders with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>.
Move your mouse cursor over the border between two areas,
so that the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, and then click and drag.
<h2>Splitting</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_areas_split.png">
Splitting an area will create a new area. Placing the mouse cursor

in an area corner will change the cursor to a cross (+) to indicate that
pressing down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> will activate splitting or joining operator.
Dragging from area corner inward will split the area.
You define the split direction by dragging either horizontally or vertically.
<h2>Joining</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_areas_join.png">The Properties Editor is being joined to the Outliner.

Dragging from an area corner outward will join two areas.
The area that will be closed gets a dark overlaid arrow.
You can select which area will be closed by moving the mouse over areas.
Release the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> to complete the join.
If you press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> before releasing the mouse,
the operation will be aborted.

Note
Areas to be joined must be the same size (width or height)
in the direction you wish to join, otherwise nothing will happen.
This is so that the combined area remains a rectangle.
<h3>Area Options</h3>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> on the border opens the Area Options.

<dt>Split Area</dt><dd>Shows an indicator line that lets you select the area and position where to split.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> switches between vertical/horizontal.</dd>
<dt>Join Areas</dt><dd>Shows the join direction overlay.</dd>
<h4>Swapping Contents</h4>
You can swap the contents between two areas with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-LMB</kbd>
on one of the corners of the initial area, dragging towards the target area,

and releasing the mouse there. The two areas do not need to be side-by-side,
though they must be inside the same window.
<h2>Duplicate Area into new Window</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Area ‣ Duplicate Area into new Window</span></dd>

A new floating window containing an area can be created from
<span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Area ‣ Duplicate Area into new Window</span>.
The new window is a fully functional window, which is part of the same instance of Blender.
This can be useful, e.g. if you have multiple monitors.
You can also create a new window from an existing area by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd>
on the area corner, then drag outward slightly.

The window can be closed with the OS Close Window button.
<h2>Toggle Maximize Area</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Area ‣ Toggle Maximize Area</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>

<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Spacebar</kbd></dd>
The maximized area fill the whole application window. You can maximize an area
with <span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Area ‣ Toggle Maximize Area</span> menu entry or
keyboard shortcut <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Spacebar</kbd>. To return to normal size,
use keyboard shortcut or the Back to Previous button on the Topbar.
Note

The area your mouse is currently hovering over is the one
that will be maximized using the keyboard shortcuts.
<h2>Toggle Fullscreen Area</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Area ‣ Toggle Fullscreen Area</span></dd>

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-Spacebar</kbd></dd>
The fullscreen area contains only the main region.
To exit the fullscreen move the mouse to the top right corner
of the area to reveal the return icon.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Regions</span></h2>

Every Editor in Blender is divided into Regions.
Regions can have smaller structuring elements like
<a href="tabs_panels.html"><span class="blue">tabs and panels</span></a>
with buttons, controls and widgets placed within them.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_regions_3d-view.png" />
<span class="orange">The regions of the 3D Viewport showing the Sidebar and

the Adjust Last Operation panel after adding a Cube.</span>
Header (green), Main region (yellow), Toolbar (blue),
Sidebar (red) and Adjust Last Operation panel (pink).
<h2>Main Region</h2>
At least one region is always visible.
It is called the Main region and is the most prominent part of the editor.

Each editor has a specific purpose, so the main region and
the availability of additional regions are different between editors.
See specific documentation about each editor in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/index.html"><span class="blue">Editors</span></a> chapter.
<h2>Header</h2>
A header is a small horizontal strip, which sits either at the top or bottom of an area.
All editors have a header acting as a container for menus and commonly used tools.

<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/controls/buttons/menus.html#ui-header-menu"><span class="std std-ref">Menus</span></a> and buttons will change with the editor type and
the selected object and mode.

<span class="orange">The Header of the 3D Viewport.</span>
<h3>Context Menu</h3>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> on a header reveals a context menu with a couple options:

<dt>Show Header</dt><dd>Toggles the visibility of the header.
If a header is hidden it can be made visible again by dragging
the small arrow that appears towards the top/bottom right of the editor.</dd>
<dt>Show Tool Settings</dt><dd>Toggles the visibility of the <ass="reference internal" href="#tool-settings">Tool Settings</a>.</dd>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>
The Toolbar (on the left side of the editor area) contains a set of interactive tools.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">T</kbd> toggles the visibility of Toolbar.
This is further documented here: <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/tool_system.html#ui-region-toolbar"><span class="std std-ref">Toolbar</span></a>.
<h2>Tool Settings</h2>

The Tool Settings (at the top/bottom of the editor area)
contains as its name suggests the settings of the active tool.
It's visibility can be toggled with the header's context menu just as its position
with the Flip to Bottom/Top operator.
<h2>Adjust Last Operation</h2>
The Adjust Last Operation is a region that shows tool options when tools (operators) are run.

This is further documented here: <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a>.
<h2>Sidebar</h2>
The Sidebar (on the right side of the editor area)
contains <a href="tabs_panels.html#ui-panels"><span class="std std-ref">Panels</span></a>
with settings of objects within the editor and the editor itself.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">N</kbd> toggles the visibility of Sidebar.

<h2>Footer</h2>
Some editors show a bar (on top/bottom of the editor area)
that displays information about for example the active tool.
<h2>Arranging</h2>
<h3>Scrolling</h3>
A region can be scrolled vertically and/or horizontally by dragging it with the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">MMB</kbd>.

If the region has no zoom level, it can be scrolled by using the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Wheel</kbd>,
while the mouse hovers over it.
<h3>Changing the Size and Hiding</h3>
Resizing regions works by dragging their border, the same way as
<a href="areas.html"><span class="blue">Areas</span></a>.
To hide a region resize it down to nothing.

A hidden region leaves a little arrow sign.
By <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on this icon to make the region reappear.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Tabs &amp; Panels</span></h2>
<h2>Tabs</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_tabs-panels_tabs.png" />
Top: Horizontal Tab header in the Topbar.<br>

Bottom: Vertical Tab header shows tab icons in the Properties Editor.
Tabs are used to control overlapping sections in the user interface.<br>
Contents of only one Tab is visible at a time.<br>
Tabs are listed in Tab header, which can be vertical or horizontal.
<h3>Switching/Cycling</h3>
Vertical tabs can be switched with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Wheel</kbd> from anywhere in

the region, and horizontal tabs with mouse cursor over tab headings.
You can also cycle through tabs with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Tab</kbd> and
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl-Tab</kbd>, or press down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> and move mouse over tab header icons.
<h2>Panels</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/interface_window-system_tabs-panels_panels.png" />
<span class="orange">Panels in Properties editor.</span>

A panel is highlighted in yellow and a sub-panel in red.
The smallest organizational unit in the user interface is a panel.
Panel header is always visible, and it shows the title for the panel.
Panels may also include sub-panels.
<h3>Collapsing and Expanding</h3>
A panel can either be expanded to show its contents, or collapsed to hide its contents.

An expanded panel is indicated by a down-arrow (▼) in the panel header,
while a collapsed panel is shown with a right-arrow (►).
A click with the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on the panel header expands or collapses it.
Pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd> expands/collapses the panel under the mouse pointer.
A <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-LMB</kbd> click on the header of a specific panel will collapse
all other panels and make this the only expanded one.

Dragging with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> over the headers will expand or collapse many at once.
<h3>Position</h3>
You can change the position of a panel within its region by clicking
and dragging it with the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on the grip widget (::::)
located in the Panel Header on the right side.
<h3>Pinning</h3>

Sometimes it is desirable to view panels from different tabs at the same time.
This has been solved by making panels pinnable.
A pinned panel remains visible regardless of which tab has been selected.
You can pin a panel by clicking on the pin icon in its header.
Panels that do not have a pin icon can also be pinned by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> and selecting Pin,
alternatively you use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> on the panel to also pin it.

<h3>Zoom</h3>
The zoom factor of a whole region with panels can be changed by
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-MMB</kbd> clicking and moving the mouse anywhere within that region
or use the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadPlus</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadMinus</kbd> to zoom in and out the contents.
Pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Home</kbd> (Show All) will reset the zooming at the screen/panel focused by the mouse pointer.
<h1>Common Shortcuts</h1>

<h2>Conventions</h2>
<h3>Keyboards</h3>
Hotkey letters are shown in this manual like they appear on a keyboard; for example:
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd></dt><dd>refers to the lowercase <code><span class="sapphire">g</span></code>.
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd></dt><dd>are specified as modifier keys.

</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-W</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Alt-A</kbd>, …</dt><dd>indicates that these keys should be pressed simultaneously.
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Numpad0</kbd> to <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Numpad9</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadPlus</kbd></dt><dd>refer to the keys on the separate numeric keypad.

<h3>Mice</h3>
This manual refers to mouse buttons as:
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd></dt><dd>Left Mouse Button
</dd>

<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd></dt><dd>Right Mouse Button
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">MMB</kbd></dt><dd>Middle Mouse Button
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Wheel</kbd></dt><dd>Scrolling the wheel.
</dd>

<h2>Mouse</h2>
Blender’s default keymap has two main interaction modes: Right- and left-click-select.
In the past, Blender has used right-click-select to have a more clear
distinction between selection and action.
In this mode, the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> (Right Mouse Button) is generally used for
selection and the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> (Left Mouse Button) initiates or confirms actions.

Today, Blender users can choose between the older right-click-select method
and left-click-select, which makes Blender feel more like other software.
Video: <a class="reference external" href="https://vimeo.com/76335056">Learn the benefits of right-click-select</a>.
<h2>Hovering</h2>
While hovering (when the cursor is held over a button).
<h3>Properties</h3>

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-C</kbd> – Copy the (single) value of the button.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-V</kbd> – Paste the (single) value of the button.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-C</kbd> – Copy the entire vector or color of the field.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-V</kbd> – Paste the entire vector or color of the field.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> – Open the context menu.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Backspace</kbd> – Clear the value (sets to zero or clears a text field).

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Minus</kbd> – Negate number values (multiply by -1.0).
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Wheel</kbd> – Change the value incremental steps.
For pop-up option menus buttons, this cycles the value.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd> – Activates menus or toggles the value.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> – Hold while editing values to apply the change to all selected items
(objects, bones, sequence-strips).

This can be used for number fields and toggles.
<h3>Animation</h3>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">I</kbd> – Insert a keyframe.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-I</kbd> – Clear the keyframe.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Alt-I</kbd> – Clear all keyframes (removing all F-curves).
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-D</kbd> – Assign a driver.

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-D</kbd> – Clear the driver.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">K</kbd> – Add a Keying Set.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-K</kbd> – Clear the Keying Set.
<h3>Python Scripting</h3>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-C</kbd> – Over any <a href="../controls/buttons/buttons.html#ui-operator-buttons"><span class="std std-ref">Operator Buttons</span></a> copies their Python command into the clipboard.
This can be used in the Python Console or in the Text editor when writing scripts.

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl-C</kbd> – Over property buttons copies their data path for this property
(also available from the context menu).
Useful when writing drivers or scripts.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl-Alt-C</kbd> – Over property buttons copies their <em>full</em> data path for the data-block and property.
Note that in most cases it is best to access values based on the context, instead of by name.
<h2>Dragging</h2>

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> – While dragging, snap to discrete steps.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> – Gives precision control over the value.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl</kbd> – Precise snap will move the object with high precision
along with the snapping constraint.
<span id="ui-text-editing"></span><h2>Text Editing</h2>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Home</kbd> – Go to the start.

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">End</kbd> – Go to the end.

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-A</kbd> – Select all text.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-C</kbd> – Copy the selected text.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-X</kbd> – Cut the selected text.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-V</kbd> – Paste text at the cursor position.
<h2>Confirm and Cancel</h2>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> – Cancels.

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> – Confirms.

<h2>Platform Specific Keys</h2>

<h3>macOS</h3>
The <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Cmd</kbd> key can be used instead of <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> on macOS
for all but a few exceptions which conflict with the operating system.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Buttons</span></h2>
<h2>Operator Buttons</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_buttons_operation.png" />

<span class="orange">Operator button.</span>
Operator buttons perform an action when clicked with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>.
Button may show an icon, text, or both.
<h2>Checkboxes &amp; Toggle Buttons</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_buttons_checkbox.png" />
<span class="orange">Checkboxes and Toggle buttons.</span>

These controls are used to activate or deactivate options.
Use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> to change their state. A tick is shown on checkboxes when
the option is activated. Active status on toggle buttons is indicated
either by color on the icon background, or a change in icon graphics.
<h3>Dragging</h3>
To change many values at once on or off, you can press down

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> and drag over multiple buttons.
This works for checkboxes, toggles and to select a radio button value.
<h2>Radio Buttons</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_buttons_radio.png" />
<span class="orange">Radio buttons.</span>
Radio buttons are used to choose one option from a selection of options.

Active button is indicated by color on the icon background.
<h3>Cycling</h3>
Use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Wheel</kbd>, while hovering with the mouse over radio
buttons, to cycle between the options.
<h2>Direction Buttons</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_buttons_direction.png" />

<span class="orange">Direction buttons.</span>
Clicking with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> in the sphere and dragging the mouse cursor
lets the user change the direction by rotating the sphere.
<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> (drag) rotates the direction.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> (while dragging) snaps to vertical &amp; diagonal directions.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Fields</span></h2>
<h2>Text &amp; Search Fields</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_fields_text-search.png" />
<span class="orange">A text and a search field.</span>
Text fields show a rounded rectangular border, and optionally an icon and/or text inside the border.
Text fields store text strings, and provide the means to edit text

by <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/keymap/introduction.html"><span class="blue">standard text editing shortcuts</span></a>.
For text fields with an icon and pop-ups, see <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/templates/data_block.html#ui-data-id"><span class="std std-ref">Data ID</span></a>.
<h2>Number Fields</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_fields_number-button.png" />
<span class="orange">Number fields.</span>
Number fields store values and units.

The first type of number field shows triangles pointing left (&lt;) and right (&gt;)
on the sides of the field when mouse pointer is over the field.
Sliders, a second type of number field, have a colored bar in the background
to display values over a range, e.g. percentage values.
The value can be edited in several ways:
<dt>Incremental Steps</dt><dd>To change the value in unit steps, click <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on the small triangles

(only available on first field type).
You can also use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Wheel</kbd> while hovering over the field to edit the value.</dd>
<dt>Dragging</dt><dd>To change the value with the mouse, hold down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> and drag to left or right.
Hold <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> to snap to the discrete steps while dragging or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> for precision input.</dd>
<dt>Keyboard Input</dt><dd>Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd> to enter value by typing it with keyboard.
When entering values by keyboard, number fields work like text fields:

Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> outside the field to apply the change.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> to cancel.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> to jump to the next field or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Tab</kbd> to go to the previous field.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Minus</kbd> while hovering over a number field to negate the value.
</dd>
<h3>Multi-Value Editing</h3>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_fields_multi-value-edit.png" />
<span class="orange">Multi-value editing.</span>
You can edit multiple number fields at once by pressing down
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on the first field, and then drag vertically over
the fields you want to edit. Finally you can either drag left or right to
adjust value with the mouse, or release the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> and type in a value.

<h3>Value Limits</h3>
Most numerical values are restricted by “soft limit” and “hard limit” value ranges.
Changing values by dragging with the mouse is restricted to the “soft limit” value range.
Input via keyboard will allow the use of wider value ranges, but never wider than the “hard limit”.
<h3>Expressions</h3>
You can enter mathematical expressions into any number field.

For example, enter <code><span class="sapphire">3*2</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">10/5+4</span></code> instead of <code><span class="sapphire">6</span></code>.
Even constants like <code><span class="sapphire">pi</span></code> (3.142) or functions like <code><span class="sapphire">sqrt(2)</span></code> (square root of 2)
may be used.
See also
These expressions are evaluated by Python; for all available math expressions see:
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">Math module reference</a>.

<h4>Expressions as Drivers</h4>
You may want your expression to be re-evaluated after it is entered.
Blender supports this using <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../animation/drivers/index.html"><span class="blue">Drivers</span></a> (a feature of the animation system).
Expressions beginning with <code><span class="sapphire">#</span></code> have a special use.
Instead of evaluating the value and discarding the expression,
a driver is added to the property with the expression entered.

The expression <code><span class="sapphire">#frame</span></code> is a quick way to access map a value to the current frame,
but more complex expressions are also supported <code><span class="sapphire">#fmod(frame,</span> <span class="sapphire">24)</span> <span class="sapphire">/</span> <span class="sapphire">24</span></code> for example.
This is simply a convenient shortcut to add drivers which can also be added via the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> menu.
<h3>Units</h3>
As well as expressions, you can specify numbers and units.
If no unit is given, then a default unit is applied.

The unit system can be changed in <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../scene_layout/scene/properties.html#data-scenes-props-units"><span class="std std-ref">scene settings</span></a>.
You can use either the unit abbreviation or the full name after the value.
Examples of valid usage of length units include:
<table class="hlist"><tr><td>
<code><span class="sapphire">1cm</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">1m</span> <span class="sapphire">3mm</span></code>

<code><span class="sapphire">1m,</span> <span class="sapphire">3mm</span></code>
</td><td>
<code><span class="sapphire">2ft</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">3ft/0.5km</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">2.2mm</span> <span class="sapphire">+</span> <span class="sapphire">5'</span> <span class="sapphire">/</span> <span class="sapphire">3&quot;</span> <span class="sapphire">-</span> <span class="sapphire">2yards</span></code>
</td></tr></table>

Note
Using Units
Decimal separator is optional.
You can mix units, e.g. metric and imperial even though you can only show one at a time.
Plurals of the names are recognized too, so <code><span class="sapphire">meter</span></code> and <code><span class="sapphire">meters</span></code> can both be used.
<h2>Color Fields</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_fields_color.png" />
<span class="orange">Color fields. With and without alpha.</span>
The color field stores a color value shown in its background.
Clicking <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on color fields opens the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/templates/color_picker.html"><span class="blue">Color Picker</span></a>.
Color fields with an alpha channel are divided in half: on the left the color is shown without an alpha channel and
on the right the color with an alpha channel shown over a checker pattern.

Colors can be copied to other color fields by dragged and dropped to another color field.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Menus</span></h2>
Blender uses a variety of different menus for accessing options and tools.
Selecting menus can be interacted with in the following ways:
<dt>Mouse selection</dt><dd><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslaLMB</kbd> on the desired item.</dd>
<dt>Numerical selection</dt><dd>You can use the number keys or numpad to input an item in the list to select.

For example, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Numpad1</kbd> will select the first item and so on.</dd>
If the menu content is too large to fit on the screen, small menu
scrolling indicator triangle appears on bottom or top of menu.
Scrolling is done by moving the mouse below or above the scrolling indicator.
Shortcuts
Use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Wheel</kbd> while hovering with the mouse.

Arrow keys can be used to navigate.
Each menu item has an underlined character which can be pressed to activate it.
Number keys or numpad can be used to access menu items.
(Where <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">1</kbd> is the first menu item, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">2</kbd> the second, etc.
For larger menus <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-1</kbd> the 11th… up to <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-0</kbd> the 20th.)
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd> to activate the selected menu item.

Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> to cancel the menu, or move the mouse cursor far from the pop-up,
or by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> clicking anywhere out of it.
<h2>Header Menus</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_menu-button.png" />
<span class="orange">Image menu in the Header of the Image editor.</span>
Most <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/window_system/regions.html#ui-region-header"><span class="std std-ref">headers</span></a> exhibit a set of menus, located at the start of the header.

Header menus are used to configure the editor and access tools.
All menu entries show the relevant shortcut keys, if any.
<h3>Collapsing Menus</h3>
Sometimes it's helpful to gain some extra horizontal space in the header by collapsing menus.
This can be accessed from the header context menu,
click <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> on the header and select Collapse Menus.

<span class="orange">The 3D Viewport Mode Select menu.</span>
The Select menu (short selector) lets you choose between a set of options.
Select menu appears as an icon and/or text with down arrow on the right side of the button.
The menu options are shown with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> click on the button.
The selected option is then shown as active on the menu button.

<h2>Popover Menus</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_popup-menu.png" />
<span class="orange">The Transform Orientations pop-up menu.</span>
Popover menus are overlays.
Like Select Menus, pop-up menus also include down arrow on the right
side of menu button. However, pop-up menus allow more content to be shown,

such as title, list options, buttons, sliders, etc.
Popover menus group controls into a menu, which is automatically hidden
when mouse pointer leaves menu boundaries (including a margin).
<h2>Context Menu</h2>
Context menus are pop-ups opened with the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Menu</kbd> key for editors and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> for properties.
Context menu contents depend on the location of the mouse pointer.

When invoked in an editor the menu contains a list of operators sensitive to the editor's mode.
Or when invoked over buttons and properties common options include:
<dt>Single</dt><dd>Set or get single value.</dd>
<dt>All</dt><dd>Include all combinations.</dd>
<dt>Reset All/Single to Default Value(s)</dt><dd>Replaces the current e by the default (keyboard shortcut <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Backspace</kbd>).</dd>
<dt>Unset</dt><dd>TODO.</dd>

<dt>Copy Data Path</dt><dd>Copies the Python property Data path, relative to the data-block.

<h2>Specials Menu</h2>
The Specials pop-up menu contains a context-sensitive list of operators.

It is opened by a button with a down arrow on dark background <img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_specials.png" />.
<h2>Pie Menus</h2>
A pie menu is a menu whose items are spread radially around the mouse.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_pie-menu.png" />
<span class="orange">The 3D Viewport Mode Pie menu.</span>
<h3>Interaction</h3>

The pie menu is spawned by a key press,
which are listed in the add-on's documentation.
Tip
Fastest way to operate a Pie menu is to press down key(s) that
invoke the menu, then move mouse slightly towards a selection, and
release key(s) to activate the selection.

Releasing the key without moving the mouse will keep the menu open and
the user can then move the mouse pointer towards the direction of a pie menu item and select it by clicking.
Releasing the key, after moving the mouse towards a pie menu item, will cause the menu to close and
the selected menu item to activate.
An open disc widget at the center of the pie menu shows
the current direction of the pie menu. The selected item is also highlighted.

A pie menu will only have a valid direction for item selection,
if the mouse is touching or extending beyond the disc widget at the center of the menu.
Pie menu items support key accelerators, which are the letters underlined on each menu item.
Also number keys can be used to select the items.
If there are sub-pies available, it is indicated by a plus icon.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../editors/preferences/interface.html#prefs-pie-menu"><span class="std std-ref">Pie menu settings</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Eyedropper</span></h2>
The eyedropper (pipette icon) allows you to sample from anywhere in the Blender window.
The eyedropper can be used to select different kinds of data:
<dt>Color</dt><dd>This is the most common usage, the eyedropper isd to sample a pixels color from anywhere within Blender.</dd>
<dt>Color Ramp</dt><dd>Dragging the cursor over the window to samplline which is converted into a color ramp.</dd>
<dt>Objects/Object-Data</dt><dd>This is used with object buttons (such as parent, constraints or modifiers) to

select an object from the 3D View or Outliner.</dd>
<dt>Camera Depth</dt><dd>Number fields effecting distance can also use the eyedropper.
This is used to set the camera's depth of field so the depth chosen is in focus.</dd>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">E</kbd> will activate the eyedropper while hovering over a button.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> dragging will mix the colors you drag over, which can help when sampling noisy imagery.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar</kbd> resets and starts mixing the colors again.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Decorators</span></h2>
Decorators are small buttons that appear to the right of other buttons and show the state of the property.
Decorators may appear next to number fields, menus,
and checkboxes to indicate the property can be <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../animation/index.html"><span class="blue">animated</span></a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/interface_controls_buttons_decorators_ui.png" />
<span class="orange">Decorators indicating different property states.</span>

Clicking on the decorator dot icon will add a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../animation/keyframes/index.html"><span class="blue">Keyframe</span></a> to that property.
Clicking the rhombus icon again will remove the keyframe.
A solid rhombus icon indicates there is a keyframe on the current frame,
while a non-solid rhombus icon indicates that the property has a keyframe on another frame.
Clicking the non-solid rhombus icon will add a keyframe to the current property value and frame.
If a property is being <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../animation/drivers/index.html"><span class="blue">driven</span></a>

by another property then the decorator shows the driver icon.
Decorators make it quick and easy to glance over properties and see the state of the property.

<span class="orange">A Data ID field.</span>
A Data ID is a text field with an icon on the left, which opens a pop-up.
Data ID is a unique name for an object. Data ID is used to refer to

objects, and therefore Blender does not allow any two objects of same
type to have same ID (same name). If Data ID is already in use,
Blender will automatically append a number to the end to prevent ID collision
(for example “Cube.001”).
Menus showing Data IDs can show the following elements:
<dt>Type</dt><dd>The icon on the left specifies the accepted data-blocpe.</dd>

<dt>Name</dt><dd>The text field functions as a search field by matching elements in the list.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> to auto-complete names up to the level a match is found.
If more than one match exists, you have to continue typing.
If you type an invalid name, the value will remain unchanged.</dd>

Color Ramps enables the user to specify a range of colors based on color stops.

Color stops are similar to a mark indicating where exactly the chosen color should be.
The interval from each of the stops, added to the ramp, is a result of the color interpolation and
chosen interpolation method.

<span class="orange">Curve widget.</span>
The purpose of the Curve Widget is to allow the user to modify an input
(such as an image) in an intuitive manner by
smoothly adjusting the values up and down using the curve.
The input values are mapped to the X axis of the graph, and the output values are mapped to the Y axis.
<h2>Control Points</h2>

Like all curves in Blender, the curve of the Curve Widget is controlled using control points.
By default, there are two control points: one at (0.0, 0.0) and one at (1.0, 1.0),
meaning the input is mapped directly to the output (unchanged).
<dt>Move</dt><dd>Simply click and drag it around.</dd>

<dt>Remove</dt><dd>Select it and click the <code><span class="sapphire">X</span></code> button at the top right.</dd>

<h2>Controls</h2>
Above the curve graph is a row of controls. These are:
<dt>Zoom In (plus magnifying glass icon)</dt><dd>Zoom into the center of the graph to show more details and provide more accurate control.
To navigate around the curve while zoomed in, click and drag in an empty part of the graph.</dd>
<dt>Zoom Out (minus magnifying glass icon)</dt><dd>Zoom out of the graph to show fewer details and view the graph as a whole.
You cannot zoom out further than the clipping region (see Clipping below).</dd>

<h2>Tool System</h2>
Tools are accessed from the <a href="#ui-region-toolbar"><span class="std std-ref">Toolbar</span></a>.
This is a general introduction to tools, individual tools have their own documentation.
There can only be one active tool which is stored for each space &amp; mode.

Tools may set their own keys which override other keys
although typically they use the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>, sometimes with modifier keys.
Keymaps can be edited from the preferences.
Some tools define gizmos (Shear and Spin for example) to help control the tool.

<span class="orange">Button with pop-up menu indicator.</span>
The Toolbar shows buttons for each tool.
For tool buttons which have a small triangle in their bottom right corner, a pop-up menu will be revealed

when you <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> drag so that you can select other tools of the same group.
Hovering your cursor over a tool for a short time will show its name,
while hovering longer will show the full tooltip.
Resizing the Toolbar horizontally will display the icons with two columns.
Expanding it further will display the icon and its text.
<h2>Pop-Up Toolbar</h2>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar</kbd></dd>
Keyboard tool switching is not enabled by default. To enable it,
set the Keymap preferences <a href="keymap/blender_default.html#keymap-blender-default-spacebar-action"><span class="std std-ref">Spacebar Action</span></a> to Tools,
and then you'll be able use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar</kbd> like a modifier key (similar to pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>).

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar T</kbd> for Transform, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar D</kbd> for Annotate, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar M</kbd> for measure, etc.
<h2>Quick Favorites</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Q</kbd></dd>
The Quick Favorites menu gather your favorite tools.

Any tool or menu can be added to this pop-up menu via the context menu of buttons and menus.
<h2>Changing Tools</h2>
Pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> opens a tool prompt, shown in the <a href="window_system/status_bar.html"><span class="blue">Status Bar</span></a>,
for changing the active tool, pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> again closes the prompt.
Tools can be changed by pressing the appropriate icon or by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>
then pressing the hotkey assigned to the desired tool.

<h3>Fallback Tool</h3>
The fallback tool is the default tool in the Toolbar as in the tool at the top of the list.
To switch to this tool use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-W</kbd> to open a pie menu to choose what the default drag action does.
<h3>Cycling Tools</h3>
If you bind a key to a tool which is part of a group, you can enable the Cycle option in the keymap editor.
Successive presses will cycle through the tools in that group.

<h2>Properties</h2>
Tools can have their own settings, which are available from multiple places:
The <span class="saddlebrown">Sidebar ‣ Tools ‣ Active Tool</span> panel.
The Active Tool tab in the Properties editor.
The Tool Settings region.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Undo &amp; Redo</span></h2>

The tools listed below will let you roll back an accidental action,
redo your last action, or let you choose to recover to a specific point,
by picking from a list of recent actions recorded by Blender.
<h2>Undo</h2>

<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl-Z</kbd></dd>
To roll back the Undo action, press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl-Z</kbd>.
<h2>Adjust Last Operation</h2>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Mode</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">All Modes</dd>
<dt class="field-even">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><span class="saddlebrown">Edit ‣ Adjust Last Operation…</span></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">Hotkey</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">F9</kbd></dd>
After an operation is complete you can tweak the parameters of the operation afterwards.
In editors that support it, there is a “head-up display” panel in the bottom left
based on the last performed operation; dependent on mode and context.
Alternatively, you can create a pop-up with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">F9</kbd> which does the same thing.
For example, if your last operation was a rotation in Object Mode,

Blender will show you the last value changed for the angle
(see Fig. <a href="#fig-interface-redo-last-object-mode"><span class="std std-ref">Rotation (Object Mode, 60 degrees).</span></a> left),
where you can change your action back completely by typing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Numpad0</kbd>.
There are other useful options, based on the operator,
and you cannot only Undo actions, but change them completely using the available options.
If you are in Edit Mode,

Blender will also change its contents based on your last action taken.
In the second example (on the right), the last operation was a Move in Object Mode;
but a Scale on a Face in Edit mode, and, as you can see,
the contents of Adjust Last Operation are different, because of the mode (Edit mode)
(See Fig. <a href="#fig-interface-redo-last-edit-mode"><span class="std std-ref">Scale (Edit Mode, Resize face).</span></a> right).

Tip

Some operations produce particularly useful results by using Adjust Last Operation.
For example, adding a Circle in the 3D Viewport; if you reduce the Vertices to three,
you get a perfect equilateral triangle.
Tip
The Adjust Last Operation region can be hidden by <span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Adjust Last Operation</span>.
<h2>Undo History</h2>

<span class="orange">The Undo History menu.</span>
There is also an Undo History of the last actions taken, recorded by Blender.
The top of the list corresponds to the most recent actions.
A small icon of an eye next to one of the entries indicates the current status.
Rolling back actions using the Undo History feature will take you back to
the action you choose. Much like how you can alternate between going backward in

time with Undo and then forward with Redo,
you can hop around on the Undo timeline as much as you want as long as you do not make a new change.
Once you do make a new change, the Undo History is truncated at that point.
Selecting one of the entries in the list takes the current status to that position.

The Repeat Last feature will repeat your last action when you press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-R</kbd>.
In the example images below, we duplicated a Monkey mesh,
and then we moved the object a bit.
Using repeat <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-R</kbd>, the Monkey was also duplicated and moved.

Important
When you quit Blender, the complete list of user actions will be lost, even if you save your file before quitting.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Annotate Tool</span></h2>
The annotation tool is available in multiple editors.
It can be used to add notes to e.g. 3D objects or node setups.
The annotation tool can be activated in the Toolbar on the left side.
It has a couple of sub-tools listed below.
<dt>Annotate</dt><dd>Draw free-hand strokes in the main window.</dd>

<dt>Annotate Line</dt><dd>Click and drag to create a line.</dd>
<dt>Annotate Polygon</dt><dd>Click multiple times to create multiple connected lines.
The current polygon is finished when <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> is pressed.</dd>
<dt>Annotate Eraser</dt><dd>Click and drag to remove lines drawn previously.
The eraser has a Radius setting found in <span class="saddlebrown">Tool Settings ‣ Eraser</span>.</dd>
<h2>Settings</h2>

<h3>Common</h3>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Selecting</span></h2>

By default Blender uses the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> to select items in the Blender window.
Alternatively, the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> can be used instead by changing
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/keymap.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a>.
Blender has several selecting tools that can be used across the different editors.
<h2>Selection Tools</h2>
<h3>Tweak</h3>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd></dd>
Clicking on an item selects it, using modifier keys you can perform other operations.
Holding the selection and moving the mouse on interactive items such has objects in the 3D Viewport
or keyframes in an animation editor will general move the item with the mouse.

<h3>Select Box</h3>

The Shader Editor is used to edit materials which are used for <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/index.html"><span class="blue">rendering</span></a>.
Materials used by Cycles and Eevee are defined using a node tree.
Therefore, the main window of the Shader editor is a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/nodes/index.html"><span class="blue">node editor</span></a>.

<h2>Timeline</h2>
The Timeline editor, identified by a clock icon, is used for manipulating keyframes and
scrubbing the playhead.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_timeline_interface.png" />
<span class="orange">The Timeline.</span>

The Timeline gives the user a broad overview of a scene's animation,
by showing the current frame, the keyframes of the active object,
the start and end frames of your animation sequence, as well as markers set by the user.
The Timeline includes Transport Controls, to play, pause, and skip through an animation sequence.
It also includes tools for manipulating Keyframes, Keying Sets, and Markers.
<h2>Main View</h2>

The main Timeline region displays the animation frames over time.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_timeline_main.png" />
Here you can see the Keyframes (diamond shapes), Playhead (blue handle), Scrollbar (along the bottom).
<h3>Adjusting the View</h3>
The Timeline can be panned by holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">MMB</kbd>,
then dragging the area left or right.

You can zoom the Timeline by using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-MMB</kbd>, the mouse <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Wheel</kbd>,
or pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadMinus</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadPlus</kbd>.
You can also use the scrollbars, located at the bottom or the right of the editor, to pan and zoom the view.
<h3>Playhead</h3>
The Playhead is the blue vertical line with the current frame number at the top.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_timeline_cursor.png" />

<span class="orange">Playhead.</span>
The Playhead can be set or moved to a new position by pressing or
holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> in scrubbing area at the top of the timeline.
The Playhead can be moved in single-frame increments by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Left</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Right</kbd>,
or you can jump to the beginning or end frame by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Left</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Right</kbd>.
<h3>Frame Range</h3>

By default, the Frame Range is set to start at frame 1 and end at frame 250.
You can change the frame range in the top right of the Timeline header, or in the Output Properties.
<h3>Keyframes</h3>
For the active and selected objects, keyframes are displayed as diamond shapes.
You can click to select one at a time, or select several by holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>,
or by dragging a box around the keyframes.

You can then move single keys by dragging them,
and you can move multiple keys by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd> and scale them with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd>.
Only Selected Channels can be enabled. <span class="saddlebrown">Timeline ‣ View ‣ Only Selected Channels</span>.
For Armatures, this will display the object keyframes,
and the keyframes for the active and selected pose bones.
<h3>Markers</h3>

See the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/markers.html"><span class="blue">Markers page</span></a> for more information.

<h4>Keying Popover</h4>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_timeline_keying.png" />
The Keying popover contains options that affect keyframe insertion.

<dt>Active Keying Set</dt><dd>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_timeline_keying-sets.png" />
<span class="orange">Timeline Keying Sets.</span>
Keying Sets are a set of keyframe channels in one.
They are made so the user can record multiple properties at the same time.
With a keying set selected, when you insert a keyframe,

Blender will add keyframes for the properties in the active Keying Set.
There are some built-in keying sets, LocRotScale, and also custom keying sets.
Custom keying sets can be defined in the panels
<span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Scene ‣ Keying Sets + Active Keying Set</span>.
<dt>Insert Keyframes (plus icon)</dt><dd>Insert keyframes on the currerame for the properties in the active Keying Set.</dd>

is applied to preserve the cycle integrity (most useful while tweaking an established cycle):
If a key insertion is attempted outside of the main time range of the cycle,
it is remapped back inside the range.
When overwriting one of the end keys,

the other one is updated appropriately.

<span class="orange">Timeline Auto Keyframe.</span>
The record button enables Auto Keyframe:
It will add and/or replace existing keyframes for the active object when you transform it in the 3D View.
For example, when enabled, first set the Playhead to the desired frame,
then move an object in the 3D View, or set a new value for a property in the UI.
When you set a new value for the properties,

Blender will add keyframes on the current frame for the transform properties.
Other use cases are <a href="3dview/navigate/walk_fly.html#dview-fly-walk"><span class="std std-ref">Fly/Walk Mode</span></a> to record the walk/flight path
and <a href="3dview/properties/sidebar.html#dview-lock-camera-to-view"><span class="std std-ref">Lock Camera to View</span></a> to record the navigation in camera view.
Note
Note that Auto Keyframe only works for transform properties (objects and bones),
in the 3D Views (i.e. you can't use it e.g. to animate the colors of a material in the Properties editor…).

<h2>Text Editor</h2>
Blender has a Text Editor among its editor types,
accessible via the Editor type menu, or the shortcut <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-F11</kbd>.
<h2>Header</h2>

The newly opened Text editor is empty, with a very simple header.
More options become available when a text file is created or opened.

<h3>Template Menu</h3>
The Text Editor has some dedicated Python scripts,
which are useful for writing tools, like a class/function/variable browser, completion…
Python, OpenShading Language

<h2>Main View</h2>
Typing on the keyboard produces text in the text buffer.
As usual, pressing, dragging and releasing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> selects text.
Pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> opens the context menu.
Tip
Usages for the Text editor

The Text editor is handy also when you want to share your blend-files with others.
The Text editor can be used to write in a <code><span class="sapphire">README</span></code> text explaining the contents of your blend-file.
Be sure to keep it visible when saving!
<h2>Footer</h2>
The Text editor footer displays if the text is saved internal or external and
if there are unsaved changes to an external file.

For external files, this region also displays the file path to the text file.
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Running Scripts</h3>
The most notable keystroke is <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-P</kbd> which makes the content of the buffer
being parsed by the internal Python interpreter built into Blender.
Before going on it is worth noticing that Blender comes with a fully functional Python interpreter built-in,

and with a lots of Blender-specific modules,
as described in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/advanced/scripting/index.html"><span class="blue">Scripting &amp; Extending Blender</span></a> section.
<h2></h2><
span id="bpy-types-consoleline"></span><h2>Python Console</h2>
The Python Console is a quick way to execute commands,
with access to the entire Python API, command history and auto-complete.

The command prompt is typical for Python 3.x,
the interpreter is loaded and is ready to accept commands at the prompt <code><span class="sapphire">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>.
The Python Console is a good way to explore the possibilities of Blender built-in Python.
The Python Console can be used to test small bits of Python code which can then be pasted into larger scripts.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Aliases</h3>
Some variables and modules are available for convenience:
<code><span class="sapphire">C</span></code>: Quick access to <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context</span></code>.
<code><span class="sapphire">D</span></code>: Quick access to <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.data</span></code>.
<code><span class="sapphire">bpy</span></code>: Top level Blender Python API module.
<h3>First Look at the Console Environment</h3>

To check what is loaded into the interpreter environment, type <code><span class="sapphire">dir()</span></code>
at the prompt and execute it.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_python-console_dir.png" />
<h3>Auto Completion</h3>
Now, type <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.</span></code> and then press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> and you will see the Console
auto-complete feature in action.

<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_python-console_completion.png" />
You will notice that a list of sub-modules inside of <code><span class="sapphire">bpy</span></code> appear. These modules encapsulate all
that we can do with Blender Python API and are very powerful tools.
Lets list all the contents of <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.app</span></code> module.
Notice the green output above the prompt where you enabled auto-completion.
What you see is the result of auto completion listing.

In the above listing all are module attributed names,
but if you see any name end with <code><span class="sapphire">(</span></code>, then that is a function.
We will make use of this a lot to help our learning the API faster.
Now that you got a hang of this, lets proceed to investigate some of modules in <code><span class="sapphire">bpy</span></code>.
<h3>Before Tinkering with the Modules</h3>
If you look at the 3D View in the default Blender scene,

you will notice three objects: Cube, Light and Camera.
All objects exist in a context and there can be various modes under which they are operated upon.
At any instance, only one object is active and there can be more than one selected object.
All objects are data in the blend-file.
There are operators/functions that create and modify these objects.
For all the scenarios listed above (not all were listed, mind you…)

the <code><span class="sapphire">bpy</span></code> module provides functionality to access and modify data.
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>bpy.context</h3>
Note
For the commands below to show the proper output, make sure you have selected object(s) in the 3D View.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_python-console_bpy-context.png" />

<dt><code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context.mode</span></code></dt><dd>Will print the current 3D Viode (Object, Edit, Sculpt, etc.).</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context.object</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context.active_object</span></code></dt><dd>Wgive you access to the active object in the 3D View.</dd>
Change the X location to a value of 1:
<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre>
Move the object from previous X location by 0.5 unit:

<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span>
</pre>
Change the X, Y, Z location:
<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
Change only the X, Y components:

<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">xy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
The data type of object's location:
<span></span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
Now that is a lot of data that you have access to:

<span></span><span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context.selected_objects</span></code></dt><dd>Will give access tlist of all selected objects.</dd>
Type this and then press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd>:
<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">selected_objects</span>
</pre>

To print out the name of first object in the list:
<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">selected_objects</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>
The complex one… But this prints a list of objects not including the active object:
<span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">selected_objects</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>

<h3>bpy.data</h3>
<code><span class="sapphire">bpy.data</span></code> has functions and attributes that give you access to all the data in the blend-file.
You can access following data in the current blend-file:
objects, meshes, materials, textures, scenes, screens, sounds, scripts, etc.
That is a lot of data.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_python-console_bpy-data.png" />

<h3>bpy.ops</h3>
The tool system is built around the concept of operators.
Operators are typically executed from buttons or menus but can be called directly from Python too.
See the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.html">bpy.ops</a>
API documentation for a list of all operators.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Info Editor</span></h2>

The Info editor logs executed operators, warnings and error messages.
Logged reports can be selected by clicking on them.
To select multiple reports, hold down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_outliner_interface.png" />
<span class="orange">The Outliner editor.</span>
The Outliner is a list that organizes data in the blend-file,
i.e. the scene data, Video Sequencer data, or anything that gets stored in a blend-file.
The Outliner can be used to:

View the data in the scene.
Select and deselect objects in the scene.
Hide or show an object in the scene.
Enable or disable selection (to make an object “unselectable” in the 3D Viewport).
Enable or disable the rendering of an object.
Delete objects from the scene.

Unlink data (equivalent to pressing the X button next to the name of a data-block).
Manage collections in the scene.
Each row in the Outliner shows a data-block. You can <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> click the disclosure triangle to
the left of a name to expand the current data-block and see what other data-blocks it contains.
Holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> when clicking on the disclosure triangle will expand child data-blocks recursively.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> Clicking and dragging along disclosure triangles will expand or collapse multiple data-blocks.

<h2>Selecting and Activating</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_outliner_selection.png" />
<span class="orange">Selected data-blocks with the Cube active.</span>
Selection is done with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> (and/or the <a href="#context-menu">context menu</a>, see below) on the row of
a data-block outside the name/icon area. Single selections will also activate the data-block.
The rows of selected data-blocks are highlighted blue, with the active data-block highlighted in a lighter blue.

Clicking in empty space below the list of data-blocks will deselect all.
Note
By default, selecting data-blocks in the Outliner will select the respective objects,
bones, and sequences in the 3D View and Sequencer.
Selections in the 3D View and Sequencer will be synced to each Outliner.
To disable selection syncing, turn off the toggle in the <a href="#filter">filter</a> popover.

Children of a data-block can also be selected by clicking the icon that is displayed to
the right of the parent data-block's name.
<h3>Selecting Multiple Data-Blocks</h3>
Extend the selection one data-block at a time using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-LMB</kbd>.
Each data-block added to the selection this way will be made the active data-block.
Select a range of elements from the active element using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd>.

To select a range without deselecting the previous selection, use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl-LMB</kbd>.
A click and drag from any location in the Outliner other than a name or icon will begin a box selection.
Use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> to add and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> to subtract from existing selections with box select.
Box select can also be started with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">B</kbd>.
To select all items use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>; <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-A</kbd> will deselect all items.
The keyboard arrow keys can be used to navigate and select in the Outliner.

Keyboard selection and navigation starts from the active data-block,
but does not change the active data-block.

<h2>Toggling Interaction Modes</h2>
Selecting some data-blocks with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> will toggle into the relevant interaction mode.
For example, selecting the mesh data of the cube will select the cube and enter Edit Mode.
Selecting the data-block again will toggle back into Object Mode.

If the data-block type supports multi-editing,
you can use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> to add/remove objects from the Edit Mode.
<h2>Relations Management</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_outliner_relations.png" />
<span class="orange">Linking objects to a collection.</span>
Data-blocks can be dragged and dropped to manage data relations in the Outliner.

To begin a drag and drop, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> click and drag from the name or icon of a data-block.
Objects can be moved to collections by dropping on the name or contents of a collection.
To link an object to a collection, hold <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while dropping.
To set parent-child relations between objects, drop an object onto another object
while holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>.
Note

Drag and drop will attempt to operate on the entire selection. Selected data-blocks
that are incompatible with the operation will remain unmodified.
<h2>Context Menu</h2>
Show the context menu for a data-block with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> on the icon or name.
Depending on the type of the preselected data-block(s), you will have all or part of the following options:
<dt>Copy/Paste</dt><dd>Copy/pastes selected data-blocks.</dd>

<dt>Delete</dt><dd>Deletes the selected data-block.</dd>
<dt>Select, Select Hierarchy, Deselect</dt><dd>Add object to current stion without making it the active one.</dd>
<h3>Collections</h3>
Collections are a way Blender uses to organize scenes.
Collections contain objects and everything thing else in a scene.
They can include collections themselves and are fully recursive.

Note
Some data-block types will not have a context menu at all!
<h2>Restriction Columns</h2>
The following toggles, in the right side of the Outliner editor,
are available for collections, objects, bones, modifiers and constraints.
By default only the temporary viewport visibility is enabled.

The other options can be enabled in the Restriction Toggles option in the Outliner <a href="#filter">filter</a>.
Holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> sets or unsets the value to all its child collections or objects.
Holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> isolates the object or collection, so they are the only ones with its value set.
<dt>Visibility (eye icon)</dt><dd>Toggles the visibility of the objec the 3D View.</dd>
<dt>Enable Collection (checkbox)</dt><dd>Exclude the collection from the view layer.
This is not really a restriction column. It is shown besides the collection icon.</dd>

Note
The following options need to first be enabled in the Outliner filter.
<dt>Selectability (mouse cursor icon)</dt><dd>This is useful for if you have placed something in the scene
and do not want to accidentally select it when working on something else.</dd>
<dt>Rendering (camera icon)</dt><dd>This will still keep the object visible in the scene, but it will be ignored by the renderer.
Usually used by support objects that help modeling and animation yet do not belong in the final images.</dd>

<dt>Global Viewport Visibility (screen icon)</dt><dd>This will still render the object/collection, but it will be ignored by all the viewports.
Often used for collections with high-poly objects that need to be instanced in other files.</dd>
<dt>Holdout (collection only)</dt><dd>Mask out objects in collection fview layer – Cycles only.</dd>
<dt>Indirect Only (collection only)</dt><dd>Objects in these collectionly contribute to indirect light – Cycles only.</dd>
<h2>Header</h2>

The Properties editor shows and allows editing of many active data, including the active scene and object.
<h2>Tabs</h2>
The Properties editor has several categories, which can be chosen via tabs (the icons column to its left).
Each tab regroups properties and settings of a data type, and is documented in its own manual sections, linked below.

<h3>Active Tool and Workspace Settings</h3>
This first tab contains settings for the active <a href="3dview/toolbar/index.html"><span class="blue">tool</span></a> (in the 3D View)
and the current <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/window_system/workspaces.html"><span class="blue">workspace</span></a>.
<h3>Scene</h3>
These tabs contain settings for the active scene.

<h3>Object Data</h3>
The main tab of that category (often the only one) always has the same name, Object Data,
but its icon will change based on the actual type of the active object.

Geometry Objects:

<h2>Header</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_properties-editor_top.png" />

<span class="orange">The header of the Properties editor.</span>
In the header of this editor, a list of icons and text items shows the owner of the properties being edited,
together with some dependency context if needed.
In the example above, the material “Material” is used by the active object “Cube”.
By toggling on the pin icon to the right, Blender can be told to display in that editor
only the currently shown data-block's properties, disregarding further selection changes.

Toggle off that pin to switch back to default behavior, showing active data-block's properties.
<h2><span class="greenbut">File Browser</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_file-browser_editor.png" />
<span class="orange">The File Browser.</span>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The File Browser is used in all the file-related operations. These include:

Opening and saving blend-files.
Browsing inside other blend-files, when appending or linking data-blocks,
see <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/linked_libraries/index.html"><span class="blue">Linked Libraries</span></a>.
Importing from/exporting to other file formats.
Picking new locations for existing file paths (images, videos, fonts…).
The most common way to use this editor is through modal operators (like opening or saving a blend-file).

It will appear maximized, waiting for the operation to complete,
and then close and return to the former screen layout.
Note
You can always select several entries in the File Browser,
the last selected one is considered as the active one.
If the calling operation expects a single path (like e.g. the main blend-file Open one),

it will get that active item's path, other selected ones will just be ignored.
You can also keep the File Browser open, as any other editor type, to browse through the file system.
The main purpose of this is to be able to drag-and-drop media files:
Images into the <a href="3dview/index.html#editors-3dview-index"><span class="std std-ref">3D Viewport</span></a> (to set as background or apply as material texture).
Media files into the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/index.html#editors-sequencer-index"><span class="std std-ref">Video Editing</span></a>.
<h2>Header</h2>

<dt>Display type</dt><dd>Controls how files are displayed.
Short List only shows file names.
Long List adds date/time and size information.

<dt>Show hidden <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">H</kbd></dt><dd>Shows hidden files (starting with a <code><span class="sapphire">.</span></code>).</dd>
<h3>View Menu</h3>
<dt>Display size</dt><dd>The size of the thumbnails, or the widt the columns.</dd>
<dt>Recursion</dt><dd>The number of directory levels to show at once in a flat way.
None (default, shows only the current directory content)

Blend File (the whole content of a blend-file, only available when linking or appending data-blocks)
One Levels
Two Levels
Three Levels
Hint
Showing several levels of directories at once can be handy to e.g. see your whole collection of textures,

even if you have arranged them in a nice set of directories to avoid having hundreds of
files in a single place.
In the Append/Link case, showing the content of the whole blend-file will allow you
to link different types of data-blocks in a single operation.
Warning
The more levels you show at once, the more time it will take to list them all

(typically, it will be exponential, showing three levels at once
may take three orders of magnitude more time to be fully listed).
</dd>
<h3>File Filtering</h3>
To the right of the header are the filtering options.
The first “funnel” button controls whether filtering is enabled or not.

<dt>File Types</dt><dd>Filters files by categories, like folders, blenles, images, etc.</dd>
<dt>Data-Block Types</dt><dd>When appending or linking, you can also fr by data-block categories, like scenes, animations, materials, etc.</dd>
<dt>Search field</dt><dd>Filter items by name.
The wildcard <code><span class="sapphire">*</span></code> will match anything, e.g. <code><span class="sapphire">bl*er</span></code> will match both <code><span class="sapphire">blender</span></code> and <code><span class="sapphire">blogger</span></code>.
There is always an implicit wildcard at start and end of the search string,
so <code><span class="sapphire">blender</span></code> will also match <code><span class="sapphire">test_blender_file.blend</span></code>.

This field can also be used to filter some specific file extension (e.g. <code><span class="sapphire">.png</span></code> will list all PNG files).</dd>
<h2>File Region</h2>
<dt>File Path</dt><dd>Text field for the current folder path.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> will auto-complete an existing path.
If you type a non existing directory path, you will be prompted to create that new directory.</dd>
<dt>File Name</dt><dd>Text field to edit the file name and extension.

<h2>Toolbar</h2>
The left region is divided in two areas, Bookmarks on top, and the Operator panel at the bottom.
<h3>Bookmarks</h3>

The top one displays different ways to quickly access some directories, in four <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/list_presets.html#ui-list-view"><span class="std std-ref">lists</span></a>.
Clicking on one of the shortcut entries will immediately navigate to that folder.
<dt>Volumes</dt><dd>Contains all OS-defined available volumes, e.g. ds or network mounts.</dd>
<dt>System</dt><dd>Contains OS-defined common directories, like the muser folder…</dd>
<dt>Favorites</dt><dd>Contains folders that you want to be able to access often without having to navigate to them in the File Browser.
To the right of that list are buttons to perform basic management actions on your favorites,

e.g. add/remove an entry, move it up or down in the list, etc.</dd>
<dt>Recent</dt><dd>Contains recently accessed folders.
The <code><span class="sapphire">X</span></code> button to the right allows you to fully erase this list.
You can control how many folders appear in this list with the Recent Files number field
of the <a href="preferences/save_load.html#prefs-save-load"><span class="std std-ref">Save &amp; Load</span></a> tab in the Preferences.</dd>
<h3>Operator Panel</h3>

Shows the options of the calling operator.
Besides common actions listed below, many import/export add-ons will also expose their options there.
<dt>Open, Save, Save As Blender File</dt><dd>See <a class="reference inal" href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/blend/open_save.html"><span class="blue">Opening &amp; Saving</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Open, Replace, Save As Image</dt><dd>See <a class="reference inter href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/media/image_formats.html"><span class="blue">Supported Graphics Formats</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Link/Append from Library</dt><dd>See <a class="reference internhref=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/linked_libraries/index.html"><span class="blue">Linked libraries</span></a>.</dd>
For the common option:

<dt>Relative Path</dt><dd>See <a hrefps://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/blend/open_save.html#files-blend-relative-paths"><span class="std std-ref">Relative Paths</span></a>.</dd>
<h2>Main Region</h2>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<dt>Entering a Directory</dt><dd>A single <kbd class="kbd docutilseral notranslate">LMB</kbd> click on a directory enters it.</dd>
<dt>Parent Directory <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">P</kbd></dt><dd>Takes you up one level of directory.</dd>
<h4>File Drop</h4>

You can also drag &amp; drop a file or directory from your local file explorer into the Blender File Browser.
This will relocate it to the directory of the dropped file, and the file will be selected.
<h3>Selection</h3>
<dt>Select</dt><dd>Both <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> clicks work.
Holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> will extend the items selection.</dd>
<dt>(De)select All <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd></dt><dd>Toggles selecting all files.</dd>

<dt>Dragging</dt><dd>Dragging with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal noslate">LMB</kbd> starts a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/selecting.html#tool-select-box"><span class="std std-ref">box selection</span></a>.</dd>
<h4>Arrow Keys</h4>
It is also possible to select/deselect files by “walking” through them using the arrow keys:
Just using an arrow key, the next file in the chosen direction will be selected and all others deselected.
Holding down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> while doing this does not deselect anything so it extends to the selection,
plus it allows to deselect files by navigating into a block

of already selected ones (minimum two files in sequence).
Holding down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Ctrl</kbd> further selects/deselects all files in between.
If no file is selected, the arrow key navigation selects the first or last file in the directory,
depending on the arrow direction.
If you select a directory and hit <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd>, you will go into that directory
(and highlighting ‘parent' <code><span class="sapphire">..</span></code> entry will bring you up one level).

<h3>File Management</h3>
<dt>Delete Files <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Delete</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">X</kbd></dt><dd>De the currently selected files.</dd>
<dt>Rename <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-LMB</kbd></dt><dd>Can be used on a file or directory to rename it.</dd>
Warning
Be careful, there is no way to undo those actions!
<h3>Previews</h3>

<h2>Scenes</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Scenes are a way to organize your work.
Each blend-file can contain multiple scenes, which share other data such as objects and materials.
Scene management and library appending/linking are based on Blender's
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/index.html"><span class="blue">Library and Data System</span></a>,

so it is a good idea to read that manual page first,
if you are not familiar with the basics of that system.
You can select and create scenes with the Scene data-block menu
in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/window_system/topbar.html"><span class="blue">Topbar</span></a>.
<h2>Controls</h2>

<dt>New</dt><dd>Creates an empty scene with default values.</dd>
<dt>Copy Settings</dt><dd>Creates an empty scene, but also copies
the settings from the active scene into the new one.</dd>
<dt>Linked Copy</dt><dd>This option creates a new scene with the same settings and contents as the active scene.
However, instead of copying the objects,
the new scene contains links to the collections in the old scene.

Therefore, changes to objects in the new scene will result in the same
changes to the original scene, because the objects used are literally the same.
The reverse is also true.</dd>
<dt>Full Copy</dt><dd>Using this option, nothing is shared.
This option creates a fully independent scene with copies of the active scene's contents.
Every object in the original scene is duplicated, and a duplicate,

private copy of its object-data is made as well.</dd>
Note
To choose between these options,
it is useful to understand the difference between Object and Object Data.
The choices for adding a scene, therefore, determine just how much of this information will be
copied from the active scene to the new one, and how much will be shared (linked).

</dd>
<dt>Delete <code><span class="sapphire">X</span></code></dt><dd>You can delete the current scene by clicking the X

You can <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/object/editing/duplication.html#data-system-linked-libraries-make-link"><span class="std std-ref">link</span></a> any object from one scene to another.

<dt>Camera</dt><dd>Used to select which camera is used as the active camera.

You can also set the active camera in the 3D View with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-0</kbd>.</dd>
<dt>Background Scene</dt><dd>Allows you to use a scene as a background,
this is typically useful when you want to focus on animating the foreground for example,
without background elements getting in the way.
This scene can have its own animation, physics simulations, etc,
but you will have to select it from the Scene data-block menu, if you want to edit any of its contents.

Sets can themselves have a background set (they're recursively included).
So you can always make additions to existing scenes by using them as a background
to a newly created scene where your additions are made.
Tip
This can also be used in combination with <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/object/editing/duplication.html#data-system-linked-libraries-make-link"><span class="std std-ref">Linking to a Scene</span></a>,

practically this is the same as Metric just without unit names.</dd>
<dt>Metric</dt><dd>Use the metric unit system in this scene.</dd>
<dt>Imperial</dt><dd>Use the imperial unit system in this scene.</dd></dd>
<dt>Unit Scale</dt><dd>Scale factor to use when converting between internal units and values displayed in the user interface.

This can be changed when modeling at microscopic or astronomical scales.
Note
This only influences the values displayed in the user interface
and not how things behave internally. For example, physics simulations
don't take the unit scale into account.
</dd>

<dt>Separate Units</dt><dd>When using Metric or Imperial, display properties as multiple values.
For example, <code><span class="sapphire">2.285m</span></code> will become <code><span class="sapphire">2m</span> <span class="sapphire">28.5cm</span></code>.</dd>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
The geometry of a scene is constructed from one or more objects.
These objects can range from lights to illuminate your scene, basic 2D and 3D shapes to fill it with models,
armatures to animate those models, to cameras to take pictures or make video of it all.

Each Blender object type (mesh, light, curve, camera, etc.) is composed from two parts:
an Object and Object Data (sometimes abbreviated to “ObData”):
<dt>Object</dt><dd>Holds information about the position, rotation ande of a particular element.</dd>
<dt>Object Data</dt><dd>Holds everything else. For example:
<dt class="field-odd">Meshes</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">Store geometry, material list, vertex groups, etc.</dd>

<dt class="field-even">Cameras</dt>
<dd class="field-even">Store focal length, depth of field, sensor size, etc.</dd>
Each object has a link to its associated <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/properties_editor.html#properties-data-tabs"><span class="std std-ref">object-data</span></a>,
and a single object-data may be shared by many objects.</dd>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Object Origin</span></h2>
Each object has an origin point. The location of this point determines where
the object is located in 3D space. When an object is selected, a small circle appears,

denoting the origin point. The location of the origin point is important
when translating, rotating or scaling an object.
See <a href="editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index.html"><span class="blue">Pivot Points</span></a> for more.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Selecting</span></h2>
Selection determines which elements will be the target of our actions.
Selections work on the current scene visible objects.
Blender has advanced selection methods. Both in Object Mode and in Edit Mode.

<h2>Selections and the Active Object</h2>
Blender distinguishes between two different states of selection:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/scene-layout_object_selecting_color.png" />
<span class="orange">Active object in yellow, selected object in orange, and unselected object in black.</span>
In Object Mode the last (de)selected item is called the “Active Object”
and is outlined in yellow (the others are orange).

There is at most one active object at any time.
Many actions in Blender use the active object as a reference (for example linking operations).
If you already have a selection and need to make a different object the active one,
simply reselect it with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd>.
All other selected objects are just selected. You can select any number of objects.
In order to change a property or to perform an operation on all selected objects (bones, and sequencer strips)

hold <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>, while confirming.
<h2>Select Menu</h2>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
In Blender, objects are not directly part of the scenes.
Instead, they all get stored in a main database (basically the blend-file).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/scene-layout_collections_introduction_database-preview.png" />

<span class="orange">The blend-file and its stored data.</span>
From there they are referenced into as many Scenes as you would like to see them.
When they are stored in a scene, they are part of a so-called scene collection.
So ultimately all the scene objects belong to this special collection.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/scene-layout_collections_introduction_scene-collection.png" />
<span class="orange">The scene collection.</span>

<h2>Collections</h2>
While the scene collection contains all the Scene's objects,
the user can also make their own collections to better organize these objects.
It works like a Venn diagram, where all the objects are part of the scene collection,
but can also be part of multiple collections.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/scene-layout_collections_introduction_venn-diagram.png" />

<span class="orange">Venn diagram.</span>
The result is a clear and flexible way to arrange objects together on the Scene level.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/scene-layout_collections_introduction_scene-organization.png" />
<span class="orange">Scene organization.</span>
<h2>Naming and Nesting</h2>
Collections can be named and sorted hierarchically.

Just like folders can have subfolders in any operating system,
collections can have nested collections too.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/scene-layout_collections_introduction_collections-nested.png" />
<span class="orange">Nested collections.</span>
For example: a house collection can contain a bedroom collection,
which in turn contains a furniture collection referencing a bed, a cabinet and other objects.

<h2
>Collections</h2>
There can be many objects in a scene: A typical stage scene consists of furniture, props,
lights, and backdrops.
Blender helps you keep everything organized by allowing you to group like objects together.
Objects can be grouped together without any kind of transformation relationship (unlike parenting).

Collections are used to just logically organize your scene,
or to facilitate one-step appending or linking between files or across scenes.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>

The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, materials and lights.
In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling.
Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape
of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.
<h2>Modes</h2>
Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types

of modeling <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/modes.html"><span class="blue">modes</span></a>.
Since modes are not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.
Switching between modes while modeling is common.
Some tools may be available in more than one mode while others may be unique to a particular mode.
<h3>Edit Mode</h3>
Edit mode is the main mode where modeling takes place.

Edit mode is used to edit the following types of objects:
Meshes
Curves
Surfaces
Metaballs
Text objects

Lattice
You can only modify the mesh of the objects you are editing.
To modify other objects you can leave Edit Mode, select another object and enter Edit Mode,
or use <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/modes.html#dview-multi-object-mode"><span class="std std-ref">Multi-Object Editing</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>

Mesh Modeling typically begins with
a <a href="primitives.html"><span class="blue">Mesh Primitive</span></a> shape (e.g. circle, cube, cylinder…).
From there you might begin editing to create a larger, more complex shape.
<h2>Modeling Modes</h2>
The 3D View has three principal modes that allow for the creation,
editing and manipulation of the mesh models.

Each of the three modes have a variety of tools. Some tools may be found in one or more of the modes.
Modes that used for modeling:
<dt>Object Mode</dt><dd>Supports basic operations such as object creation,
joining objects, managing shape keys, UV/color layers.</dd>
<dt>Edit Mode</dt><dd>Used for the majority of mesh editing operations></dd>
<dt>Sculpt Mode</dt><dd>Instead of dealing with individual mesh elements,

support sculpting with brushes (not covered in this chapter).</dd>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Structure</span></h2>
With meshes, everything is built from three basic structures:
vertices, edges and faces.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_structure_example.svg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_structure_example.svg" width="600px" /></a>

<span class="orange">Example of mesh structure.</span>
<h2>Vertices</h2>
The most elementary part of a mesh is the vertex (vertices plural) which is a single point or position in 3D space.
Vertices are represented in the 3D Viewport in Edit Mode as small dots.
The vertices of and object are stored as an array of coordinates.
Tip

Do not mistake the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/origin.html"><span class="blue">object origin</span></a> for a vertex.
It may look similar, but it is bigger and cannot be selected.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_structure_cube-example.png" />
<span class="orange">The vertex is labeled as “A”; the object's origin dot is labeled as “B”.</span>
<h2>Edges</h2>
An edge always connects two vertices by a straight line.

The edges are the “wires” you see when you look at a mesh in wireframe view.
They are usually invisible on the rendered image. They are used to construct faces.
<h2>Faces</h2>
Faces are used to build the actual surface of the object.
They are what you see when you render the mesh.
If this area does not contain a face,

it will simply be transparent or non-existent in the rendered image.
A face is defined as the area between either three (triangles), four (quadrangles) or more (n-gons) vertices,
with an edge on every side. The faces are often abbreviated to tris, quads &amp; n-gons.
Triangles are always flat and therefore easy to calculate. On the other hand,
quadrangles “deform well” and are therefore preferred for animation and subdivision modeling.

<h2>Normals</h2>
In geometry, a normal is a direction or line that is perpendicular to something,
typically a triangle or surface but can also be relative to a line,
a tangent line for a point on a curve, or a tangent plane for a point on a surface.

<span class="orange">Example mesh with Auto Smooth enabled.</span>
<h4>Advanced Smooth Shading &amp; Sharp Edges</h4>

By default in Blender, with basic normal computing behavior, a sharp edge is always defined
as an edge being either non-manifold, or having at least one of its faces defined as flat.
Enabling the Auto Smooth setting adds an extra parameter to define a sharp edge,
the Angle threshold between two neighbor faces, above which the edge will always be considered as sharp.
Auto Smooth also enables Custom Split Normals handling, which can be either defined (and edited)
as a <a href="editing/normals.html"><span class="blue">mesh data layer</span></a>, or generated on the fly by modifiers.

In any case, when a mesh gets custom normals, they always supersede the default ones computed by Auto Smooth.
Sharp edges may still be used by the custom normals modifiers to compute their normals,
depending on their settings.
<h3>Custom Split Normals</h3>
Custom Split Normals is a way to tweak/fake shading by pointing normals towards
other directions than the default, auto-computed ones. It is mostly used in game development,

where it helps counterbalance some issues generated by low-poly objects
(the most common examples are low-poly trees, bushes, grass, etc. and the ‘rounded' corners).
Blender supports custom normals on a ‘smooth fan' base, defined as a set of neighbor face corners
sharing the same vertex and ‘linked' by smooth edges. This means you can have normals per face corners,
per a set of neighbor face corners, or per vertex.
<h4>Enabling Custom Split Normals</h4>

<dt class="field-even">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><span class="saddlebrown">Mesh ‣ Normals ‣ Split</span></dd>
Enables custom split normals.

Also, any of the custom normal editing tools (see below) will, as a convenience,
enable custom normals if they are not already enabled.
Note
This has the side effect of enabling <a href="#auto-smooth"><span class="std std-ref">Auto Smooth</span></a>, as that is necessary to use custom normals.
Once you have custom normals, the angle threshold of the Auto Smooth behavior is disabled –
all non-sharp-tagged edges will be considered as smooth, disregarding the angle between their faces.

<dt class="field-odd">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-N</kbd></dd>
There are a number of tools for editing custom split normals.
The custom normal mesh edit tools can affect all normals (the default), or only selected ones.
To select a custom normal associated with a particular vertex and face:
Make the element selection mode both Vertex and Face (use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> to enable the second one).

Select one or more vertices, then select a face.
This can be repeated to select more vertices and a different face and so on.
It is easiest to see the effect of these tools if you turn on
the Edit Mode Overlays option Display vertex-per-face normals as lines.

<a href="editing/normals.html"><span class="blue">Editing Normals</span></a>.

<h3>Importing Custom Split Normals</h3>
Some tools, particularly those used in <abbr title="Computer-Aided Design">CAD</abbr>, tend to generate irregular geometry
when tessellating their objects into meshes (very thin and long triangles, etc.).
Auto-computed normals on such geometry often gives bad artifacts,
so it is important to be able to import and use the normals as generated by the CAD tool itself.
Note

Currently, only the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/addons/import_export/scene_fbx.html"><span class="blue">FBX Importer</span></a> and
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/import_export/alembic.html"><span class="blue">Alembic Importer</span></a> are capable of importing custom normals.
<h2>Topology</h2>
<h3>Loops</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_structure_edge-face-loops.png" />
<span class="orange">Edge and face loops.</span>

Edge and face loops are sets of faces or edges that form continuous “loops” as shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig-mesh-topo-loop"><span class="std std-ref">Edge and face loops.</span></a>.
In the image above, loops that do not end in poles are cyclic (1 and 3).
They start and end at the same vertex and divide the model into two partitions.
Loops can be a quick and powerful tool to work with specific,
continuous regions of a mesh and are a prerequisite for organic character animation.

For a detailed description of how to work with loops in Blender, see:
<a href="selecting.html#modeling-meshes-selecting-edge-loops"><span class="std std-ref">Edge Loop Selection</span></a>.
Note
Note that loops (2 and 4) do not go around the whole model.
Loops stop at so-called poles because there is no unique way to continue a loop from a pole.
Poles are vertices that are connected to either three, five, or more edges. Accordingly,

vertices connected to exactly one, two or four edges are not poles.
Edge Loops
Loops (1 and 2) in Fig. <a href="#fig-mesh-topo-loop"><span class="std std-ref">Edge and face loops.</span></a> are edge loops.
They connect vertices so that each one on the loop has exactly two neighbors that are not on
the loop and placed on both sides of the loop (except the start and end vertex in case of poles).
Edge loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface)

modeling and character animation. When used correctly, they allow you to build models with
relatively few vertices that look very natural when used as subdivision surfaces and
deform very well in animation.
Take Fig. <a href="#fig-mesh-topo-loop"><span class="std std-ref">Edge and face loops.</span></a> in organic modeling as an example: the edge loops follow
the natural contours and deformation lines of the skin and the underlying muscles and
are more dense in areas that deform more when the character moves, for example at the shoulders or knees.

Further details on working with edge loops can be found in
<a href="selecting.html#modeling-meshes-selecting-edge-loops"><span class="std std-ref">Edge Loop Selection</span></a>.
Face Loops
These are a logical extension of edge loops in that they consist of the faces between
two edge loops, as shown in loops (3 and 4) in Fig. <a href="#fig-mesh-topo-loop"><span class="std std-ref">Edge and face loops.</span></a>.
Note that for non-circular loops (4)

the faces containing the poles are not included in a face loop.
Further details on working with face loops can be found in
<a href="selecting.html#modeling-meshes-selecting-face-loops"><span class="std std-ref">Face Loop Selection</span></a>.

A common object type used in a 3D scene is a mesh.
Blender comes with a number of “primitive” mesh shapes that you can start modeling from.
You can also add primitives in Edit Mode at the 3D cursor.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_primitives_all.png" />
<span class="orange">Blender's standard primitives.</span>
Note
Planar Primitives
You can make a planar mesh three-dimensional by moving one or more of the vertices out of its plane
(applies to Plane, Circle and Grid).

A simple circle is often used as a starting point to create even the most complex of meshes.
<h2>Common Options</h2>
These options can be specified in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel,
which appears when the object is created.
Options included in more than one primitive are:
<dt>Generate UVs</dt><dd>Generates a default UV unwrapping of new geometry.

This will be defined in the first UV layer (which will get added if needed).</dd>
<dt>Radius/Size, Align to View, Location, Rotation</dt><dd>See <ass="reference internal" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/types.html#object-common-options"><span class="std std-ref">Common Object Options</span></a>.</dd>
<h2>Plane</h2>
The standard plane is a single quad face, which is composed of four vertices, four edges, and one face.
It is like a piece of paper lying on a table;
it is not a three-dimensional object because it is flat and has no thickness.

Objects that can be created with planes include floors, tabletops, or mirrors.
<h2>Cube</h2>
A standard cube contains eight vertices, twelve edges, and six faces,
and is a three-dimensional object. Objects that can be created out of cubes include dice,
boxes, or crates.
<h2>Circle</h2>

<dt>Vertices</dt><dd>The number of vertices that define the circle orygon.</dd>
<dt>Fill Type</dt><dd>Set how the circle will be filled.
<dt>Triangle Fan</dt><dd>Fill with triangular faces which share a vx in the middle.</dd>
<dt>N-gon</dt><dd>Fill with a single <a class="reference internaref="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-n-gon"><span class="xref std std-term">n-gon</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Nothing</dt><dd>Do not fill. Creates only the outer ring of vertic</dd></dd>
<h2>UV Sphere</h2>

A standard UV sphere is made out of quad faces and a triangle fan at the top and bottom.
It can be used for texturing.
<dt>Segments</dt><dd>Number of vertical segments. Like the Earth's means, going pole to pole.</dd>
<dt>Rings</dt><dd>Number of horizontal segments. These are like the Earth's parallels.
Note
Rings are face loops and not edge loops, which would be one less.

</dd>
<h2>Icosphere</h2>
An icosphere is a polyhedral sphere made up of triangles.
Icospheres are normally used to achieve a more isotropical layout of
vertices than a UV sphere, in other words, they are uniform in every direction.
<dt>Subdivisions</dt><dd>How many recursions are used to define the sphere.

At level 1 the icosphere is an icosahedron, a solid with 20 equilateral triangular faces.
Each increase in the number of subdivisions splits each triangular face into four triangles.</dd>
Note
Subdividing an icosphere raises the vertex count very quickly even with few iterations
(10 times creates 5,242,880 triangles),
Adding such a dense mesh is a sure way to cause the program to crash.

<h2>Cylinder</h2>
Objects that can be created out of cylinders include handles or rods.
<dt>Vertices</dt><dd>The number of vertical edges between the circlesd to define the cylinder or prism.</dd>
<dt>Depth</dt><dd>Sets the starting height of the cylinder.</dd>
<dt>Cap Fill Type</dt><dd>Similar to circle (see above). When set to none, the created object will be a tube.
Objects that can be created out of tubes include pipes or drinking glasses

(the basic difference between a cylinder and a tube is that the former has closed ends).</dd>
<h2>Cone</h2>
Objects that can be created out of cones include spikes or pointed hats.
<dt>Vertices</dt><dd>The number of vertical edges between the circlestip, used to define the cone or pyramid.</dd>
<dt>Radius 1</dt><dd>Sets the radius of the circular base of the cone.</dd>
<dt>Radius 2</dt><dd>Sets the radius of the tip of the cone. Which will create a frustum (a pyramid or cone with the top cut off).

A value of 0 will produce a standard cone shape.</dd>
<dt>Depth</dt><dd>Sets the starting height of the cone.</dd>
<dt>Base Fill Type</dt><dd>Similar to circle (see above).</dd>
<h2>Torus</h2>
A doughnut-shaped primitive created by rotating a circle around an axis.
The overall dimensions can be defined by two methods.

<dt>Operator Presets</dt><dd>Torus preset settings for reuse. Thesesets are stored as scripts in the proper presets directory.</dd>
<dt>Major Segments</dt><dd>Number of segments for the main ring of the torus.
If you think of a torus as a “spin” operation around an axis, this is how many steps are in the spin.</dd>
<dt>Minor segments</dt><dd>Number of segments for the minor ring of the torus.
This is the number of vertices of each circular segment.</dd>
<h3>Torus Dimensions</h3>

<dt>Add Mode</dt><dd>Change the way the torus is defined.
Major/Minor, Exterior/Interior
<dt>Major Radius</dt><dd>Radius from the origin to the center of tross sections.</dd>
<dt>Minor Radius</dt><dd>Radius of the torus' cross section.</dd>
<dt>Exterior Radius</dt><dd>If viewed along the major axis,
this is the radius from the center to the outer edge.</dd>

<dt>Interior Radius</dt><dd>If viewed along the major axis,
this is the radius of the hole in the center.</dd></dd>
<h2>Grid</h2>
A regular quadratic grid which is a subdivided plane.
Example objects that can be created out of grids include landscapes
and organic surfaces.

<dt>X Subdivisions</dt><dd>The number of spans in the X axis.</dd>
<dt>Y Subdivisions</dt><dd>The number of spans in the Y axis.</dd>
<h2>Monkey</h2>
This adds a stylized monkey head to use as a test mesh,
use <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-subdivision-surface"><span class="xref std std-term">Subdivision Surface</span></a> for a refined shape.
This is intended as a test mesh, similar to:

<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot">Utah Teapot</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Bunny">Stanford Bunny</a>.
Hint
History
This is a gift from old NaN to the community and is seen as a programmer's joke or
“Easter Egg”. It creates a monkey's head once you press the Monkey button.

The Monkey's name is “Suzanne” and is Blender's mascot.
Note
Add-ons
In addition to the basic geometric primitives,
Blender has a number of script generated meshes to offer as pre-installed add-ons.
These are available when enabled in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/addons.html"><span class="blue">Preferences</span></a>

(select the Category Add Mesh, then check any desired items).
<h2><span class="greenbut">Selecting</span></h2>
There are many ways to select elements, and it depends on what Mesh Select Mode
you are in as to what selection tools are available.
First we will go through these modes and after that a look is taken at basic selection tools.
<h2>Selection Modes</h2>

<span class="orange">Edit Mode selection buttons.</span>
In Edit Mode there are three different selection modes.
You can enter the different modes by selecting one of the three buttons in the header.
<dt>Vertices</dt><dd>In this mode vertices are shown as points.
Selected vertices are displayed in orange, unselected vertices in black,
and the active or last selected vertex in white.</dd>

<dt>Edges</dt><dd>In this mode the vertices are not shown.
Instead the selected edges are displayed in orange,
unselected edges black, and the active or last selected edge in white.</dd>
<dt>Faces</dt><dd>In this mode the faces are displayed with a selection point in the middle which is used for selecting a face.
Selected faces and their selection point are displayed in orange,
unselected faces are displayed in black, and the active or last selected face is highlighted in white.</dd>

When using these buttons, you can make use of modifier keys, see: <a href="#switching-select-mode">Switching Select Mode</a>.
Almost all tools are available in all three mesh selection modes.
So you can Rotate, Scale, Extrude, etc. in all modes.
Of course rotating and scaling a single vertex will not do anything useful
(without setting the pivot point to another location),
so some tools are more or less applicable in some modes.

See Fig. <a href="#fig-mesh-select-intro-selection-modes"><span class="std std-ref">Selection modes.</span></a> for examples of the different modes.
<h4>Multiple Selection Modes</h4>
By holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> when selecting a selection mode,
you can enable multiple Selection Modes at once.
This allows you to quickly select Vertices/Edges/Faces,
without first having to switch modes.

<h3>Switching Select Mode</h3>
When switching modes in an “ascendant” way (i.e. from simpler to more complex), from
Vertices to Edges and from Edges to Faces,

the selected parts will still be selected if they form a complete element in the new mode.
For example, if all four edges in a face are selected,
switching from Edges mode to Faces mode will keep the face selected.
All selected parts that do not form a complete set in the new mode will be unselected.

Hence, switching in a “descendant” way (i.e. from more complex to simpler),
all elements defining the “high-level” element (like a face) will be selected
(the four vertices or edges of a quadrangle, for example).

<h4>Expand/Contract Selection</h4>
By holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> when selecting a higher selection mode,
all elements touching the current selection will be added,
even if the selection does not form a complete higher element.
Or contracting the selection when switching to a lower mode.

Select geometry connected to already selected elements.

This is often useful when a mesh has disconnected, overlapping parts,
where isolating it any other way would be tedious.
To give more control, you can also enable delimiters in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel,
so the selection is constrained by seams, sharp edges, materials or UV islands.
With Pick Linked you can also select connected geometry directly under the cursor,
using the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd> shortcut to select or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-L</kbd> to deselect linked.

This works differently in that it uses the geometry under the cursor instead of the existing selection.

<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-LMB</kbd>, or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Alt-LMB</kbd> for modifying existing selection.</dd>
Holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> while selecting an edge selects a loop of edges that are connected in
a line end-to-end, passing through the edge under the mouse pointer.
Holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Alt</kbd> while clicking adds to the current selection.
Edge loops can also be selected based on an existing edge selection,
using either <span class="saddlebrown">Select ‣ Edge Loop</span>.

Note
Vertex mode
In Vertex select mode, you can also select edge loops, by using the same hotkeys,
and clicking on the edges (not on the vertices).

<span class="orange">Longitudinal and latitudinal edge loops.</span>

The left sphere shows an edge that was selected longitudinally. Notice how the loop is open.
This is because the algorithm hit the vertices at the poles and is terminated
because the vertices at the pole connect to more than four edges. However,
the right sphere shows an edge that was selected latitudinally and has formed a closed loop.
This is because the algorithm hit the first edge that it started with.
<h4>Edge Loops (All Boundaries)</h4>

All boundary edges can be selected by performing a second loop select action on a boundary edge.
This can be useful for selecting boundaries for meshes that include triangles and n-gons,
where loop select would not otherwise select the full boundary.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_selecting_edge-boundary-loops.png" />

<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-LMB</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Alt-LMB</kbd> for modifying existing selection.</dd>
In face select mode, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> while selecting an edge selects a loop of

faces that are connected in a line end-to-end, along their opposite edges.
In vertex select mode,
the same can be accomplished by using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt</kbd> to select an edge,
which selects the face loop implicitly.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_selecting_face-loops.png" />
<span class="orange">Face loop selection.</span>

This face loop was selected by clicking with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-LMB</kbd> on an edge,
in face select mode.
The loop extends perpendicular from the edge that was selected.

<span class="orange"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> versus <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt</kbd> in vertex select mode.</span>
A face loop can also be selected in Vertex select mode.

Technically <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-LMB</kbd> will select an Edge Ring,
however, in Vertex select mode, selecting an Edge Ring implicitly
selects a Face Loop since selecting opposite edges of a face implicitly selects
the entire face.
<h3>Edge Ring</h3>

<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-LMB</kbd></dd>

In Edge select mode, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt</kbd>
while selecting an edge (or two vertices) selects a sequence of edges that are not connected,
but on opposite sides to each other continuing along a <a href="structure.html"><span class="blue">face loop</span></a>.
As with edge loops, you can also select edge rings based on current selection,
using either <span class="saddlebrown">Select ‣ Select Loops ‣ Edge Rings</span>.
Note

Vertex mode
In Vertex select mode, you can use the same hotkeys when clicking on the edges (not on the vertices),
but this will directly select the corresponding face loop…
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_selecting_edge-ring.png" />
<span class="orange">A selected edge loop, and a selected edge ring.</span>
In Fig. <a href="#fig-mesh-select-advanced-loop-ring"><span class="std std-ref">A selected edge loop, and a selected edge ring.</span></a> the same edge was clicked on,

but two different “groups of edges” were selected, based on the different tools.
One is based on edges during computation and the other is based on faces.
Note
Convert Selection to Whole Faces
If the edge ring selection happened in Edge Select Mode, switching to Face Select Mode will erase the selection.
This is because none of those faces had all its (four) edges selected,

just two of them.
Instead of selecting the missing edges manually or by using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Alt-</kbd> twice,
it is easier to first switch to Vertex Select Mode, which will kind of “flood” the selection.
A subsequent switch to Face Select Mode will then properly select the faces.

Select Loop Inner-Region selects all faces that are inside a closed loop of edges.

While it is possible to use this operator in Vertex and Face selection modes, results may be unexpected.
Note that if the selected loop of edges is not closed,
then all connected edges on the mesh will be considered inside the loop.

Select Boundary Loop does the opposite of Select Loop Inner-Region,
based on all regions currently selected, it selects only the edges at the border(contour) of these islands.
It can operate in any select mode, but when in Face mode it will switch to Edge select mode after running.

All this is much more simple to illustrate with examples:

<span class="orange">Select Boundary Loop does the opposite and forces into Edge Select Mode.</span>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<h3>Dense Meshes</h3>
Selecting dense meshes with X-Ray disabled, has a limitation where dense meshes may not have

all the elements selected.
When selecting regions with Box, Circle and Lasso select, vertices may overlap each other causing
some vertices not to be selected.
This is a limitation with the current selection method, you may workaround this by zooming in or enabling X-Ray.
<h3>N-Gons in Face Select Mode</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_meshes_selecting_face-mode-ngon-visual-problem.png" />

<span class="orange">N-gon face having its center dot inside another face.</span>
As already noted, in X-Ray and Wireframe mode faces are marked with a dot in the middle.
With n-gons that can lead in certain cases to a confusing display.
The example shows the center dot of the U-shaped n-gon being inside of the oblong face inside the “U”.
It is not easy to say which dot belongs to which face (the orange dot in the image is the object origin).

Mesh analysis is useful for displaying attributes of the mesh,

that may impact certain use cases.
The mesh analysis works in Edit Mode and Solid Viewport shading.
It shows areas with a high value in red, and areas with a low value in blue.
Geometry outside the range is displayed gray.
Currently the different modes target 3D printing as their primary use.
<h2>Overhang</h2>

<h2>Intersections</h2>
Another common cause of problems for printing are intersections between surfaces,

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Curves and <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/surfaces/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Surfaces</span></a> are particular types of Blender objects.

They are expressed by mathematical functions (interpolation)
rather than linear interpolation between a series of points.
Blender offers both <a href="structure.html#curve-bezier"><span class="std std-ref">Bézier</span></a> and <a href="structure.html#curve-nurbs"><span class="std std-ref">NURBS</span></a>.
Both Bézier curves and NURBS curves and surfaces are defined in terms of a set of “control points”
(or “control vertices”) which define a “control polygon”.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_curves_introduction_logo.png" />

<span class="orange">Blender logo made from Bézier curves.</span>
Both Bézier and NURBS curves are named after their mathematical definitions, and
choosing between them is often more a matter of how they are computed behind the scenes
than how they appear from a modeler's perspective.
Bézier curves are generally more intuitive because they start and end at the control points that you set,
but NURBS curves are more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve.

The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that curves are defined by
less data and so can produce results using less memory and storage space at modeling time.
However, this procedural approach to surfaces can increase demands at render time.
Certain modeling techniques, such as
<a href="properties/geometry.html"><span class="blue">extruding a profile along a path</span></a>,
are possible only using curves. On the other hand, when using curves,

<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/meshes/editing/introduction.html"><span class="blue">mesh editing</span></a> may be a better modeling option.
Bézier curves are the most commonly used curves for designing letters or logos.
They are also widely used in animation, both as for objects to move along (see constraints below)
and as <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html"><span class="blue">F-Curves</span></a>
to change the properties of objects as a function of time.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Structure</span></h2>

<h2>Splines</h2>
Splines are a substructure of curves and are the individual elements that make curve objects.
A curve object can be composed of several different splines,
just like mesh objects can have different discontinuous meshes under the same object.
A spline defines the shape of the curve and can be transformed by altering its <a href="#control-points">Control Points</a>.
Splines come in three distinct types, which are described in <a href="#spline-types">Spline Types</a>.

Each spline type has a slightly different algorithm for computing how bends in the spline are represented.
Splines have their own separate properties from curves and can be altered
by selecting the spline in Edit Mode and using
the <a href="properties/active_spline.html"><span class="blue">Active Spline</span></a> panel.
<h3>Control Points</h3>
Similar to meshes splines have control points or vertices.

Control points connect to other control points to form splines.
Control points can be <a href="selecting.html"><span class="blue">selected</span></a>
and transformed to alter the resulting shape of the spline.
See also
<a href="editing/index.html"><span class="blue">Curve Editing</span></a>
<h2>Spline Types</h2>

<h3>Poly</h3>
Poly splines are the most simple spline type as they do not
interpolate the shape of the curve between control points.
Poly Curves are used when <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/introduction.html#bpy-ops-object-convert"><span class="std std-ref">converting meshes to curves</span></a>.
Because they do not interpolate the shape,
Poly splines are able to give an accurate representation of the original mesh object.

This is the primary use case of splines, most of the time <a href="#bezier">Bézier</a> or <a href="#nurbs">NURBS</a>
splines are used instead; both of which interpolate the shape and give smooth results.
<h3>Bézier</h3>
The main elements used in editing Bézier curves are the control points and handles.
A segment (the actual curve) is found between two control points.
The handles define the curvature of the segment.

In the image below,
the control points can be found in the middle of the pink line,
while the handles comprise the extensions from the control point.
The arrows visualize the normals of the curve, which indicate i.e.
the direction and the tilt.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_curves_structure_control-points-handles.png" />

<span class="orange">Bézier Curve in Edit Mode.</span>
<h4>Handle Types</h4>
There are four Bézier curve handle types.
They can be accessed by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">V</kbd> and selecting from the list that appears,
or by pressing the appropriate hotkey combination.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_curves_structure_bezier-handle-types.png" />

<span class="orange">Bézier Curve Handle Types.</span>
<dt>Automatic (yellow handles)</dt><dd>This handle has a completely automatic length and direction
which is set by Blender to ensure the smoothest result.
These handles convert to Aligned handles when moved.</dd>
<dt>Vector (green handles)</dt><dd>Both parts of a handle always point to the previous handle or the next handle which allows
you to create curves or sections thereof made of straight lines or with sharp corners.

<dt>Aligned (purple handles)</dt><dd>These handles always lie in a straight line,
and give a continuous curve without sharp angles.</dd>
<dt>Free (black handles)</dt><dd>The handles are independent of each o.</dd>
<h3>NURBS</h3>
N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines.

One of the major differences between Bézier objects and NURBS objects is that Bézier curves
are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an approximation of a circle,
whereas a NURBS circle is an exact circle.
NURBS theory can be a very complicated topic. For an introduction,
please consult the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS">Wikipedia page</a>.
NURBS spline control points are different than other spline types because they have a special weight property.

This weight property controls how much influence the control point has on the surface.
This weight should not be confused with the <a href="editing/transform_panel.html#curves-weight"><span class="std std-ref">Goal Weight</span></a>,
which is used only for soft body simulations.
The NURBS control point weight can be adjusted in the W number field of
the <a href="editing/transform_panel.html"><span class="blue">Transform panel</span></a>.
Note

If all the control points have the same Weight then each effectively cancels each other out.
It is the difference in the weights that cause the curve to move
towards or away from a control point.

When adding curves there are some common options like other <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/types.html#object-common-options"><span class="std std-ref">Objects</span></a>.
In Object/Edit Mode, the Add Curve menu, provides five different curve primitives:
<h2>Bézier Curve</h2>
Adds an open 2D Bézier curve with two control points.
<h2>Bézier Circle</h2>
Adds a closed, circle-shaped 2D Bézier curve (made of four control points).

<h2>NURBS Curve</h2>
Adds an open 2D <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-nurbs"><span class="xref std std-term">NURBS</span></a> curve, with four control points, with Uniform knots.

Adds a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-nurbs"><span class="xref std std-term">NURBS</span></a> open 3D curve made of five aligned control points,

with Endpoint knots and the Curve Path setting enabled.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Selecting</span></h2>
This page discusses specific selecting tools for curve objects in Edit mode.
The Curve Edit more also uses the general select tools used which are described
in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/selecting.html"><span class="blue">interface section</span></a>.
Curve selection in Edit Mode has fewer options than with meshes.

Mainly this is, because there is only one selectable element type, the control points
(no select mode needed here…). These points are a bit more complex than simple vertices,
however, especially for Bézier curves, as there is the central vertex, and its two handles…
The basic tools are the same as with <a href="../meshes/selecting.html"><span class="blue">meshes</span></a>,
so you can select a simple control point with the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>,
add to current selection with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd>, Box Select <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">B</kbd>, and so on.

One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main central vertex,
the two handles are automatically selected too, so you can move it as a whole,
without creating an angle in the curve. However, when you select a handle,
only this vertex is selected, allowing you to modify this control vector…
Note that, unlike mesh edges, you cannot directly select a segment. Instead,
select all of the control points that make up the segment you want to edit.

These operators will toggle the selection of the first or last control point(s) of the curve(s)

(e.g. when using it as path…).
<h2>Select Next/Previous</h2>

</dd>
These operators will select the next or previous control point(s),

based on the current selection
(i.e. the control points following or preceding the selected ones along the curve).
In case of a cyclic curve, the first and last points are not considered as neighbors.

Their purpose, based on the currently selected control points, is to reduce or enlarge this selection.
<dt>More</dt><dd>For each selected control point, select all its linked points (i.e. one or two…).
</dd>
<dt>Less</dt><dd>For each selected control point, if all points linked to this point are selected, keep this one selected.

Otherwise, deselect it.
</dd>
This implies two points:
When all control points of a curve are selected, nothing will happen
(as for Less, all linked points are always selected, and of course, More cannot add any).
Conversely, the same goes when no control points are selected.

Second, these tools will never “go outside” of a curve
(they will never “jump” to another curve in the same object).

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Curves are 2D objects, and surfaces are their 3D extension.
Note however, that in Blender, you only have NURBS surfaces,
no Bézier (you have the Bézier knot type, though; see below),

nor polygonal (but for these, you have meshes!).
Even though curves and surfaces share the same object type (with texts also…),
they are not the same thing; for example,
you cannot have in the same object both curves and surfaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_surfaces_introduction_nurbs-surface.png" />
<span class="orange">NURBS surface in Edit Mode.</span>

As surfaces are 2D, they have two interpolation axes, U (as for curves) and V.
It is important to understand that you can control the interpolation rules (knot, order, resolution)
independently for each of these two dimensions
(the U and V fields for all these settings, of course).
You may ask yourself “but the surface appears to be 3D, why is it only 2D?”.
In order to be 3D, the object needs to have “Volume”, and a surface, even when it is closed,

does not have volume; it is infinitely thin.
If it had a volume the surface would have a thickness (its third dimension). Hence,
it is only a 2D object, and has only two interpolation dimensions or axes or coordinates
(if you know a bit of math, think of non-Euclidean geometry – well,
surfaces are just non-Euclidean 2D planes…). To take a more “real-world” example,
you can roll a sheet of paper to create a cylinder; well, even if it becomes a “volume”,

the sheet itself will remain a (nearly…) 2D object!
In fact, surfaces are very similar to the results you get when

<h2>Visualization</h2>
There is nearly no difference from NURBS curves,
except that the U direction is indicated by yellow grid lines,

<h2><span class="greenbut">Structure</span></h2>
Many of the concepts from <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/introduction.html"><span class="blue">curves</span></a>,

especially <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/structure.html#curve-nurbs"><span class="std std-ref">NURBS</span></a> ones,
carry directly over to NURBS surfaces,
such as control points, Order, Weight, Resolution, etc.
Here we will just talk about the differences.
It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves and NURBS surfaces:
the first one has one dimension, the latter has two.

Blender internally treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely differently. There are
several attributes that separate them but the most important is that a NURBS curve has
a single interpolation axis (U) and a NURBS surface has two interpolation axes (U and V).
However, you can have “2D” surfaces made of curves
(using the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/properties/geometry.html"><span class="blue">extrusion tools</span></a>,
or, to a lesser extent, the filling of closed 2D curves). And you can have “1D” curves made of surfaces,

like a NURBS surface with only one row (either in U or V direction) of control points produces only a curve…
Visually you can tell which is which by entering Edit Mode and looking at the 3D View header:
either the header shows Surface or Curve as one of the menu choices. Also,
you can <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/properties/geometry.html"><span class="blue">extrude</span></a> a whole NURBS surface curve to create a surface,
but you cannot with a simple NURBS curve.
<h2>Control Points, Rows and Grid</h2>

Control points for NURBS surfaces are the same as for NURBS curves. However,
their layout is quite constraining. The concept of “segment” disappears,
replaced by “rows” and the overall “grid”.
A “row” is a set of control points forming one “line” in one interpolation direction
(a bit similar to <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/meshes/structure.html#modeling-mesh-structure-edge-loops"><span class="std std-ref">edge loops</span></a> for meshes).
So you have “U rows” and “V rows” in a NURBS surface.

The key point is that all rows of a given type (U or V) have the same number of control points.
Each control point belongs to exactly one U row and one V row.
All this forms a “grid”, or “cage”, the shape of which controls the shape of the NURBS surface.
A bit like a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/lattice.html"><span class="blue">lattice</span></a>…
This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to a NURBS surface;
you have to add a whole U or V row at once

(in practice, you will usually use the Extrude tool, or perhaps the Duplicate one, to add those…),
containing exactly the same number of points as the others. This also means that you will only
be able to “merge” different pieces of surfaces if at least one of their rows matches together.
<h2>Weight</h2>
Similar to <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/structure.html#curve-nurbs"><span class="std std-ref">NURBS Splines</span></a> NURBS Surface control points have a weight property.
This weight property controls how much influence the control point has on the surface.

This weight should not be confused with the <a href="editing/transform_panel.html#surface-goal-weight"><span class="std std-ref">Goal Weight</span></a>,
which is used only for soft body simulations.
The NURBS control point weight can be adjusted in the W number field of
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/editing/transform_panel.html"><span class="blue">Transform panel</span></a>.
In Fig. <a href="#fig-surface-intro-weight"><span class="std std-ref">One control point with a weight of 5.</span></a> a single control point, labeled “C”,
has had its Weight set to 5.0 while all others are at their default of 1.0.

As you can see, that control point pulls the surface towards it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_surfaces_structure_weight.png" />
<span class="orange">One control point with a weight of 5.</span>
Note
If all the control points have the same Weight then each effectively cancels each other out.
It is the difference in the weights that cause the surface to move

towards or away from a control point.
<h3>Preset Weights</h3>
NURBS can create pure shapes such as circles, cylinders, and spheres
(note that a Bézier circle is not a pure circle). To create pure circles, spheres,
or cylinders, you must set to specific values the weights of the control points.
This is not intuitive, and you should read more on NURBS before trying this.

To create a sphere with 2D surfaces, its the same principle as with a 2D circle.
You will note that the four different weights needed for creating a sphere
(1.0, 0.707 = sqrt(0.5), 0.354 = sqrt(2)/4, and 0.25).

The Surface Edit more also uses the general select tools used which are described
in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/selecting.html"><span class="blue">interface section</span></a>.
Surface selection in Edit Mode is very similar to
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/curves/selecting.html"><span class="blue">NURBS curve selection</span></a>.

The basic tools are the same as with <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/meshes/selecting.html"><span class="blue">meshes</span></a>,
so you can select a simple control point with an <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>-click,

This implies two points:

First, when all control points of a surface are selected, nothing will happen
(as for Less, all linked points are always selected, and of course, More cannot add any).
Conversely, the same goes when no control point is selected.
Second, these tools will never “go outside” of a surface
(they will never “jump” to another surface in the same object).

Meta objects are implicit surfaces,
meaning that they are not explicitly defined by vertices (as meshes are)
or control points (as surfaces are): they exist procedurally.
Meta objects are literally mathematical formulas that are calculated on-the-fly by Blender.

A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid mercurial,
or clay-like forms that have a “rounded” shape. Furthermore,
when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin to interact with one another.
They “blend” or “merge”, as water droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way,
makes them very handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid simulation).
If they subsequently move away from one another, they restore their original shape.

Each of these is defined by its own underlying mathematical <a href="structure.html"><span class="blue">structure</span></a>,
and you can at any time switch between them using the Active Element panel.
Typically Meta objects are used for special effects or as a basis for modeling.
For example, you could use a collection of metas to form the initial shape of your model and
then convert it to a mesh for further modeling or sculpting. Meta objects are also very efficient for ray tracing.
Warning

Names of Meta objects are very important, as they define <a href="editing.html#meta-ball-object-families"><span class="std std-ref">families</span></a>,
and only objects within a same family interact with each other.
Unlike other object types, even edition (transformations) in Object Mode will affect the generated geometry
within the edited families.
<h2>Visualization</h2>
In Object Mode, the calculated mesh is shown, along with a black “selection ring”.

<span class="orange">Meta Ball in Edit mode.</span>
In Edit Mode (Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-example"><span class="std std-ref">Meta Ball in Edit mode.</span></a>), a meta is displayed as a mesh
(either shaded or as black wireframe, but without any vertex of course),
with two colored circles: a red one for selection (pink when selected),
and a green one for a direct control of the meta's stiffness (light green when active).

Note that except for the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/transform/basics.html#bpy-ops-transform-resize"><span class="std std-ref">scale transformation</span></a>,
having the green circle highlighted is equivalent to having the red one.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Toolbar</span></h2>
Metaball Edit Mode tools:
Note
Some <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../scene_layout/object/toolbar/index.html#object-toolbar-index"><span class="std std-ref">Object Mode</span></a> are also present.

There are no meta-specific editing tools currently.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Structure</span></h2>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
A more formal definition of a meta object can be given as a directing structure which can
be seen as the source of a static field. The field can be either positive or negative and
hence the field generated by neighboring directing structures can attract or repel.

The implicit surface is defined as the surface where the 3D field generated by
all the directing structures assume a given value. For example a meta ball,
whose directing structure is a point, generates
an isotropic (i.e. identical in all directions) field around it and
the surfaces at constant field value are spheres centered at the directing point.
Meta objects are nothing more than mathematical formula that perform logical operations on one another

(AND, OR), and that can be added and subtracted from each other.
This method is also called Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG).
Because of its mathematical nature, CSG uses little memory, but requires lots of processing power to compute.

Blender has five types of metas, each determined by its underlying (or directing) structure.
In Edit Mode, you can change this structure,
either using the relevant buttons in the Active Element panel,

Depending on the structure, you might have additional parameters,
located in both Transform panel and Active Element panel.

<dt>Ball (point, zero-dimensional structure)</dt><dd>This is the simplest meta, without any additional setting. As it is just a point,
it generates an isotropic field, yielding a spherical surface
(this is why it is called Meta Ball or Ball in Blender).</dd>
<dt>Capsule (straight line, one-dimensional structure)</dt><dd>This is a meta which surface is generated by the field produced by a straight line of a given length.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Editing</span></h2>
In addition to having several meta objects in a same family,

you can also have several meta primitives in a single object (just add some more while in Edit Mode).
Each will be an element, with its own shape, editing rings (in the viewport), and settings.
<h2>Active Element</h2>

<span class="orange">Active Element panel.</span>
These settings apply only to the selected meta element.
<dt>Type</dt><dd>Changes the <a class="reference internaref="primitives.html"><span class="blue">primitive shape</span></a> of the meta object.</dd>

<dt>Stiffness</dt><dd>Controls the influence range for individual meta elements, unlike Influence Threshold
which controls the influence for the entire <a href="#meta-ball-object-families"><span class="std std-ref">meta family</span></a>.
This essentially defines how sensitive a meta is to being affected by other metas.
With a low stiffness, the meta will begin to deform from further away.
A higher value means the meta needs to be close to another one to begin merging.
The Stiffness is visualized by the green ring and can be selected and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/transform/basics.html#bpy-ops-transform-resize"><span class="std std-ref">scaled</span></a>

to also changes the Stiffness value.
To be visible, the Stiffness must be slightly larger than the Threshold value.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_stiffness.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_stiffness.png" style="width: 450px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">The left meta ball, has a smaller Stiffness value than the right one.</span>
</dd>
<dt>Radius</dt><dd>Controls the physical size of the metaball.

This works the same as scaling the metaball in Object Mode.
The Radius is visualized by the white ring and can be selected and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/transform/basics.html#bpy-ops-transform-resize"><span class="std std-ref">scaled</span></a>
to also changes the Radius value.</dd>
<dt>Negative</dt><dd>Controls whether the influence is positive or negative.
A positive influence is defined as an attraction,
meaning that the meshes will stretch towards each other as the rings of influence intersect.

The opposite effect would be a negative influence where the objects repel each other.
Note
If a metaball has Negative influence the meta is not visible in the 3D Viewport,
only the surrounding circles are shown.

and then reveal what was hidden. This is very handy for cleaning your views up a bit.

Note
Hiding a meta does not only hide it, but also disables it from the meta computation,
which will affect the final geometry.
The two red and green rings always remain visible in Edit Mode,
as well as the select circle in Object Mode.

<h2>Conversion</h2>

To convert the meta to a real mesh, use <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/introduction.html#object-convert-to"><span class="std std-ref">Convert To</span></a> in Object Mode.
<h2>Object Families</h2>
A “family” is a way to regroup several meta objects,
producing something very similar to having several metas inside the same object.
It is defined by the left part of an object's name (the one before the first dot).
Remember, an object's name is the one in the Object Name field, in most panels,

not the Metaball Name field, which is the meta data-block's name…
For example, the family part of “MetaPlane.001” is <code><span class="sapphire">MetaPlane</span></code>.
Each meta object in the same “family” is associated with one another as discussed below.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_family.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_family.png" style="width: 450px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Metaball family.</span>
Families of metas are controlled by a base meta object which is identified by

an object name without a dot in it. For example,
if we have three metas called <code><span class="sapphire">MetaThing</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">MetaThing.001</span></code>,
<code><span class="sapphire">MetaThing.round</span></code>, the base meta object would be <code><span class="sapphire">MetaThing</span></code>.
The base meta object determines the basis, the resolution, the threshold,
and the transformations. It also has the material and texture area.
In a way, the base meta is the “owner” of the other metas in the family

(i.e. it is as if the other metas were “included” or joined into the base one).
Hint
When working with multiple scenes,
take care naming your meta objects so the base is always in the same scene as other metas.
Failing to do so will give confusing behaviors (like invisible meta objects).
<h2>Examples</h2>

Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-base"><span class="std std-ref">Meta ball base.</span></a> shows the base meta labeled “B”.
The other two Meta objects are children. Children's selection rings are always black,
while the group's mesh is orange. Because the metas are grouped,
they form a unified mesh which can always be selected by selecting the mesh of any meta in the group.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_base-example.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_base-example.png" style="width: 450px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Meta ball base.</span>

For example, in Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-base"><span class="std std-ref">Meta ball base.</span></a>, only the lower sphere (the parent) has been selected,
and you see that both the parent's mesh and all of the children's meshes are now highlighted.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_base-example-scale.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_metas_editing_base-example-scale.png" style="width: 450px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Scaling the “base”.</span>
The base meta object controls the polygonalization (mesh structure) for the group, and
as such, also controls the polygonalization for the children (non-base) metas.

If we transform the base meta, the children's polygonalization changes.
However, if we transform the children, the polygonalization remains unchanged.
Hint
This discussion of “polygonization” does not mean that the various meshes do not deform
towards or away from each other (meta objects always influence one another in the usual way,
within a same family).

Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure changes only when the base object transforms.
For example, if you scale the base, the children's mesh structure changes.
In Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-scale"><span class="std std-ref">Scaling the “base”.</span></a>, the base has been scaled down,
which has the effect of scaling the mesh structure of each of the children. As you can see,
the children's mesh resolution has increased, while the base decreased.
The children did not change size!

One way to see the underlying mathematical structure is to lower the Resolution,
increase the Threshold and set the Stiffness (see below)
a fraction above the Threshold. Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-intro-underlying"><span class="std std-ref">Underlying structure.</span></a> is a meta cube
with the above mentioned configuration applied as follows:
Resolution of 0.410, Threshold of 5.0 and Stiffness a fraction above at 5.01.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
You can clearly see the underlying cubic structure that gives the meta cube its shape.
<h2>Influence Threshold</h2>

Influence Threshold defines how much a meta's surface “influences” other metas.
It controls the field level at which the surface is computed.
The setting is global to a group of Meta objects.
As the threshold increases, so does the influence that each meta has on each other.
There are two types of <a href="editing.html#meta-ball-editing-negative-influence"><span class="std std-ref">influence</span></a>: positive or negative.
<h2>Update</h2>

While transforming metas (move, scale, etc.), you have four “modes” of visualization,
located in the Update buttons group of the Metaball panel:
<dt>Always</dt><dd>fully display the meta during transformations.</dd>
<dt>Half</dt><dd>During transformations, display the meta at half Wiresize resolution.</dd>
<dt>Fast</dt><dd>Do not display meta during transformations.</dd>
<dt>Never</dt><dd>Never show meta mesh (not a very recommended option the meta is only visible at render time!).</dd>

This should help you if you experience difficulties (metas are quite computationally intensive…),
but with modern computers, this should not happen, unless you use many metas,
or very high resolutions…

Text objects contain some text, and are in the same object type family as curves and surfaces ones,
as fonts are vectorial data (they are made of curves).
Blender uses a “Font System” to manage mapping letter codes to geometry representing them in 3D Views.
This font system has its own built-in font, but it can use external fonts too,
including PostScript Type 1, OpenType and TrueType fonts.
And moreover, it can use any objects existing in the current blend-file as letters.

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_texts_introduction_examples.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_texts_introduction_examples.jpg" style="width: 460px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">An example of an extruded text.</span>
Text objects allow you to create and render 2D or 3D text,
with various advanced layout options, like justifying and frames.
By default, letters are just flat filled surfaces, exactly like any closed 2D curve.
But, just like curves, you can extrude them,

and apply <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modifiers/introduction.html"><span class="blue">modifiers</span></a> to them
(e.g. to make them <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modifiers/deform/curve.html"><span class="blue">follow a curve</span></a>).
Tip
You can convert a text object, either to a curve, or directly to a mesh,
using <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/introduction.html#object-convert-to"><span class="std std-ref">Convert To</span></a> in Object Mode.
Note

A maximum of 50,000 characters is allowed per text object. However,
be forewarned that the more characters a single text object has,
the slower the object will respond interactively.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Selecting &amp; Editing</span></h2>
Editing text is quite different from other object types in Blender, and happens mainly in two areas.
First, the 3D View, where you type your text, and have a few shortcuts, e.g. for applying

styles (see <a href="properties.html#modeling-text-character"><span class="std std-ref">Font</span></a>) – note however, that most Blender hotkeys you know
in Edit Mode do not exist for texts. The second place is the Properties editor, especially the Font tab.
<h2>Selecting &amp; Cursor</h2>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_texts_selecting-editing_cursor.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_texts_selecting-editing_cursor.png" style="width: 340px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Text in Edit mode.</span>
In Edit Mode, your text has a white cursor, and as in any text editor,

it determines where new chars will be inserted.
<dt>Next/Previous Character <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Left</kbd>/ <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Right</kbd></dt>You can move the cursor with the arrow keys.</dd>
<dt>Next/Previous Word <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Left</kbd>/ <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Right</kbd></dt><dd>To move the cursor on a word's boundary.</dd>
<dt>Line Begin/End <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Home</kbd>/ <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">End</kbd></dt><dd>Move thrsor to the beginning and end of a line respectively.</dd>
<dt>Next/Previous Line <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Up</kbd>/ <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Down</kbd></dt><ddjump between lines.</dd>
<dt>Next/Previous Page <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">PageUp</kbd>/ <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">PageDown</kbd></dd>To jump back/forward ten lines at a time.</dd>

Hold <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> while using the arrow keys to select a part of the text.
You can use it to specify different materials, the normal/bold/italic style…
<h2>Editing</h2>
The menu of the 3D View header offers few options. You have no transform nor mirror tools, and so on.
<h3>Basic</h3>
Editing text objects is similar to using a standard text editor but is not as

full-featured and has some differences:
<dt>Exit Edit Mode</dt><dd><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> does not insert a tab character in the text,
but rather enters and exits Edit Mode, as with other object types.</dd>
<dt>Copy <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-C</kbd></dd>To copy text to the buffer, use the shortcut or the matching entry in the Edit menu.</dd>
<dt>Cut and Copy <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-X</kbd></dt><dd>To cut and copy text to the buffer, use the shortcut or the hing entry in the Edit menu.</dd>
<dt>Paste <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-V</kbd></dt><dd>To paste text from the buffer, use the shortcut or the matching entry in the Edit menu.</dd>

<dt>Delete all text <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Backspace</kbd></dt><dd>Completely erase or delete all text.</dd>
The text buffer is in sync with the desktop clipboard.
But if it is used within Blender the text formatting will be copied as well.
For other ways of inserting a text, see <a href="#inserting-text">Inserting Text</a> below.
<h3>Special Characters</h3>

<dd class="field-even"><span class="saddlebrown">Edit ‣ Special Characters</span></dd>
This is a limited character map to insert characters which aren't available from the keyboard.
Many other special characters can be “composed”, see <a href="#accent-characters">Accent Characters</a> below.

If you need others, you will have to copy-paste them from an external editor or character map program.
<h3>Accent Characters</h3>
Many special characters (such as accented chars, which are not directly available on your keyboard)
can be “composed” using a combination of two other characters. To do so,
type the main char, press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-Backspace</kbd>,
and then press the desired “modifier” to produce the special character.

<h3>Inserting Text</h3>
You can insert text in two ways: from the internal text buffer
(as described above), or from a text file.
To load text from a text file, use the <span class="saddlebrown">Text ‣ Paste File</span> tool.
This will bring up a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/file_browser.html"><span class="blue">File Browser</span></a> for navigating to a valid UTF-8 file.
As usual, be careful that the file does not have too many characters,

as interactive response will slow down.
<h3>Setting Case</h3>
You can change the text case by selecting it then clicking the To Upper or
To Lower in the Toolbar.
<h3>Font Style</h3>

To apply the Bold / Italics / Underline / Small Caps attribute to a set of characters,
you either turn on the related setting prior to typing characters,
or highlight (select) some existing text, and then toggle desired style from the menu.
Warning
Blender's Bold and Italic buttons do not work the same way as in other applications,
as they also serve as placeholders for you to load up other fonts manually,

see <a href="#loading-and-changing-fonts">Loading and Changing Fonts</a> below.
<h3>Loading and Changing Fonts</h3>
Blender comes with a built-in font by default that is displayed in
each of the four font style data-block menus.
The built-in font is always present and shows in this list as “Bfont”.
The data-block menu contains a list displaying the currently loaded fonts.

Select one for each font style.
To load a different Font, click one of the Load buttons
in the Font panel and navigate to a font file.
The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/file_browser.html"><span class="blue">File Browser</span></a> will give all valid fonts a capital “F” icon.
If you select a font that is unsupported by Blender, you will get the error <code><span class="sapphire">Not</span> <span class="sapphire">a</span> <span class="sapphire">valid</span> <span class="sapphire">font</span></code>.
Note

Location of Fonts on Unix
Fonts are typically located under <code><span class="sapphire">/usr/lib/fonts</span></code>, or some variant like <code><span class="sapphire">/usr/lib/X11/fonts</span></code>,
but not always. They may be in other locations as well,
such as <code><span class="sapphire">/usr/share/local</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">/usr/local/share</span></code>, and possibly related sub-trees.
Remember that the same font will be applied to all chars with same style in a text,
but that a separate font is required for each style.

For example, you will need to load an Italics font in order to make characters or words italic.
Once the font is loaded you can apply that font “Style” to the selected characters or the whole object.
In all, you would need to load a minimum of four different types of fonts to represent each style
(Normal, Italics, Bold, Bold &amp; Italics).
It is important to understand, that Blender does not care what font
you load for “normal”, “bold”, etc., styles.

This is how you can have up to four different fonts in use in the same text,
but you have to choose between different styles of a same font, or different fonts.
Blender has a number of typographic controls for changing the style and layout of text,
found in the Font panel.

<h3>Converting Text Objects</h3>
<h4>Converting to Text Object</h4>
Using an existing text data-block, you can convert it to an object from the Text editor's header,
select <span class="saddlebrown">Edit ‣ Text to 3D Object</span>,
One Object or One Object per Line depending on your needs.
It is also possible to paste from the clipboard or a file from the Edit menu, while editing 3D text.

<h4>Converting to a Mesh or Curve</h4>
In Object Mode, it is possible to convert a text object to a mesh or curve one, see <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/introduction.html#object-convert-to"><span class="std std-ref">Convert To</span></a>.
Tip
The topology of the result is usually a bit messy,
so it may be useful to use a Limited Dissolve deletion,
or apply a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modifiers/generate/remesh.html"><span class="blue">Remesh modifier</span></a> at a low threshold, to clean up your mesh.

<dd class="field-even"><span class="saddlebrown">Properties editor ‣ Materials</span></dd>

Each character can have a different Material index in order to have different materials
on different characters.
You can assign indices either as you type, or after by selecting blocks of text and
clicking on the Assign button in the Materials panel.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Text Layout</span></h2>
Text in Blender can be laid out in some relatively advanced ways,
defining columns or blocks of text, using different alignments, and so on.
Those features are similar in concept to what you can find in <abbr title="DeskTop Publishing">DTP</abbr> software
(like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a>), although at a very basic level currently.

<h3>Spacing</h3>
<dt>Character Spacing</dt><dd>A factor by which space between each character (kerning) is scaled in width.
In Edit Mode in the 3D View, you can also control individual kerning

Text boxes (or frames) allow you to distribute the text among rectangular areas within a single text object.
An arbitrary number of freely positionable and re-sizable text frames are allowed per text object.

The text flows continuously from the lowest-numbered frame to the highest-numbered frame with text
inside each frame word-wrapped.
It flows between frames when a lower-numbered frame cannot fit any more text.
If the last frame is reached, text overflows out of it (by default, see options below).

<dt>Object Font</dt><dd>Allows individual objects to be used to render fonts, you can create/model your own complex font inside Blender!

This field is used to select the objects prefix name (object “family”) to be used
to locate the individual characters used for typing.
This is quite a complex process, so here are detailed steps to follow:
Create the font characters, each character can be any object type (mesh, curve, etc.).
They must all have a name following the naming schema:
“common prefix” followed by the “character name” (e.g. “ft.a”, “ft.b”, etc.).

For the text object, enable
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/verts.html"><span class="blue">Instancing Vertices</span></a>.
In the Font tab, fill the Object Font field with the “common prefix” of your “font” objects.
Now, each time a character in your text matches the suffix part of a “font” object's name,
this object is duplicated on this character.
Note

The objects are duplicated so that their center is positioned at
the lower right corner of the corresponding characters.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Empties</span></h2>
The “empty” is a single coordinate point with no additional geometry.
Because an empty has no volume and surface, it cannot be rendered.
Still it can be used as a handle for many purposes.
<h2>Selecting &amp; Editing</h2>
An empty can only be edited in Object Mode, which includes its transformation and parenting properties.

For other tools see the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/index.html"><span class="blue">Object section</span></a>.
<dt>Apply Scale <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-A</kbd></dt><dd>While empties don't exactly have any object data attached to them which can be used for supporting
“true” apply scale (i.e. with non-uniform scaling), they do have Display Size which controls how
large the empties are displayed (before scaling). This works by taking the scale factor on the most-scaled axis,
and combines this with the existing empty Display Size to maintain the correct dimensions on that axis.</dd>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Empties can serve as transform handles. Some examples of ways to use them include:

Parent object for a group of objects
An empty can be parented to any number of other objects.
This gives the user the ability to control a group of objects easily, and without affecting a render.
Target for constraints
An empty can also be used as a target for normal, or bone constraints.
This gives the user far more control; for instance,

a rig can easily be set up to enable a camera to point towards an empty using the Track to constraint.
Array offset
An empty can be used to offset an Array Modifier,
meaning complex deformations can be achieved by only moving a single object.

Modifiers are automatic operations that affect an object's geometry in a non-destructive way.
With modifiers, you can perform many effects automatically that would otherwise be too tedious to do manually
(such as subdivision surfaces) and without affecting the base geometry of your object.
They work by changing how an object is displayed and rendered, but not the geometry which you can edit directly.
You can add several modifiers to a single object to form <a href="#the-modifier-stack">The Modifier Stack</a>
and Apply a modifier if you wish to make its changes permanent.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_modifiers_introduction_menu.png" />
<span class="orange">Modifiers menu.</span>
They can be added to the active object using the Add Modifier drop-down menu at the top of their properties tab.
New modifiers are always added at the bottom of the <a href="#modifier-stack"><span class="std std-ref">stack</span></a> (i.e. will be applied last).
There are four types of modifiers:
<dt>Modify</dt><dd>These are tools similar to the Deform ones (see below),

however, they usually do not directly affect the geometry of the object,
but some other data, such as vertex groups.</dd>
<dt>Generate</dt><dd>These are constructive/destructive tools that will affect the whole <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-topology"><span class="xref std std-term">topology</span></a> of the mesh.
They can change the general appearance of the object, or add new geometry to it…</dd>
<dt>Deform</dt><dd>Unlike Generate ones above, these only ch the shape of an object, without altering its topology.</dd>
<dt>Simulate</dt><dd>Those represent <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/physics/index.html"><span class="blue">physics simulations</span></a>. In most cases, they are automatically added to

the modifiers stack whenever a Particle System or Physics simulation is enabled. Their only role is to define
the position in the modifier stack from which is taken the base data for the simulation they represent.
As such, they typically have no attributes, and are controlled by settings exposed in
separate sections of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/properties_editor.html"><span class="blue">Properties editor</span></a>.</dd>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_modifiers_introduction_panel-layout.png" />

<span class="orange">Panel layout (Subdivision Surface as an example).</span>
Each modifier's interface shares the same basic components, see Fig. <a href="#fig-modifiers-panel-layout"><span class="std std-ref">Panel layout (Subdivision Surface as an example).</span></a>.
At the top is the panel header.
The icons each represent different settings for the modifier (left to right):

<dt>Apply as Shape Key</dt><dd>Stores the result of that modifier in a new relative <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/shape_keys/introduction.html"><span class="blue">shape key</span></a>.
This is only available with modifiers that do not affect the topology (typically, Deform modifiers only).
Note
Even though it should work with any geometry type that supports shape keys,
currently it will only work with meshes.

</dd>
<dt>Copy</dt><dd>Creates a duplicate of the modifier just below currene in the stack.</dd>
Warning
Applying a modifier that is not first in the stack will ignore the stack order
(it will be applied as if it was the first one), and may produce undesired results.
Below this header, all of the options unique to each modifier will be displayed.

<h3>The Modifier Stack</h3>
Modifiers are a series of non-destructive operations which can be applied on top of an object's geometry.
They can be applied in just about any order the user chooses.
This kind of functionality is often referred to as a “modifier stack”
and is also found in several other 3D applications.
In a modifier stack the order in which modifiers are applied has an effect on the result.

Fortunately modifiers can be rearranged easily by clicking the convenient up and down arrow icons.
For example, the image below shows <a href="generate/subdivision_surface.html"><span class="blue">Subdivision Surface</span></a>
and <a href="generate/mirror.html"><span class="blue">Mirror</span></a> modifiers that have switched places.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Common Modifier Options</span></h2>
Some options are commonly used by many modifiers, and share the same behavior across all of those.
In particular, many offer ways to precisely mask and weight their effect on a vertex basis
(using either vertex groups and/or textures).
<h2>Vertex Group</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_modifiers_common-options_vertex-group.png" />
<span class="orange">Typical modifier Vertex Group options.</span>
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/meshes/properties/vertex_groups/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Vertex Groups</span></a> are an easy way to control
which vertices are affected by a modifier, and to which extent (using their weights).
They are available when modifying meshes or lattices.
Tip

Vertex groups can also be edited and even animated using
the <a href="modify/weight_edit.html#bpy-types-vertexweighteditmodifier"><span class="std std-ref">Vertex Weight modifiers</span></a>.
<dt>Vertex Group</dt><dd>The vertex group name.
Warning
The group is referenced by its name. That means that if you rename it, the link to the renamed vertex group
will be lost by all modifiers using it (their field will turn red),

and you'll have to select the proper group again in all of them.
</dd>
<dt>Invert (double arrow icon)</dt><dd>Invert the influence of thrtex group. Only available in some modifiers.</dd>
<h2>Texture</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/modeling_modifiers_common-options_texture.png" />
<span class="orange">Typical modifier Texture options.</span>

Those options allow to use any kind of image (including parametric ones) to control the modifier's effect.
Most of the time, only the value (grayscale) of the texture is used,
but in some cases (like with some modes of the <a href="deform/displace.html#bpy-types-displacemodifier"><span class="std std-ref">Displace modifier</span></a>),
the whole RGB color components might be exploited.
Tip
Textures can be animated (either using videos, or by animating the mapping coordinates…).

<dt>Texture</dt><dd>The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/materials/legacy_textures/introduction.html"><span class="blue">texture data-block</span></a> to use.
Tip
By clicking on the right-most button of this field (with the settings icon),
you can go directly to the selected texture's settings in the Texture Properties editor.
</dd>
<dt>Texture Coordinates</dt><dd>The texture's coordinates to get each vertex' value:

If the object has no UV coordinates, it falls back to the Local coordinate system.
If this field is blank, but there is a UV map available
(e.g. just after adding the first UV map to the mesh), the currently active UV map will be used.</dd>
Note

Since UV coordinates are specified per face, the UV texture coordinate system currently determines the UV
coordinate for each vertex from the first face encountered which uses that vertex.
Any other faces using that vertex are ignored.
This may lead to artifacts if the mesh has non-contiguous UV coordinates.

Moving the original object will also result in a texture coordinate update.
As such, if you need to maintain a displacement coordinate system while moving the modified object,

consider <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/properties/relations/parents.html#bpy-ops-object-parent-set"><span class="std std-ref">parenting</span></a> the coordinate object to the modified object.

<h2>Selection Masking</h2>
If you have a complex mesh, it is sometimes not easy to paint on all vertices.
Suppose you only want to paint on a small area of the Mesh and keep the rest untouched.
This is where “selection masking” comes into play. When this mode is enabled,

a brush will only paint on the selected vertices or faces.
The option is available from the header of the 3D View
(see icons surrounded by the yellow frame):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_brush_introduction_select.png" />
<span class="orange">You can choose between Face Selection masking (left button)
and Vertex selection masking (right button).</span>

Selection masking has some advantages over the default paint mode:
The original mesh edges are shown, even when modifiers are active.
You can select faces to restrict painting to the vertices of the selected faces.
<h3>Details About Selecting</h3>
The following standard selection operations are supported:
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> – Single faces. Use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-RMB</kbd> to select multiple.

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd> – All faces, also to deselect.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">B</kbd> – Box selection.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">C</kbd> – Circle select with brush.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd> – Pick linked (under the mouse cursor).
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-L</kbd> – Select linked.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-I</kbd> – Invert selection Inverse.

<h3>Vertex Selection Masking</h3>

<dt class="field-odd">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">V</kbd></dd>
In this mode you can select one or more vertices and then paint only on the selection.
All unselected vertices are protected from unintentional changes.

The Face Selection masking allows you to select faces and limit the paint
tool to those faces, very similar to Vertex selection masking.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_brush_introduction_face-select.png" />
<span class="orange">Face Selection masking.</span>
<h3>Hide/Unhide Faces</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_brush_introduction_face-select-hidden.png" />

<span class="orange">Hidden faces.</span>
You also can hide selected faces as in Edit Mode with the keyboard Shortcut <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">H</kbd>,
then paint on the remaining visible faces and finally unhide the hidden faces again by using
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-H</kbd>.
<h3>Hide/Unhide Vertices</h3>
You cannot directly hide selected faces in vertex mask selection mode.

However, you can use a trick:
First go to Face selection mask mode.
Select the areas you want to hide and then hide the faces (as explained above).
Switch back to Vertex Selection mask mode.
Now the vertices belonging to the hidden Faces will remain hidden.
<h3>The Clipping Region</h3>

To constrain the paint area further you can use the Clipping Region.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-B</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>-drag a rectangular area.
The selected area will be “cut out” as the area of interest.
The rest of the 3D View gets hidden.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_brush_introduction_border-select.png" />
<span class="orange">The Clipping Region is used to select interesting parts for local painting.</span>

You make the entire mesh visible again by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-B</kbd> a second time.
All paint tools that use the view respect this clipping, including box select, and of course brush strokes.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Sculpt Mode is similar to Edit Mode in that it is used to alter the shape of a model,
but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow:
instead of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces),
an area of the model is altered using a brush.

In other words, instead of selecting a group of vertices,
Sculpt Mode manipulates geometry in the brush region of influence.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_sculpting_introduction_example.jpg" />
<span class="orange">Sculpting Mode Example.</span>
<h2>Sculpt Mode</h2>
Sculpt Mode is selected from the mode menu of the 3D View header.

Once Sculpt Mode is activated, the Toolbar of the 3D View will change to
Sculpt Mode specific panels. A red circle will appear and
follow the location of the cursor in the 3D View.
Note
To have a predictable brush behavior, apply the scale of your mesh.
<h2>The Brush</h2>

Sculpt Mode uses a similar brush to other the other <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/brush/introduction.html"><span class="blue">painting modes</span></a>,
but it is slightly more advanced. All the normal brush controls still apply,
and it functions exactly the same, however, the brush for sculpting is displayed in 3D.
This means that the brush will follow the contours of the mesh and the radius is displayed
by orienting the brush to match the meshes <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-normal"><span class="xref std std-term">normal</span></a>.
How closely the cursor follows the curvature of the mesh can be changed in

the <a href="tool_settings/brush_settings.html"><span class="blue">Brush Settings</span></a>.
The brush can also change depending on the currently active <a href="tools.html"><span class="blue">tool</span></a>
to better display how that tool works.

<dt>Draw Sharp</dt><dd>Similar to the Draw brush however, it deforms the mesh from the original coordinates
and uses the Sharper <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/brush/falloff.html"><span class="blue">Falloff</span></a>.
This is useful for creating cloth wrinkles, stylized hair or hard surface edges.</dd>

<dt>Smooth <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd></dt><dd>As the name suggests, eliminates irregularities in the area of the mesh within the brush's
influence by smoothing the positions of the vertices.</dd>
<dt>Flatten <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-T</kbd></dt><dd>The Flatten brush determines an “area plane”
located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area.
The vertices are then pulled towards this plane.

The inverse of the Flatten brush is the Contrast brush

<dt>Invert to Scrape</dt><dd>When enabled, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while sculpting

When disabled, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while sculpting,

will push vertices below the cursor downward.</dd></dd>
<dt>Scrape</dt><dd>The Scrape brush works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices above the plane downwards.
<dt>Invert to Fill</dt><dd>When enabled, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while sculpting
changes the brush behavior to be the same as the Fill brush.
When disabled, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while sculpting,
will push vertices above the cursor up away from the cursor.</dd></dd>

<dt>Multiplane Scrape</dt><dd>Scrapes the mesh with two angled planes at the same time, producing a sharp edge between them.
This is useful for creating edges when sculpting hard surface objects.
<dt>Plane Angle</dt><dd>The angle between the two planes of thush, pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> inverts the angle.</dd>
<dt>Dynamic Mode</dt><dd>When enabled, the base angle is sampled from the mesh surface.
The Plane Angle controls how much the angle will increase when applying pen pressure.
When pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>, it locks the plane angle to 0 degrees.</dd>

<dt>Show Cursor Preview</dt><dd>Displays a preview of the two scrape planes
and the angle they form instead of the cursor while performing the stroke.</dd></dd>
<dt>Pinch <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">P</kbd></dt><dd>Pulls vertices towards the center of the brush.
The inverse setting is Magnify, in which vertices are pushed away from the center of the brush.</dd>
<dt>Grab <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd></dt><dd>Used to drag a group of points around. Unlike the other brushes,
Grab does not modify different points as the brush is dragged across the model.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Adaptive Sculpting</span></h2>
In order for sculpting to give accurate and predictable results, Blender needs geometry to work with.

One way to accomplish this is starting off with a highly subdivided mesh.
The other way involves using either of two adaptive sculpting methods to add geometry dynamically.
<h2>Dynamic Topology</h2>
Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation
sculpting method that adds and removes details under the brush.
This works by first tessellating the mesh then applying the sculpting stroke on top of the tessellated mesh.

This makes it possible to sculpt complex shapes out of a simple mesh,
rather than just adding details onto a modeled base mesh.
See also
Dynamic Topology can be enabled in the <a href="tool_settings/dyntopo.html"><span class="blue">Dyntopo panel</span></a>.
<h2>Multiresolution Modifier</h2>
The Multiresolution Modifier can be used to dynamically subdivide the mesh.

The more subdivision the more computing will be needed. With the Blender stack
non-destructive data, multiresolution sculpting will help when you have a clean topology base mesh.
When sculpting with multiple resolutions you have the ability to sculpt in different levels of subdivision,
this mean you can sculpt some details in subdivision level 1 and add more details in
subdivision 2 and go back to subdivision 1 correct some mistakes. While this workflow is
often used, the Multiresolution Modifier has some limitations. You may end up with some mesh distortions.

As an advice, add as most details as possible before adding more subdivisions.
Clay brush works better with multiresolution sculpting to sculpt secondary forms.

While sculpting, areas might be hidden behind parts of the mesh or they might be too close to other parts.
To work through these, it is useful to isolate parts of a mesh to sculpt on.
This can be done by either completely hiding parts of the mesh
or by masking areas that can not be sculpted on.
<h2>Hide</h2>

Portions of the mesh can be hidden in Sculpt Mode to improve the viewport performance and
to access parts of the mesh that would otherwise be difficult to access,
because they are occluded by other parts.
The hidden faces cannot be sculpted on.
Hiding is shared between Edit Mode and Sculpt Mode
(i.e. hiding/unhiding in one mode affects the other mode too).

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
A UV texture is a picture (image, sequence or movie)
that is used to color the surface of a mesh.
The UV texture is mapped to the mesh through one or more UV maps.
There are three ways to establish the image used by the UV texture:
Paint a flat image in the Image Editor onto the currently selected UV texture,

using its UV map to transfer the colors to the faces of the mesh.
Paint the mesh in the 3D View, and let Blender use
the currently selected UV map to update the UV texture
(see <a href="index.html#painting-texture-index"><span class="std std-ref">Projection Painting</span></a>).
Use any image editing program to create an image. In the Image Editor,
select the UV texture and load the image. Blender will then use

that texture's UV map to transfer the colors to the faces of the mesh.
Blender features a built-in paint mode called Texture Paint which is designed
specifically to help you edit your UV textures and images quickly and
easily in either the Image Editor or the 3D Viewport.
Since a UV texture is just a special-purpose image,
you can also use any external paint program, like GIMP or Krita.

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_texture-paint_introduction_example.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_texture-paint_introduction_example.png" style="width: 430px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Texture painting in Blender.</span>
Since a mesh can have layers of UV textures, there may be many images that color the mesh.
However, each UV texture only has one image.
Texture Paint works in both a 3D View and the Image Editor.
In the 3D View in Texture Paint Mode, you paint directly on the mesh by

projecting onto the UVs.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Once you have unwrapped your model to a UV map, you can begin the texturing
process. You cannot paint on a mesh in Texture Paint Mode
without first unwrapping your mesh, and doing one of the following steps. Either:
See: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/editing/uv/applying_image.html"><span class="blue">Applying Image</span></a>.

After you have done one of these two things,
you can modify the image using the Texture Paint Mode:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_texture-paint_introduction_paint-mode.png" />
<span class="orange">Enabling paint mode.</span>
Activate the Texture Paint workspace. Here the 3D View has the Texture Paint
Mode enabled and the Image Editor is already switched to Paint mode.

In the 3D View, select Texture Paint Mode from the mode selector in the header,
and you can paint directly onto the mesh.
In the Image Editor, switch the mode to Paint (shown to the right).
Note
Square Power of Two
Texture Paint is very fast and responsive when working in the 3D View and

when your image is sized as a square where the side lengths are a power of
two, e.g. 256×256, 512×512, 1024×1024, etc.
Once you enable Texture Painting, your mouse becomes a brush.
To work with the UV layout (for example, to move coordinates) you must go back to “View” mode.
As soon as you enable Texture Painting or switch to Texture Paint Mode,
brush settings become available in the Toolbar.

In the Image Editor, you paint on a flat canvas that is wrapped around the mesh using UV coordinates.
Any changes made in the Image Editor show up immediately in the 3D View, and vice versa.
A full complement of brushes and colors can be selected from the Sidebar region in the Image Editor.
Brush changes made in either panel are immediately reflected in the other panel.
However, the modified texture will not be saved automatically;
you must explicitly do so by <span class="saddlebrown">Image Editor ‣ Image ‣ Save</span>.

<h3>Missing Data</h3>
When no UV layers or texture slots can be detected,
the system will display a warning and a few controls to add the relevant data in the Toolbar.
You will not be able to paint until all missing data have been added.
<dt>Add Simple UVs</dt><dd>The Add Simple UVs does a simple cube unwrap followed by a pack operation.
It's still recommended to make a custom unwrap.</dd>

<dt>Add Paint Slot</dt><dd>Add a material (if missing) and/or a texturot. (Todo 2.72)</dd>
<h2>Texture Preview</h2>
If your texture is already used to color, bump map, displace, alpha-transparent, etc.,
a surface of a model in your scene (in other technical words,
is mapped to some aspect of a texture via a texture channel using UV as a map input),
you can see the effects of your painting in the context of your scene as you paint.

To do this, set up side-by-side areas, one Area in 3D View set to Texture shading option,
and in the second Area the Image Editor loaded with your image.
Position the 3D View to show the object that is UV-mapped to the loaded image.
In the image to the right, the texture being painted is mapped to the “Normal” attribute,
and is called “bump mapping”, where the grayscale image is used to make the flat surface appear bumpy.
See Texture Mapping Output for more information on bump mapping.

<h2>Saving</h2>
If the header menu item Image has an asterisk next to it
means that the image has been changed, but not saved.
Use the <span class="saddlebrown">Image ‣ Save Image</span>
option to save your work with a different name or overwrite the original image.
Note

UV Textures
Since images used as UV textures are functionally different from other images,
you should keep them in a directory separate from other images.
The image format for saving is independent of the format for rendering.
The format for saving a UV image is selected in the header of the File Browser,
and defaults to <code><span class="sapphire">PNG</span></code> (<code><span class="sapphire">.png</span></code>).

If Packing is enabled in the File Browser's header, or if you manually <span class="saddlebrown">Image ‣ Pack Image</span>,
saving your images to a separate file is not necessary.
<h2>Using an External Image Editor</h2>
If you use an external program to edit your UV texture, you must:
Run that paint program (GIMP, Krita, etc.).
Load the image or create a new one.

Change the image.
And re-save it within that program.
Back in Blender, you reload the image in the Image Editor.
You want to use an external program if you have teams of people using different programs
that are developing the UV textures, or if you want to apply any special effects
that Texture Paint does not feature, or if you are much more familiar with

your favorite paint program.
<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<h3>UV Overlap</h3>
In general overlapping UVs are not supported (as with texture baking).
However, this is only a problem when a single brush stroke paints onto multiple faces
that share a texture.

<h3>Perspective View &amp; Faces Behind the View</h3>
When painting onto a face which is partially behind the view (in perspective mode),
the face cannot be painted on.
To avoid this, zoom out or use an orthographic viewport.
<h3>Perspective View &amp; Low Poly</h3>
When painting onto a face in perspective mode onto a low-poly object with

normals pointing away from the view, painting may fail; to workaround disable
the Normal option in the paint panel.
Typically this happens when painting onto the side of a cube
(see <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.blender.org/T34665">Bug report T34665</a>).

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Vertex Painting is a simple way of painting color onto an object, by directly
manipulating the color of vertices, rather than textures, and is fairly straightforward.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_vertex-paint_introduction_mode-menu.png" />
<span class="orange">Vertex Painting Mode.</span>
When a vertex is painted, the color of the vertex is modified according to

the settings of the brush. The color of all visible planes and edges attached to
the vertex are then modified with a gradient to the color of the other connected vertices.
Note that the color of occluded faces is not modified.
You can also the use <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/shader_nodes/input/attribute.html"><span class="blue">Attribute Node</span></a> to access
vertex color information in the material node tree.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>

Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated vertices
and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned vertex).
Weight Painting is a method to maintain large amounts of weight information
in a very intuitive way.
It is primarily used for rigging meshes, where the vertex groups are used to
define the relative bone influences on the mesh. But we use it also for

controlling particle emission, hair density, many modifiers, shape keys, etc.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_introduction_example.jpg" />
<span class="orange">Vertex group in Weight Paint Mode.</span>
You can enter Weight Paint Mode from the Mode selector <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Tab</kbd>.
The selected mesh object is displayed slightly shaded with a rainbow color spectrum.
The color visualizes the weights associated to each vertex in the active vertex group.

By default blue means unweighted and red means fully weighted.
You can assign weights to the vertices of the object by painting on it with weight brushes.
Starting to paint on a mesh automatically adds weights to the active vertex group
(a new vertex group is created if needed).
<h2>The Weighting Color Code</h2>
Weights are visualized by a gradient using a cold/hot color system,

such that areas of low value (with weights close to 0.0) are displayed as blue (cold)
and areas of high value (with weights close to 1.0) are displayed as red (hot).
And all in-between values are displayed as rainbow colors (blue, green, yellow, orange, red).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_introduction_color-code.png" />
<span class="orange">The color spectrum and their respective weights.</span>
In addition to the above described color code, Blender has a special visual notation

(as an option) for unreferenced vertices: They are displayed as black.
Thus you can see the referenced areas (displayed as cold/hot colors) and
the unreferenced areas (in black) at the same time.
This is most practicable when you look for weighting errors.
See <a href="tool_settings/options.html"><span class="blue">Options</span></a>.

You can customize the colors in the weight gradient by enabling

<h2><span class="greenbut">Using Vertex Groups</span></h2>
<h2>Vertex Groups for Bones</h2>
This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, vertices

around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to mimic the stretching
of the skin around the joint. Use a “light” weight (10 - 40%) paint on
the vertices around the joint so that they move a little when the bone rotates.
While there are ways to automatically assign weights to an armature
(see the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/armatures/skinning/index.html"><span class="blue">skinning section</span></a>),
you can do this manually. To do this from scratch, refer to the process below.

To modify automatically assigned weights, jump into the middle of the process where noted:
Create an armature.
Create a mesh that will be deformed when the armature's bone(s) move.
With the mesh selected, create an Armature modifier for your mesh
(located in the Properties editor, Modifiers tab).
Enter the name of the armature.

Pick up here for modifying automatically assigned weights.
Select the armature in 3D View, and bring the armature to Pose Mode
with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Tab</kbd>, or the 3D View header mode selector.
Select a desired bone in the armature.
Select your mesh with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> and change immediately to Weight Paint
Mode. The mesh will be colored according to the weight (degree)

that the selected bone movement affects the mesh. Initially, it will be all blue (no effect).
Weight paint to your heart's content. The mesh around the bone itself should
be red (generally) and fade out through the rainbow to blue for vertices
farther away from the bone.
When you select a bone of the armature (which remains in Pose Mode),
it will activate the corresponding vertex group and display related weights.

You can only select one bone at a time in this mode (so <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> clicking does not work).
Tip
If the mesh skins the bones, you will not be able to see the bones because
the mesh is painted. If so, turn on X-Ray view
(<span class="saddlebrown">Properties Editor ‣ Armature tab</span>).
If you paint on the mesh, a vertex group is created for the bone.

If you paint on vertices outside the group, the painted vertices are
automatically added to the vertex group.
If you have a symmetrical mesh and a symmetrical armature you can use the option X Mirror.
Then the mirrored groups with the mirrored weights are automatically created.
Tip
Selecting Deform Groups

When you are doing weight painting for deform bones (with an armature),
you can select a deform group by selecting the corresponding bone.
However, this vertex group selection mode is disabled when Selection Masking is active!
<h2>Vertex Groups for Particles</h2>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_usage_particles.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_usage_particles.png" style="width: 320px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Weight painted particle emission.</span>

In example faces or vertices with zero weight generate no particles.
A weight of 0.1 will result in 10% of the amounts of particles.
This option “conserves” the total indicated number of particles, adjusting the distributions
so that the proper weights are achieved while using the actual number of particles called for.
Use this to make portions of your mesh hairier than others by weight painting a vertex group,
and then calling out the name of the vertex group

<span class="orange">Weight Paint Tools.</span>
Blender provides a set of helper tools for Weight Painting.
The Subset Option

Some of the tools also provide a Subset filter to restrict their functionality to only specific vertex groups
(in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel, displayed after the tool is called)
with following options:
Active Group
Selected Pose Bones
Deform Pose Bones

All Groups
All tools also work with Vertex Selection Masking and Face Selection Masking.
In these modes the tools operate only on selected vertices or faces.
<h2>Assign from Bone Envelopes</h2>
Apply the envelope weight of the selected bone(s) to the selected vertex group.
<h2>Assign Automatic from Bone</h2>

Apply from the selected bone(s) to the vertex group the same “auto-weighting” methods
as available in the Parent armature menu.
<h2>Normalize All</h2>
For each vertex, this tool makes sure that the sum of the weights across
all vertex groups is equal to 1. This tool normalizes all of the vertex groups,
except for locked groups, which keep their weight values untouched.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_normalize.png" />
<span class="orange">Normalize All options.</span>
<dt>Lock Active</dt><dd>Keep the values of the active group while norzing all the others.</dd>
<h2>Normalize</h2>
This tool only works on the active vertex group. All vertices keep their relative weights,
but the entire set of weights is scaled up such that the highest weight value is 1.0.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_normalize-example.png" />
<span class="orange">Normalize example.</span>
<h2>Mirror</h2>
The Mirror Vertex Group tool mirrors the weights from one side of a perfectly symmetrical mesh
to the opposite side. Only mirroring along local X axis is supported.
Those vertices that have no corresponding vertex on the other side will not be affected.

But note, the weights are not transferred to the corresponding opposite bone weight group.

<span class="orange">Mirror options.</span>
<dt>Mirror Weights</dt><dd>With this option checked, every selected vertex receives

the weight information of its symmetrical counterpart.
If both vertices are selected, it will be a weight information exchange;
if only one is selected, information from the unselected will overwrite the selected one.
Information on weight is passed for the active group only,
unless All Groups is checked, in which case it is passed for all groups.</dd>
<dt>Flip Group Names</dt><dd>Works with selected vertices that belong to vertex groups with “symmetrical names”

(with components like “L”, “R”, “right”, “left”).
All selected vertices that belong to the active group, or to the symmetrical of the active group,
will have their assignation to that group replaced by an assignation to the symmetrical one;
however, its weight will be preserved.
If All Groups is checked, all assignations to these kind of groups
will be replaced by the symmetrical counterpart, also keeping the old weights.</dd>

<dt>All Groups</dt><dd>Operate on all vertex groups, instead of the ac one.</dd>
<dt>Topology Mirror</dt><dd>Mirror for meshes which are not 100% symmetric (approximate mirror).
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.html#modeling-meshes-editing-topology-mirror"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> for more information.</dd>
Tip
Mirror to Opposite Bone
If you want to create a mirrored weight group for the opposite bone

(of a symmetric character), then you can do this:
Delete the target vertex group (where the mirrored weights will be placed).
Create a copy of the source bone vertex group
(the group containing the weights which you want to copy).
Rename the new vertex group to the name of the target vertex group
(the group you deleted above).

Select the target vertex group and call the Mirror tool
(use only the Mirror weights option and optionally Topology Mirror if your mesh is not symmetric).
<h2>Invert</h2>
Replaces each Weight of the selected weight group by × -1.0 weight.
Examples:
Original 1.0 converts to 0.0

Original 0.5 remains 0.5
Original 0.0 converts to 1.0

<dt>Remove Weights</dt><dd>Remove vertices from the vertex group if  are 0.0 after inverting.</dd>
Note

<h2>Clean</h2>
Removes weights below a given threshold.
This tool is useful for clearing your weight groups of very low (or zero) weights.
In the example shown, a cutoff value of 0.2 is used (see operator options below)
so all blue parts are cleaned out.
Note, the images use the Show Zero weights Active option

so that unreferenced Weights are shown in Black.

<dt>Keep Single</dt><dd>Ensure that the Clean tool will not create completely unreferenced vertices
(vertices which are not assigned to any vertex group), so each vertex will

<h2>Quantize</h2>
This operator uses a process known as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization">Quantization</a>
which takes the input weights and clamps each weight to a number of steps between (0 - 1),
so there is no longer a smooth gradient between values.

<h2>Levels</h2>
Adds an offset and a scale to all weights of the selected weight groups.
with this tool you can raise or lower the overall “heat” of the weight group.
Note

No weight will ever be set to values above 1.0 or below 0.0 regardless of the settings.

<dt>Offset</dt><dd>A value from the range (-1.0 - 1.0) to be adde all weights in the vertex group.</dd>
<dt>Gain</dt><dd>All weights in the Subset are multiplied with the ga</dd>
Note
Whichever Gain and Offset you choose,
in all cases the final value of each weight will be clamped to the range

(0.0 - 1.0). So you will never get negative weights or overheated areas
(weight &gt; 1.0) with this tool.
<h2>Smooth</h2>
Tip
The Smooth tool only works when “Vertex selection masking for painting” is enabled.
Otherwise the tool button is grayed out.

Blends the weights of selected vertices with adjacent unselected vertices.
This tool only works in vertex select mode.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth-example-1.png" />
To understand what the tool really does, let us take a look at a simple example.
The selected vertex is connected to four adjacent vertices
(marked with a gray circle in the image). All adjacent vertices are unselected.

Now the tool calculates the average weight of all connected and unselected vertices.
In the example this is:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 4 = 0.25\)</span>
This value is multiplied by the factor given in the Operator options (see below).
If the factor is 0.0 then actually nothing happens at all and the vertex just keeps its value.
If the factor is 1.0 then the calculated average weight is taken (0.25 here).

Dragging the factor from 0 to 1 gradually changes from the old value to the calculated average.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth-example-2.png" />
Now let us see what happens when we select all
but one of the neighbors of the selected vertex as well.
Again all connected and unselected vertices are marked with a gray circle.
When we call the Smooth tool now and set the Factor to 1.0,

then we see different results for each of the selected vertices:
The top-most and bottom-most selected vertices:
are surrounded by three unselected vertices, with an average weight of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.333\)</span>
So their color has changed to light green.
The middle vertex:
is connected to one unselected vertex with <code><span class="sapphire">weight</span> <span class="sapphire">=</span> <span class="sapphire">1</span></code>.

So the average weight is 1.0 in this case, thus the selected vertex color has changed to red.
The right vertex:
is surrounded by three unselected vertices with average weight = <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((0 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.0\)</span>
So the average weight is 0, thus the selected vertex color has not changed at all
(it was already blue before Smooth was applied).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth-example-3.png" />

Finally let us look at a practical example.
The middle edge loop has been selected
and it will be used for blending the left side to the right side of the area.
All selected vertices have two unselected adjacent vertices.
The average weight of the unselected vertices is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1 + 0) / 2 = 0.5\)</span>
Thus when the Factor is set to 1.0 then the edge loop turns to

green and finally does blend the cold side (right) to the hot side (left).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth.png" />
<span class="orange">Smooth options.</span>
<dt>Factor</dt><dd>The effective amount of blending.
When Factor is set to 0.0 then the <a href="#smooth">Smooth</a> tool does not do anything.
For Factor &gt; 0 the weights of the affected vertices gradually shift from their original value

towards the average weight of all connected and unselected vertices (see examples above).</dd>

<dt>Only Selected</dt><dd>Smoothing will only smooth with selected vers.</dd>

<dt>Only Deselected</dt><dd>Smoothing will only smooth with dected vertices.</dd></dd>
<h2>Transfer Weights</h2>
Copy weights from other objects to the vertex groups of the active object.
By default this tool copies only the active (selected) vertex group of the source object
to the active vertex group of target object or creates a new one if the group does not exist.
However, you can change the tool's behavior in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel.

For example, to transfer all existing vertex groups from the source objects to the target,
change the Source Layers Selection option to By Name.
Note
This tool uses the generic “data transfer”, but transfers from all selected objects to active one.
Please refer to
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/editing/data_transfer.html"><span class="blue">Data Transfer</span></a> docs for options details and explanations.

<h3>Prepare the Copy</h3>
You first select all source objects, and finally the target object
(the target object must be the active object).
It is important that the source objects and the target object are at the same location.
If they are placed side-by-side, then the weight transfer will not work. (See the Vertex Mapping option.)
You can place the objects on different layers,

but you have to ensure that all objects are visible when you call the tool.
Now ensure that the target object is in Weight Paint Mode.
Open the Toolbar and call the Transfer Weights tool in the Weight Tools panel.
<h3>Adjust Last Operation Panel Confusion</h3>
You may notice that the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel stays available
after the weight transfer is done. The panel only disappears

when you call another Operator that has its own <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel.
This can lead to confusion when you use Transfer weights repeatedly after you changed your vertex groups.
If you then use the still-visible <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel,
then Blender will reset your work to its state right before you initially called the Transfer Weights tool.
So when you want to call the Transfer Weights tool again after you made some changes to your
vertex groups, then always use the Transfer Weights button,

even if the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html#ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation"><span class="std std-ref">Adjust Last Operation</span></a> panel is still available.
Unless you really want to reset your changes to the initial call of the tool.
<h2>Limit Total</h2>
Reduce the number of weight groups per vertex to the specified Limit.
The tool removes lowest weights first until the limit is reached.
Hint

The tool can only work reasonably when more than one weight group is selected.
<dt>Subset</dt><dd>Restrict the tool to a subset.
See above <a href="#sculpt-paint-weight-paint-editing-subset"><span class="std std-ref">The Subset Option</span></a> for how subsets are defined.</dd>
<dt>Limit</dt><dd>Maximum number of weights allowed on each vertex.</dd>
<h2>Fix Deforms</h2>
The Fix deforms tool is used to modify an object's nonzero weights so its deformed

vertices are at a new defined distance. This is helpful to fix deformations
because when complex models are deformed to their extreme poses,
they are often visibly bumpy, jagged, or otherwise incorrectly deformed.
Using this tool, you can smooth over the deformation.
To use the tool, select the vertices that you would like to move,
either in Edit Mode or by using the vertex selection/mask.

The operator can now be used and altered with these options:
<dt>Distance</dt><dd>The distance to move to.</dd>
<dt>Strength</dt><dd>The distance moved can be changed by this factor.</dd>
<dt>Accuracy</dt><dd>Changes the amount weights are altered weach iteration: lower values are slower.</dd>
Note
Note that if it does not change, then there are no nonzero bone weights

that are changed to make it closer to the intended distance.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Grease Pencil is a particular type of Blender object that allow you to draw in the 3D space.
Can be use to make traditional 2D animation, cut-out animation, motion graphics or
use it as storyboard tool among other things.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_introduction_example.png" />

<span class="orange">An example of a Grease Pencil object in the 3D environment.</span>
The object act as a container of strokes that you can create using drawing tools
in <a href="modes/draw/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Draw Mode</span></a>.
More detailed editing of the strokes is done
in <a href="modes/edit/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Edit Mode</span></a>, and
<a href="modes/sculpting/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Sculpt Mode</span></a>.

Tip
To obtain best results with Grease Pencil is highly recommended to
use a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/getting_started/configuration/hardware.html#hardware-tablet"><span class="std std-ref">Graphics Tablet</span></a>.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Structure</span></h2>
Grease Pencil object has three main basic components: points, edit lines and strokes.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_structure_example.png" />

<span class="orange">Example of Grease Pencil structure.</span>
<h2>Points</h2>
The main element used in editing Grease Pencil objects are points.
Points represent a single point in 3D space.
Each point stores all the properties that define the final appearance of the strokes
as its location, thickness, alpha, weight and UV rotation for textures.

<h2>Edit Lines</h2>
Points are always connected by a straight line,
which you see when you are editing in Edit Mode or when you look at a stroke in wireframe view.
They are invisible on the rendered image and are used to construct the final stroke.
<h2>Strokes</h2>
The stroke is the rendered image of the points and edit lines,

using a particular <a href="materials/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Grease Pencil material</span></a>.
(Grease Pencil materials are linked at stroke level.)

It creates a 2D monkey head. The Monkey's name is “Suzanne” and is Blender's mascot.
2D Suzanne is very useful as a standard test.
Note
Materials and 2D Layers
Adding Stroke or Monkey primitives also adds a set of preset materials and 2D layers
to help start drawing with the new object.

Hint
When all points of a stroke are selected, nothing will happen
(as for Less, all linked points are always selected, and of course, More cannot add any).
Conversely, the same goes when no points are selected.
<h2></h2><span 
id="bpy-types-greasepencil-use-multiedit"></span><h2>Multiframe</h2>

Multiframe allows you to edit, sculpt or weight painting on several frames at the same time.
Extremely useful to avoid making a repetitive task one frame at a time when animating.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_multiframe_panel.png" />
<span class="orange">Multiframe panel.</span>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Select the desired keyframes to edit or sculpt at the same time.

Activate the Multiframe tool in the 3D View's header with the toggle button (fade lines icon).
Once activated you can:
Select the points in all the selected keyframes and make your editions.
Start sculpting. The sculpt brushes will affects all the strokes in the selected keyframes.
Start weight painting. The weight paint brush will affect all the strokes in the selected keyframes.
<dt>Use Falloff</dt><dd>When enabled, the effects on the strokes start to falloff from the current frame

<h2>2D Layers</h2>
Strokes can be grouped in 2D layers, a special Grease Pencil layers
that help to organize the drawing order and visibility of the strokes.

See <a href="layers.html"><span class="blue">2D Layers</span></a> for more information.
<h2>Onion Skinning</h2>
Onion skinning is used in animation to see several frames at once and make decisions or
edits based on how the previous/next frames are drawn.
See <a href="onion_skinning.html"><span class="blue">Onion Skinning</span></a> for more information.
<h2>Vertex Groups</h2>

Vertex groups can be used to assign a group or weighted group to some operator.
An object can have several weight groups and can be assigned in
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modes/weight_paint/index.html"><span class="blue">Weight Paint Mode</span></a>.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/properties/vertex_groups/index.html"><span class="blue">Vertex Groups</span></a> for more information.
<h2>Strokes</h2>

<span class="orange">Grease Pencil Layers panel.</span>
<h2>Layers List</h2>
Grease Pencil objects each have a list of 2D layers for grouping and arranging strokes

in a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/list_presets.html#ui-list-view"><span class="std std-ref">List view</span></a>. Any stroke can only belong to a single 2D layer.
There is always only one active layer in the list (the selected one).
When you draw, the new strokes are added to the active layer.
By default the view order of the layers in the viewport is top to bottom.
Every layer correspond to a channel in the Dope Sheet editor (in Grease Pencil mode).
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/dope_sheet/grease_pencil.html"><span class="blue">Dope Sheet</span></a> for more information.

Layers can also be used together with Modifiers to only affects part of your drawing.
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modifiers/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Modifiers</span></a> for more information.
Tip
Sometimes the layers that your are not working on could be a distraction,
you can activate Fade Layers in overlays to control the opacity of the non active layers.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/controls/overlays.html"><span class="blue">Overlays</span></a> for more information.

Next to the layer name there are four icons buttons that control common properties of the layer:
<dt>Mask (mask icon)</dt><dd>When the mask is enabled, all the layers below the current one function as a single mask.
This mask hide any pixel in the current layer outside the mask created by the underlying layers.

Grease Pencil has their own set of Modifiers.
Modifiers are automatic operations that affect an object in a non-destructive way.
With modifiers, you can perform many effects automatically that would otherwise be
too tedious to do manually and without affecting the base geometry of your object.
They work by changing how an object is displayed and rendered, but not the geometry which you can edit directly.

You can add several modifiers to a single object forming the modifier stack
and Apply a modifier if you wish to make its changes permanent.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_modifiers_introduction_menu.png" />
<span class="orange">Grease Pencil Modifiers menu.</span>
There are three types of modifiers for Grease Pencil:
<dt>Generate</dt><dd>The Generate group of modifiers includes constructive tools that either change

the general appearance of or automatically add new geometry to an object.</dd>
<dt>Deform</dt><dd>The Deform group of modifiers only cha the shape of an object without adding new geometry,</dd>
<dt>Color</dt><dd>The Color group of modifiers change thject color output.</dd>

Each modifier's interface shares the same basic components like modifiers for meshes.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/modifiers/introduction.html#bpy-types-modifier-show"><span class="std std-ref">Modifiers Interface</span></a> for more information.
Note
Grease Pencil strokes, unlike meshes, still can not be edited directly in the place.
<h3>Influence Filters</h3>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Visual Effects</span></dd>

Grease Pencil has a special set of viewport real-time visual effects that can be apply to the object.
These effects treat the object as if it was just an image, for that reason they
have effect on the whole object and cannot limit their influence
on certain parts like layers, materials or vertex group as with modifiers.
Also unlike modifiers, they can not be applied to the object.
Their main purpose is to have a quick way to visualize certain effects on your drawings

like blurring, pixelation, wave distortion, among others.
The effects are extremely dependent on the zoom and orientation of the viewport or camera.
So keep in mind that they may vary with viewport or camera changes.
Note
Visual Effects are mainly for quick viewport visualization and are not so reliable for final production renders.
If you want more precision with effects it is recommended to

use the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Compositor</span></a>.

The visual effects panels and interface are similar to modifiers.
Each effect shares the same basic interface components similar to modifiers for meshes.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Materials control the appearance of the Grease Pencil object.
They define the color and texture of the strokes and filled areas.
There is always only one active material in the list (the selected one).
When you draw, the new strokes use the active material.

The material always remains linked to the strokes, this means that any change in a material will change
the look of already drawn strokes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_materials_introduction_sample.png" />
<span class="orange">Same stroke linked to different materials.</span>
<h2>Setting up Materials</h2>
Grease Pencil materials can be created in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/properties_editor.html"><span class="blue">Material properties</span></a>

as any other materials in Blender.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/materials/assignment.html"><span class="blue">Material assignment</span></a> for more information.
The 3D Viewport can be set to Material Preview or Rendered shading,
to interactively preview how the material looks in the scene.
Grease Pencil materials are data-blocks that can be <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/materials/assignment.html"><span class="blue">assigned</span></a>
to one or more objects, and different materials can be assigned to different strokes.

In Grease Pencil the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modes/draw/tool_settings/index.html"><span class="blue">brush</span></a>
settings together with the material used will define the look and feel of the final strokes.
Materials slots in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/list_presets.html#ui-list-view"><span class="std std-ref">List view</span></a> also have some extra controls
that help to work with materials while drawing or editing lines.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Grease Pencil Shader</span></h2>
Grease Pencil materials use a special <a href="grease_pencil_shader.html"><span class="blue">shader</span></a>
that define the appearance of the surface of the stroke and fill.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_materials_grease-pencil-shader_panel.png" />
<span class="orange">Shader panel with only Stroke component activated.</span>

The Grease Pencil shader create a material that can work
with strokes and/or filled areas of a Grease Pencil object.
Stroke and fill components has it own section panel and
they can be enabled with a checkbox on the panel header.
Stroke only has effect on the lines and Fill only on the areas
determined by closed lines (by connecting the lines start and end points).

Note
The shader is not yet a BSDF capable shader to interact with Blender lights
and can only be setting up on the Material Properties panel (it is not a shader node).

<h2>Animating with Grease Pencil</h2>

The main goal of Grease Pencil is to offer a 2D animation tools full immersed in a 3D environment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_animation_introduction_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Sample animation showing Grease Pencil object keyframes in the Dope Sheet with onion skinning enabled.</span>
In Blender, Grease Pencil objects can be animated in many ways:
<dt>Moving as a whole object</dt><dd>Changing their position, orientn or size in time;</dd>
<dt>Drawing frame by frame</dt><dd>Drawing one frame at a time (traonal animation).</dd>

<dt>Deforming them</dt><dd>Animating their points;</dd>
<dt>Inherited animation</dt><dd>Causing the object to move based on the movement of another object
(e.g. its parent, hook, armature, etc.). Useful for cut-out animation for example.</dd>
For a complete overview of animation in Blender please refer to
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/index.html"><span class="blue">Animation &amp; Rigging</span></a> chapter.
<h2>2D Traditional Animation</h2>

<h3>Keyframes</h3>
Traditional animation in Grease Pencil is achieved with the use of
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/keyframes/introduction.html"><span class="blue">keyframes</span></a>
that hold the strokes information at a particular frame.
Every time you create a stroke in Grease Pencil object Draw Mode
a new keyframe is added at the current frame on the active channel.

Note
The channels in the Dope Sheet correspond to the active 2D layer of the Grease Pencil object.
Grease Pencil has its own mode in the Dope Sheet to works with keyframes.
See Grease Pencil mode in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/dope_sheet/grease_pencil.html"><span class="blue">Dope Sheet</span></a>
section for more information.
There are also several tools on the Stroke menu to work with keyframes and strokes.

See <a href="tools.html"><span class="blue">Animation tools</span></a> for more information.
<h3>Onion Skinning</h3>
One key element in traditional animation is the use of onion skinning.
Grease Pencil offer a lot of flexibility and options for this tool.
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/properties/onion_skinning.html"><span class="blue">Onion Skinning</span></a> for more information.
<h2>Animation Options</h2>

In Draw Mode there are two option related to the animation workflow that you can use.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_animation_introduction_drawing-options.png" />
<span class="orange">General drawing/animation options.</span>
<dt>Add Weight Data</dt><dd>When enabled, new strokes weight data is added according to the current vertex group and weights.
If there is no vertex group selected, no weight data is added.
This is useful for example in cut-out animation for adding new drawing

on the same vertex group without the need to creating it afterwards.
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modes/weight_paint/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Weight Paint Mode</span></a> for more information.</dd>
<dt>Additive Drawing</dt><dd>When creating new frames, the strokes  the previous/active frame are include as a basis for the new one.</dd>
In Edit Mode there are two option related to the animation workflow that you can use.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/grease-pencil_animation_introduction_edit-options.png" />
<span class="orange">Multiframe edition.</span>

<dt>Multiframe</dt><dd>Sometimes you may need to modify several frames at the same time with edit tools,
for example to repositioning drawings in an animation.
You can activate multiframe edition with the Multiframe button next to the modes selector (faded lines icon).
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/multiframe.html"><span class="blue">Multiframe</span></a> for more information.</dd>
<dt>Interpolate</dt><dd>When you are animating simple shapes with strokes that have the same amount of points,
you can use the Interpolate tool to automatically add new breakdown keyframes.

See <a href="interpolation.html"><span class="blue">Interpolation</span></a> for more information.</dd>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Traditional Animation</h3>
This example shows you how to animate a bouncing ball
with a traditional 2D animation technique and Grease Pencil.
First, go to menu <span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ New ‣ 2D Animation</span> to start with a new 2D animation template.

The template is ready to quick start your animation with a Grease Pencil object already created,
onion skinning activated and in camera view.
Set the range of the animation in the Timeline from 1 to 24.
In the 3D View draw a ball on the upper left corner with the Draw Tool (extreme).
Move to frame 12 and draw a squashed ball in the bottom center (breakdown).
Move to frame 24 and draw a ball in the top right corner of the 3D View (extreme).

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Draw Mode is the mode in Grease Pencil that allows you to draw in the 3D View.
This mode is actually the only one in which new strokes can be created.
Already made strokes can not be selected in Draw Mode, for editing strokes you must use
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/edit/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Edit Mode</span></a> or
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/sculpting/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Sculpt Mode</span></a>.

<h2>Draw Mode</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../_images/grease-pencil_modes_draw_introduction_mode-selector.png" />
<span class="orange">3D View Mode selector: Draw Mode.</span>
Draw Mode is selected with the Mode menu in the 3D Viewport header.
Once Draw Mode is activated, the Toolbar of the 3D Viewport will change to Draw Mode specific panels.
Also a circle with the same color as the active material will appear and

follow the location of the cursor in the 3D View.
To create new strokes you have to select one of the drawing tools in the Toolbar.
The most common one is the <a href="tools.html"><span class="blue">Draw tool</span></a>
for free-hand drawings but there are many other tools for drawing, filling areas and erasing strokes.
There are also some tools to create primitives shapes like lines, arcs, curves, boxes and circles.
See <a href="tools.html"><span class="blue">Toolbar</span></a> for more details.

<h2>Strokes Location and Orientation Controls</h2>
Drawing in a 3D space is not the same as drawing on a flat canvas.
When drawing with Grease Pencil you have to define
the location and orientation of the new strokes in the 3D space.

<span class="orange">3D View header Controls for strokes.</span>

<h3>Stroke Placement</h3>
The Stroke Placement selector defines the new strokes location in 3D space.
See <a href="stroke_placement.html"><span class="blue">Stroke Placement</span></a> for more information.
<h3>Drawing Planes</h3>
The Drawing Planes selector defines the plane (orientation) to which the new strokes will be restricted.
See <a href="drawing_planes.html"><span class="blue">Drawing Planes</span></a> for more information.

<h3>Guides</h3>
Different Guides types can be activated to assist you when drawing new strokes.
See <a href="guides.html"><span class="blue">Guides</span></a> for more information.

<dt>Draw on Back</dt><dd>When enabled, new strokes are drawn below of all strokes in the layer.
For example when you want to paint with a fill material below line strokes on a character and
they are on the same layer.</dd>
<dt>Add Weight Data</dt><dd>When enabled, weight data is added to new strokes according to the current vertex group and weight.
If there is no vertex group selected, no weight data is added.
Useful for example in cut-out animation for adding new drawing

on the same vertex group without the need to creating it afterwards.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>

Sculpt Mode is similar to Edit Mode in that it is used to alter the shape of a drawing,
but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow:
Instead of dealing with individual elements (points and edit lines),
an area of the model is altered using a brush.
In other words, instead of selecting a group of points,
Sculpt Mode manipulates the drawing in the brush region of influence.

<h2>Sculpt Mode</h2>

Sculpt Mode is selected from the Mode menu in the 3D View header.
Once Sculpt Mode is activated, the Toolbar of the 3D View will change to
Sculpt Mode specific panels.

A red circle will appear and follow the location of the cursor in the 3D View.

<dt>Selection Mask</dt><dd>Sculpt Mode in Grease Pencil allows you to select points or strokes to restrict the effect
of the sculpting tools to only a certain areas of your drawing.

You can use the selection tools in the Toolbar for a quick selections.
You can restrict sculpting only on the selected points or strokes with the Selection mode buttons.</dd>
<dt>Multiframe</dt><dd>Sometimes you may need to modify several frames at the same time with the sculpting tools.
You can activate multiframe edition with the Multiframe button next to the modes selector (faded lines icon).

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Assigning weight to the points is primarily used for rigging strokes in cut-out animation,
where the vertex groups are used to define the relative bone influences on the strokes.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../sculpt_paint/weight_paint/usage.html"><span class="blue">Using Vertex Group</span></a> for more information.
Note
A vertex in Grease Pencil is called point.

Weight Painting is a method to maintain large amounts of weight information in a very intuitive way.
The selected Grease Pencil object is displayed slightly shaded with a rainbow color spectrum.
The color visualizes the weights associated to each point in the active vertex group.
By default blue means unweighted and red means fully weighted.
You assign weights to the points of the object by painting on it with weight brushes.
Starting to paint on a strokes automatically adds weights to the active vertex group

(a new vertex group is created if needed).

<h2>Animation</h2>
Animation is making an object move or change shape over time.

Objects can be animated in many ways:
<dt>Moving as a whole object</dt><dd>Changing their position, orientn or size in time;</dd>
<dt>Deforming them</dt><dd>Animating their vertices or control points;</dd>
<dt>Inherited animation</dt><dd>Causing the object to move base the movement of another object (e.g. its parent, hook, armature, etc.).</dd>
In this chapter, we will cover the first two,
but the basics given here are actually vital for understanding the following chapters as well.

Animation is typically achieved with the use of <a href="keyframes/introduction.html"><span class="blue">keyframes</span></a>.

<h2>Rigging</h2>
Rigging is a general term used for adding controls to objects,
typically for the purpose of animation.
Rigging often involves using one or more of the following features:
<dt><a href="armatures/index.html#armatures-index"><span class="std std-ref">Armatures</span></a></dt><dd>This allows meshects to have flexible joints and is often used for skeletal animation.</dd>

<dt><a href="constraints/index.html#constraints-index"><span class="std std-ref">Constraints</span></a></dt><dd>To control the kinds of motions that make sense and add functlity to the rig.</dd>
<dt><a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/modifiers/index.html#modifiers-index"><span class="std std-ref">Object Modifiers</span></a></dt><dd>Mesh deformation can be quite ived, there are multiple modifiers that help control this.</dd>
<dt><a href="shape_keys/index.html#animation-shape-keys-index"><span class="std std-ref">Shape Keys</span></a></dt><dd>To support different target shapes (such acial expressions) to be controlled.</dd>
<dt><a href="drivers/index.html#animation-drivers-index"><span class="std std-ref">Drivers</span></a></dt><dd>So your rig can control many different values at once,
as well as making some properties automatically update based on changes elsewhere.</dd>
Rigging can be as advanced as your project requires,

rigs are effectively defining own user interface for the animator to use,
without having to be concerned the underlying mechanisms.
<h3>Examples</h3>
An armature is often used with a modifier to deform a mesh for character animation.
A camera rig can be used instead of animating the camera object directly to simulate real-world camera rigs
(with a boom arm, mounted on a rotating pedestal for example, effects such as camera jitter can be added too).

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
A Keyframe is simply a marker of time which stores the value of a property.
For example, a Keyframe might define that the horizontal position of a cube is at 3 m on frame 1.

The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, meaning, for example,
that the user could then add another key on frame 10, specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20 m,
and Blender will automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the frames between frame 1 and 10
depending on the chosen interpolation method (e.g. Linear, Bézier, Quadratic, etc.).
An overview of existing keyframes can be seen via the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/dope_sheet/index.html"><span class="blue">Dope Sheet</span></a> editor.
<h2>Visualization</h2>

There are some important visualization features in the 3D Views that can help animation.
When the current frame is a keyframe for the current active object, the name of this object
(shown in the upper left corner of the 3D Views) turns yellow.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_keyframes_introduction_visualization.png" />
<span class="orange">Top: Current frame is a keyframe for Cube. Bottom: Current frame isn't a keyframe.</span>
<h2>Interpolation</h2>

Keyframe interpolation is represented and controlled by
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html"><span class="blue">animation curves</span></a>,
also known as <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-f-curve"><span class="xref std std-term">F-Curves</span></a>. These curves can be viewed and modified
via the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/index.html"><span class="blue">Graph Editor</span></a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_keyframes_introduction_curves.png" />
<span class="orange">Constant, Linear, Quadratic and Bézier interpolation, with Linear extrapolation.</span>

The X axis of the curve corresponds to time, while Y represents the value of the property.
Keyframes themselves define points of the curve, while interpolation is controlled by additional parameters.
The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html#editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation"><span class="std std-ref">Interpolation Mode</span></a> is the main setting
that specifies for each keyframe how the curve is interpolated from that key to
the next one. There are a number of modes with fixed shapes,
e.g. Constant, Linear, Quadratic etc, and a free form Bézier mode.

<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html#editors-graph-fcurves-settings-extrapolation"><span class="std std-ref">Extrapolation</span></a> specifies how
the curve extends before the first, and after the last keyframe.
The main available choices are Constant and Linear;
it is also possible to configure the curve to loop.
Bézier interpolation is controlled by handles, which have
a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html#editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles"><span class="std std-ref">handle type</span></a> and position.

The position of Free and Aligned handles must be set manually from the Graph editor,
while Vector, Automatic and Auto Clamped handles are computed automatically from
keyframe values.
Interpolation, Extrapolation and Handle Type can also be changed from
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/dope_sheet/index.html"><span class="blue">Dope Sheet</span></a> editor.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_properties_auto-smoothing.png" />

<span class="orange">Handle smoothing modes. Yellow: None, Cyan: Continuous Acceleration.</span>
The method how the three automatic handle types are computed is controlled by
the per-curve <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/properties.html#graph-editor-auto-handle-smoothing"><span class="std std-ref">Auto Handle Smoothing</span></a> setting.
The None mode resembles how most other software works and only considers the values
of the immediately adjacent keys. The Continuous Acceleration mode considers the shape
of the whole curve, which produces smoother results out of the box, but means that changes

in one key affect interpolation over a larger section of the curve; it also tends to
overshoot more with Automatic handles.
<h2>Keyframe Types</h2>
For visually distinguishing regular keyframes from different animation events or
states (extremes, breakdowns, or other in-betweens)
there is the possibility of applying different colors on them for visualization.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_keyframes_introduction_types.png" />
<span class="orange">Left: not selected; Right: selected.</span>
<dt>Keyframe (white / yellow diamond)</dt><dd>Normal keyframe.</dd>
<dt>Breakdown (small cyan diamond)</dt><dd>Breakdown state.  for transitions between key poses.</dd>
<dt>Moving Hold (dark gray / orange diamond)</dt><dd>A keyframe that adds a small amount of motion around a holding pose.
In the Dope Sheet it will also display a bar between them.</dd>

<dt>Extreme (big pink diamond)</dt><dd>An ‘extreme' state, or sother purpose as needed.</dd>
<dt>Jitter (tiny green diamond)</dt><dd>A filler or baked keyframe foying on ones, or some other purpose as needed.</dd>
<h2>Handles &amp; Interpolation Mode Display</h2>
Dope Sheet can display the Bézier handle type associated with the keyframe,
and mark segments with non-Bézier interpolation.
This facilitates basic editing of interpolation without the use of the Graph Editor.

The icon shape represents the type of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html#editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles"><span class="std std-ref">Bézier Handles</span></a>
belonging to the keyframe.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_keyframes_introduction_interpolation.png" />
<span class="orange">From top: summary, Bézier, linear.</span>

</table>
If the handles of a keyframe have different types,
or in case of summary rows representing multiple curves,
out of the available choices the icon that is furthest down the list is used.
This means that if a grouped row uses a circle icon,
it is guaranteed that none of the grouped channels have a non-auto key.

Horizontal green lines mark the use of
non-Bézier <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html#editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation"><span class="std std-ref">Interpolation</span></a>.
The line is dimmed in summary rows if not all grouped channels have the same interpolation.
Display of this information can be disabled via the Show Handles and Interpolation
option of the Dope Sheet's <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/dope_sheet/introduction.html#dope-sheet-view-menu"><span class="std std-ref">View Menu</span></a>.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Keyframe Animation</h3>
This example shows you how to animate a cube's location, rotation, and scale.
First, in the Timeline, or other animation editors, set the frame to 1.
With the Cube selected in Object Mode, press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">I</kbd> in the 3D View.
From the Insert Keyframe Menu select LocRotScale.
This will record the location, rotation, and scale, for the Cube on frame 1.

Set the frame to 100.
Use Move <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd>, Rotate <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">R</kbd>, Scale <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd>, to transform the cube.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">I</kbd> in the 3D View. From the Insert Keyframe Menu, select LocRotScale.
To test the animation, press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Spacebar</kbd> to play.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
An armature in Blender can be thought of as similar to the armature of a real skeleton,
and just like a real skeleton an armature can consist of many bones.
These bones can be moved around and anything that they are attached to or
associated with will move and deform in a similar way.

An “armature” is a type of object used for rigging.
A rig is the controls and strings that move a marionette (puppet).
Armature object borrows many ideas from real-world skeletons.
<h2>Your First Armature</h2>
In order to see what we are talking about, let us try to add the default armature in Blender.
(Note that armature editing details are explained in

the <a href="bones/editing/index.html"><span class="blue">armatures editing section</span></a>.)
Open a default scene, then:
Delete all objects in the scene.
Make sure the cursor is in the world origin with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-C</kbd>.
Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Numpad1</kbd> to see the world in Front view.
Add a Single Bone (<span class="saddlebrown">Add ‣ Armature</span>).

Press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadDelete</kbd> to see the armature at maximum zoom.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_armatures_introduction_default.png" />
<span class="orange">The default armature.</span>
<h2>The Armature Object</h2>
As you can see, an armature is like any other object type in Blender:
It has an origin, a position, a rotation and a scale factor.

It has an Object Data data-block, that can be edited in Edit Mode.
It can be linked to other scenes, and the same armature data can be reused on multiple objects.
All animation you do in Object Mode is only working on the whole object,
not the armature's bones (use the Pose Mode to do this).
As armatures are designed to be posed, either for a static or animated scene,
they have a specific state, called “rest position”. This is the armature's default “shape”,

the default position/rotation/scale of its bones, as set in Edit Mode.
In Edit Mode, you will always see your armature in rest position,
whereas in Object Mode and Pose Mode,
you usually get the current “pose” of the armature
(unless you enable the Rest Position button of the Armature panel).

<span class="orange">Example of a very basic armature.</span>
Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by default) rigid elements.

But you have more possibilities than with real skeletons: In addition to the “natural” rotation of bones,
you can also move and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be connected to each other;
they can be completely free if you want. However,
the most natural and useful setups imply that some bones are related to others, forming so-called “chains of bones”,
which create some sort of “limbs” in your armature, as detailed in <a href="#chains-of-bones">Chains of Bones</a>.
<h2>Chains of Bones</h2>

The bones inside an armature can be completely independent from each other
(i.e. the modification of one bone does not affect the others).
But this is not often a useful set up: To create a leg,
all bones “after” the thigh bone should move “with” it in a well-coordinated manner.
This is exactly what happens in armatures by parenting a bone to the next one in the limb,
you create a “chains of bones”. These chains can be ramified. For example,

five fingers attached to a single “hand” bone.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_armatures_structure_chains-of-bones.png" />
<span class="orange">An armature with two chains of bones.</span>
Bones are chained by linking the tip of the parent to the root of the child.
Root and tip can be connected, i.e. they are always exactly at the same point;
or they can be free, like in a standard parent-child object relationship.

A given bone can be the parent of several children,
and hence be part of several chains at the same time.
The bone at the beginning of a chain is called its root bone,
and the last bone of a chain is the tip bone
(do not confuse them with similar names of bones' joints!).
Chains of bones are a particularly important topic in <a href="posing/index.html"><span class="blue">posing</span></a>

(especially with the standard forward kinematics versus “automatic” inverse kinematics posing techniques).
You create/edit them in Edit Mode, but except in case of connected bones,
their relationships have no effect on bone transformations in this mode
(i.e. transforming a parent bone will not affect its children).
The easiest way to manage bones relationships is to use
the <a href="bones/properties/relations.html#bone-relations-parenting"><span class="std std-ref">Relations panel</span></a> in the Bone tab.

The lattice should be scaled and moved to fit around your object in Object Mode.

Any scaling applied to the object in Edit Mode will result in the object deforming.
This includes applying its scale with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-A</kbd> as this will achieve the same result as

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Constraints are a way to control an object's properties
(e.g. its location, rotation, scale), using either plain static values
(like the <a href="transform/limit_location.html"><span class="blue">“limit” ones</span></a>),

or another object, called “target”
(like e.g. the <a href="transform/copy_location.html"><span class="blue">“copy” ones</span></a>).
Even though constraints are useful in static projects,
their main usage is obviously in animation.
You can control an object's animation through the targets used by its constraints
(this is a form of indirect animation). Indeed,

these targets can then control the constraint's owner's properties, and hence,
animating the targets will indirectly animate the owner.
You can animate constraints' settings. e.g. the Influence or
when using an armature's bone as target,
animate where along this bone (between root and tip) lays the real target point.
They can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball bouncing across the court,

allow the wheels on a bus to all rotate together,
help a dinosaur's legs bend at the knee automatically, and
make it easy for a hand to grip the hilt of a sword and the sword to swing with the hand.
Constraints, in Blender, work with <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-object"><span class="xref std std-term">Objects</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-bone"><span class="xref std std-term">Bones</span></a>.
Read about using constraints in rigging
in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/armatures/posing/bone_constraints/index.html"><span class="blue">Armature chapter</span></a>.

Constraints work in combination with each other to form a Constraint Stack.
<h2>Tips</h2>

Constraints are a fantastic way to add sophistication and complexity to a rig.
But be careful not to rush in too quickly, piling up constraint upon constraint
until you lose all sense of how they interact with each other.
Start simply. Get to know a single constraint inside and out.
<a href="transform/copy_location.html"><span class="blue">Copy Location Constraint</span></a> is a good first constraint to explore it
also has an animation example. Take the time to understand every fundamental concept behind it,

and the other constraints will make far more sense.
<h2>Actions
</h2>
When animating objects and properties in Blender, Actions record and contain the data.
As everything else in Blender, Actions are data-blocks.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_actions_data3.png" />

<span class="orange">Actions.</span>
So when you animate an object by changing its location with keyframes,
the animation is saved to the Action.
Each property has a channel which it is recorded to, for example,
Cube.location.x is recorded to Channel X Location.
The X location and Y location properties can be shared across multiple objects,

if all objects have X location and Y location properties beneath them.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_actions_keyframes.png" />

<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_actions_create.png" />

<span class="orange">The Action data-block menu.</span>
When you first animate an object by adding keyframes,
Blender creates an Action to record the data.
Actions can be managed with the Action data-block menu
in the Dope Sheet <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/dope_sheet/action.html"><span class="blue">Action Editor</span></a> header,
or the Sidebar region of the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/nla/properties_modifiers.html"><span class="blue">NLA Editor</span></a>.

If you are making multiple actions for the same object,
press the shield button for each action.
This will give the actions a Fake User and will make Blender save the unlinked actions.
Objects can only use one Action at a time for editing.
The <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/nla/index.html"><span class="blue">NLA Editor</span></a> is used to blend multiple actions together.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Drivers are a way to control values of properties by means of a function,
or a mathematical expression.
Effectively, drivers consist of:
A driver configuration that specifies zero, one, or more input values using
other properties or object transformation channels, and combines them using

a predefined mathematical function or a custom Python expression.
An animation <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html"><span class="blue">F-Curve</span></a>
that maps the output of the driver configuration to the final value to apply
to the driven property.
As an example, the rotation of Object 1 can be controlled by the scale of Object 2.
It is then said that the scale of Object 2 drives the rotation of Object 1.

Not only can drivers directly set the value of a property to the value of a different one,
they can also combine multiple values using a fixed function or a Python expression
and further modulate it with a manually defined curve and/or a modifier stack.
Drivers are an extremely powerful tool for building rigs and are typically used
to drive bone transforms and the influence of shape keys, action constraints and
modifiers, often using custom properties as inputs.

<h2>Graph View</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_introduction_fcurve.png" />
<span class="orange">Driver curve in the Drivers editor.</span>
The main area of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/drivers_editor.html"><span class="blue">Drivers editor</span></a>
shows an <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html"><span class="blue">F-Curve</span></a> that
represents the driver function.

The X axis maps to the output value of the driver configuration. The units depend on the setup.
The Y axis shows the value applied to the target property. The units depend on the property.
In the example image, if the driver value is 2.0 the property value will be 0.5.
The default F-curve is an identity map, i.e. the value produced by the driver configuration
is applied to the driven property unchanged. If the driver output value is 2.0,
the property will be 2.0.

The driver function can be defined artistically with Bézier curve handles or
mathematically with trigonometric functions or polynomial expressions such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y = a + bx\)</span>.
Furthermore, the function can also be procedurally modulated with noise or cyclic repetitions.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/modifiers.html"><span class="blue">Modifiers</span></a> for more details.
<h2>Driver Configuration</h2>
The <a href="drivers_panel.html"><span class="blue">Drivers panel</span></a> shows the setup for a driver.

A driver can have zero, one, or more variables. Variables specify which properties,
object transformation channels, or relative distances between objects, are used as inputs
by the driver.
The driver type determines how the variables are used. The type can be:
a built-in function: for example, the sum of the variables' values, or
a scripted expression: an arbitrary Python expression that refers to the variables by their names.

This driver configuration outputs a single value which changes when the variables change.
This value is then evaluated through the driver function curve to produce the result
to be applied to the driven property.
<h2>Notes on Scripted Expressions</h2>
When a driver uses a Scripted Expression, Blender can evaluate it without using
the fully featured Python interpreter if it is simple enough.

This means that drivers are fast to evaluate with simple divisions, additions and other “simple” expressions.
The built-in functions are always evaluated natively.
See <a href="drivers_panel.html#drivers-simple-expressions"><span class="std std-ref">Simple Expressions</span></a>
for a comprehensive list of expressions that can be evaluated natively.
When the expression is not simple, it will be evaluated using Python.
As a consequence, the driver will be slower and there is a security risk

if the author of the Python code is unknown.
This is an important thing to take into consideration for heavy scenes and
when sharing files with other people.
See also: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/advanced/scripting/security.html"><span class="blue">Auto run</span></a>.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Usage</span></h2>
Drivers can be added to properties via their context menu, a shortcut, copy-pasted,

or by typing an expression directly into the property's value.
After adding drivers, they are usually modified in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/drivers_editor.html"><span class="blue">Drivers editor</span></a>,
or via a simplified Edit Driver popover invoked from the property context menu.
<h2>Add Driver</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Context menu ‣ Add Driver</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-D</kbd></dd>
The usual way to add a driver to a property is to <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> click a property,
then choose Add Driver in the context menu.
Drivers can also be added by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-D</kbd> with the mouse over the property.

This operation adds a driver with a single variable (which needs to be filled in),
and displays the Edit Driver popover.
<h2>Edit Driver</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Context menu ‣ Edit Driver</span></dd>

Displays a popover window that allows editing the custom expression and input variables
of the driver without opening the full Drivers Editor.
Many drivers don't use their <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.html"><span class="blue">F-Curve</span></a>
component, so this reduced interface is sufficient.
<h2>Open Drivers Editor</h2>
Reference

<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Context menu ‣ Open Drivers Editor</span></dd>
Opens a new window with the Drivers Editor and
selects the driver associated with the property.
<h2>Copy &amp; Paste</h2>
Reference

<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Context menu ‣ Copy Driver</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><span class="saddlebrown">Context menu ‣ Paste Driver</span></dd>
Drivers can be copied and pasted via the context menu.
When adding drivers with the same settings, this can save time modifying settings.

<h2>Copy As New Driver</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Context menu ‣ Copy As New Driver</span></dd>
A driver that sets the property value to the value of a different property can be
quickly created by using the Copy As New Driver context menu option of the input

property, and then pasting the result onto the output property via Paste Driver.
It is also possible to add the new driver variable to an existing driver using
the <a href="drivers_panel.html#drivers-variables"><span class="std std-ref">Paste Driver Variables</span></a> button in the editor panel.
<h2>Expression</h2>
This is a quick way to add drivers with a scripted expression.
First click the property you want to add a driver to, then type a hash <code><span class="sapphire">#</span></code> and a scripted expression.

Some examples:
<code><span class="sapphire">#frame</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">#frame</span> <span class="sapphire">/</span> <span class="sapphire">20.0</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">#sin(frame)</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">#cos(frame)</span></code>

or as a popover when adding a driver to a property.
It shows the property that is being driven, followed by a series of settings
that determine how the driver works.

<h2>Driver Settings</h2>
<h3>Type</h3>
There are two categories of drivers:
Built-in functions (Average, Sum, Min and Max)
The driven property will have the value of the average, sum, lowest or highest (respectively)
of the values of the referenced Driver Variables.

If there is only one driver variable, these functions will yield the same result.
Custom (Scripted Expression).
An arbitrary Python expression that can refer to the Driver Variables by name. See <a href="#expressions">Expressions</a>.
<h3>Driver Value</h3>
The current result of the driver setup. Useful for debug purposes.
<h3>Variables</h3>

See  <a href="#driver-variables">Driver Variables</a>.
<h3>Update Dependencies</h3>
Forces an update for the Driver Value dependencies.
<h3>Show in Drivers Editor</h3>
Opens the fully featured <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/drivers_editor.html"><span class="blue">Drivers Editor</span></a>.
This button only appears in the popover version of the Drivers panel.

<h2>Driver Variables</h2>
Variables are references to properties, transformation channels, or the result of a comparison
between transformations of two objects.
Drivers should access object data via Driver Variables, rather than direct references in the Python expression,
in order for dependencies to be correctly tracked.

<dt>Quaternion</dt><dd>Provides the <a hreftps://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-quaternion"><span class="xref std std-term">Quaternion</span></a> representation of the rotation.</dd>
<dt>Swing and X/Y/Z Twist</dt><dd>Decomposes the rotation into two parts: a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-swing"><span class="xref std std-term">Swing</span></a> rotation that aims the specified
axis in its final direction, followed by a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-swing"><span class="xref std std-term">Twist</span></a> rotation around that axis.
This is often necessary for driving corrective <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shape_keys/index.html"><span class="blue">Shape Keys</span></a>

and bones for organic joint rotation.
This decomposition is often produced in rigs by using a helper bone with
a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/constraints/tracking/damped_track.html"><span class="blue">Damped Track Constraint</span></a>
to extract the swing part, and its child with
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/constraints/transform/copy_transforms.html"><span class="blue">Copy Transforms</span></a>
to extract the twist component.

The channels values for Swing and Y Twist are:

<span class="orange">Falloff curves for weighted angles.</span>
<dt>Y Rotation</dt><dd>True angle of the twist rotation.</dd>
<dt>W Rotation</dt><dd>True angle of the swing rotation, independen its direction.</dd>
<dt>X Rotation, Z Rotation</dt><dd>Weighted angles that represent the amount of swing around the X/Z axis.

The magnitude of the angle equals W Rotation when the rotation is purely around
that axis, and fades out to zero as the direction changes toward the other axis,
following the falloff curves from the graph on the right.</dd>
Mathematically, the swing angles are computed from quaternion components,
using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 \arccos(w)\)</span> for W and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 \arcsin(x)\)</span> etc. for the others.
The component of the swing rotation that corresponds to the twist axis is always 0,

and is replaced by the twist angle.</dd>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<dt>Expression</dt><dd>A text field where you can enter an arbitrary Python expression that refers to
Driver Variables by their names.
The expression has access to a set of standard constants and math functions provided
in the Driver Namespace. For an example of adding a custom function to the namespace,

see the <a href="workflow_examples.html#driver-namespace"><span class="std std-ref">driver namespace example</span></a>.
For performance reasons it is best to use the <a href="#simple-expressions">Simple Expressions</a> subset as much as possible.</dd>
<dt>Use Self</dt><dd>If this option is enabled, the variable <code><span class="sapphire">self</span></code> can be used for drivers to reference their own data.
Useful for objects and bones to avoid having creating a Driver Variable pointing to itself.
Example: <code><span class="sapphire">self.location.x</span></code> applied to the Y rotation property of the same object
will make the object tumble when moving.

Note that dependencies for properties accessed via <code><span class="sapphire">self</span></code> may not be fully tracked.</dd>
<h3>Simple Expressions</h3>
Blender can evaluate a useful subset of Python driver expressions directly,
which significantly improves performance, especially on multi-core systems.
To take advantage of this, the driver expression must only use the following features:
<dt>Variable Names</dt><dd>Use only ASCII characters.</dd>

<dt>Literals</dt><dd>Floating point and decimal integer.</dd>
<dt>Globals</dt><dd><code><span c="sapphire">frame</span></code></dd>
<dt>Constants</dt><dd><code><spaass="sapphire">pi</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">True</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">False</span></code></dd>
<dt>Operators</dt><dd><code><span class="sapphire">+</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">-</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">*</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">/</span></code>,
<code><span class="sapphire">==</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">!=</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;=</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">&gt;</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">&gt;=</span></code>,
<code><span class="sapphire">and</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">or</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">not</span></code>, conditional operator/ ternary if</dd>

<dt>Functions</dt><dd><code><span class="sapphire">min</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">max</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">radians</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">degrees</span></code>,
<code><span class="sapphire">abs</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">fabs</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">floor</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">ceil</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">trunc</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">int</span></code>,
<code><span class="sapphire">sin</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">cos</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">tan</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">asin</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">acos</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">atan</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">atan2</span></code>,
<code><span class="sapphire">exp</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">log</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">sqrt</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">pow</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">fmod</span></code></dd>
Simple expressions are evaluated even when Python script execution is disabled.
When an expression outside of this subset is used, Blender displays a “Slow Python expression”

warning. However, as long as the majority of drivers use simple expressions, using a complex
expression in select few is OK.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Workflow &amp; Examples</span></h2>
Simple Drivers can be configured from the pop-over that appears when adding a new Driver.
When adding multiple Drivers or for more advanced configurations,
it is useful to have open the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/drivers_editor.html"><span class="blue">Drivers Editor</span></a>.
<h2>Transform Driver</h2>
Control a property with an object's transform.

In this example, the Y rotation of Object 2 will be driven by the X position of Object 1.
Starting from a simple setup with two objects:
Add a Driver to the Rotation Y property of the second object via the context menu or with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-D</kbd>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_transform-driver-1.png" />
Open the Drivers Editor and select the Y Euler Rotation property in the channels region.
Open the Sidebar region and select the Drivers tab.

Configure the driver to be the Averaged Value of a Transform Channel of the first object.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_transform-driver-2.png" />
Experiment with moving the first object and notice how it affects the Y rotation of the second object.
<h2>Scripted Expression - Orbit a Point</h2>
Orbit an object's position around a point with a custom Scripted Expression.
The object's position will change when scrubbing the timeline.

Using trigonometry, circular motion can be defined in 2D using the sinus and cosine functions.
(See <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle">Unit Circle</a>.)
In this example, the current frame is used as the variable that induces the motion.
<code><span class="sapphire">frame</span></code> is a <a href="drivers_panel.html#drivers-simple-expressions"><span class="std std-ref">Simple Expression</span></a> that corresponds to
<code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context.scene.frame_current</span></code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_object-rotation.png" />

Add a driver to the X Location property.
Set the Driver Type to Scripted Expression.
Add the expression <code><span class="sapphire">0</span> <span class="sapphire">+</span> <span class="sapphire">(sin(frame</span> <span class="sapphire">/</span> <span class="sapphire">8)</span> <span class="sapphire">*</span> <span class="sapphire">4)</span></code>, where:
<code><span class="sapphire">frame/8</span></code> : is the current frame of the animation, divided by 8 to slow the orbit down.
<code><span class="sapphire">(sin(</span> <span class="sapphire">)*4)</span></code> : multiplies the result of <code><span class="sapphire">sin(frame/8)</span></code> by 4 for a bigger circle.
<code><span class="sapphire">0</span> <span class="sapphire">+</span></code> : is used to control the offset to the orbit center point.

Add a driver to the Y Location property with the expression <code><span class="sapphire">0</span> <span class="sapphire">+</span> <span class="sapphire">(cos(frame</span> <span class="sapphire">/</span> <span class="sapphire">8)</span> <span class="sapphire">*</span> <span class="sapphire">4)</span></code>.
Scrub the timeline to see the effect.
Experiment with the variables to control the size and center of the orbit.
<h2>Custom Function - Square Value</h2>
Create a custom function to get the square of a value (i.e. value<sup>2</sup>).
Adding the function to the Driver Namespace allows it to be used from driver expressions.

The Driver Namespace has a list of built-in functions for use in driver expressions,
as well as constants such as π and e.
These can be inspected via the Python Console:
<span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">driver_namespace</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39; &lt;tab&gt;</span>
<span class="go">                              acos&#39;]</span>
<span class="go">                              acosh&#39;]</span>

<span class="go">                              asin&#39;]</span>
<span class="go">                              asinh&#39;]</span>
<span class="go">                              atan&#39;]</span>
<span class="go">                              ...</span>
</pre>
To add a new function to the Driver Namespace, the function itself needs to be implemented

and then added to the <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.app.driver_namespace</span></code>.
Add the following to the Text Editor inside Blender and press Run Script.
<span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bpy</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">square</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Returns the square of the given value&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
   <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">val</span>

<span class="c1"># Add function to driver_namespace.</span>
<span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">driver_namespace</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;square&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">square</span>
</pre>
Add a driver with a Scripted Expression such as <code><span class="sapphire">square(frame)</span></code>.
Observe the effect when scrubbing the timeline.
There are more custom function examples available in Blender's Text Editor

<span class="saddlebrown">Templates ‣ Python ‣ Driver Functions</span>.
Since <a href="drivers_panel.html#drivers-simple-expressions"><span class="std std-ref">Simple Expressions</span></a> cannot access
custom functions, using them only makes sense for complex computations.
<h2>Shape Key Drivers</h2>
<h3>Improved Mesh Deformation</h3>
Fix intersection problems that happen when using armatures and weight painting, especially at joints.

Shape keys can also be used to tweak and refine a rig, for example to suggest muscle formations.
In this example, a shape key is used to improve the deformation at the elbow of a rudimentary arm.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_shape-key-improved-deformation.png" />
<span class="orange">Left: Skeletal mesh deformation without correction.
Right: Corrective shape key applied</span>
<dt>Setup</dt><dd>

Add a mesh (in this example, a cylinder with loop cuts).
Add an armature with a chain of bones.
Skin the mesh to the armature using weight painting.
(Note: to parent the mesh to the armature: select the mesh first,
then the armature and use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-P</kbd> to parent with auto weights.)</dd>
Experiment with posing the armature and observe the deformation at the joint.

To fix intersection problems or angles that look unsatisfactory,
you can associate a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shape_keys/index.html"><span class="blue">Shape Key</span></a> with a pose.
<dt>Shape Key</dt><dd>
Pose the armature such that the problems are visible.
Be sure to cover the extreme poses that you want to support for the rig.
With the mesh selected, add a new Shape Key in addition to the Basis key.

<span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Mesh tab ‣ Shape Keys</span>
In order to author the shape key on top of the armature deformation,
enable both Edit Mode Display and Cage Editing in the Armature modifier.
<span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Modifiers tab ‣ Armature Modifier ‣ Header</span>
Enter Edit Mode and select the new shape key in the properties panel.
Adjust the vertices as desired.

Select the Basis key to toggle between the original mesh and your edits.
(Note: be careful to apply edits only to your shape and not to
the original mesh or other existing keys.)
</dd>
Once you are satisfied with how the deformation looks for the problematic pose,
you'll need to configure a driver to activate the shape smoothly when entering that position.

<dt>Driver</dt><dd>
Add a driver to the Value of the shape key you've created.
Open the Drivers Editor and select the driver.
<dt>Method 1 – Direct mapping to a bone rotation value</dt><dd>A simple way to configure the driver is with a direct correspondence of
the value of a bone's rotation channel to the shape key activation Value.
This method has the disadvantage of relying on a single channel of a bone's

rotation which might be insufficient to precisely express the condition
under which the shape key should be activated.
In the Drivers tab, select the Averaged Value of the rotation of
the bone you're posing.
Understand the rotation axis that you're interested in by enabling axes display
in the armature or by observing the bone's transform values in the Properties.

Select the rotation channel and set it to local, meaning, the bone's
rotation value relative to its parent bone.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_shape-key-method1.png" />
Manually set points in the driver curve by selecting a handle and
dragging it or inserting values in the F-Curve tab.
The Y axis represents the shape key Value, which should go from 0.0 to 1.0.

The X axis is usually the frame, but for this driver it represents the rotation value in radians.
You can have more than two points in the curve and tweak the transitions
with the handles in the curve view (<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd> to move).
To verify that the driver behaves correctly, deselect the option to
only show drivers for selected objects. This way, you can pose the armature
and keep an eye on the driver.

</dd>
<dt>Method 2 – Rotational difference to a target bone</dt><dd>This method requires an additional target or corrective bone, but it
better expresses the spatial condition in 3D space of the bone that is
causing the problem.
In armature Edit Mode, add a new bone extruded from Bone 1,
in the position at which Bone 2 should have the shape key active.

This type of bones usually follow a naming convention such as
“TAR-” (target) or “COR-” (corrective).
In the Drivers tab, select the Averaged Value of the rotational difference
between the bone you're rotating and the target bone.
A rotational difference is the minimum angle between two objects in World Space.
It is therefore important that the bones have the same root,

so that the only thing affecting the angle between the bones is the rotation of one of them.
When the deformation bone (Bone 2) reaches the target rotation (TAR-Bone 2)
the rotational difference will be 0°.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_shape-key-method2.png" />
Manually adjust the driver curve handles so that the shape key Value
(Y axis) is 1.0 when the rotational difference (X axis) is 0°.

The Value should be 0.0 when the arm is extended, at which point
the rotational difference should be around 90° or more (in radians).
See the steps in Method 1 on how to adjust the curve handles and
confirm that the functionality is working. Pose the armature to
verify that the ranges are correct.
</dd></dd>

<h3>Chained Relative Shape Keys</h3>
Activate different shape keys in succession.
In this example, moving a single bone will activate first Key 1 and then Key 2.

<dt>Drivers</dt><dd>Add an armature with a single bone to control the shape keys.
The goal is to activate the keys in succession as this bone moves up.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_chained-shape-keys-result.png" />

As shown in the picture above, when the bone is halfway up, both Key 1 and Key 2 have an influence.
It is a matter of preference if Key 1 should be at its maximum Value before Key 2 starts to become active,
or how much they should overlap. This example shows a seamless blend.
For a seamless blend where there is overlap, Key 1 should have a Value of 0.0 when the bone
is at the bottom and increase linearly to 1.0 until the bone is past the midpoint height.
Key 2 should have a value of 0.0 before the midpoint height and then increase at the same

rate than Key 1 until reaching Value 1.0 when the bone is at maximum height.
Add a driver to the Value of Key 1 and Key 2.
In the Drivers tab, configure both drivers to be the Averaged Value of
a variable with the bone's Z location.
Determine the range of the bone's motion in the World Z axis by moving it up so that it is
aligned with the top of the mesh when both keys are active. Here we will use [0.0 , 2.5].

Configure the driver functions so that the Value of the shape keys (Y axis) is as
desired for the bone's height (X axis).
The driver functions should be linear, therefore, they can be defined analytically
with a function of type <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y = a + bx\)</span>,
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> is an offset in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> is the slope.
<blockquote>

In the Modifiers tab, add a Generator of type Extended Polynomial for both drivers.
Play with the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> so that the curves go from [0.0 , 1.0]
in the Y axis and from [0.0 , 2.5] in the X axis.
The curves should overlap in the mid area of the X axis and they should have the same slope (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>).
Possible values are Key 1: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y = 0.0 + 0.6x\)</span> and Key 2: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y = -0.5 + 0.6x\)</span>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_drivers_workflow-examples_chained-shape-keys-driver-setup.png" />

Note that the functions go outside the range [0.0 , 1.0] for the shape keys' Value,
but that has no effect because Value is clamped in a Range in the Shape Keys panel.

<h2>Rotational Properties are Radians</h2>
Parts of the User Interface may use different units of measurements for angles, rotation.
In the Graph Editor, while working with Drivers, all angles are Radians.

<h2
>Markers</h2>
Markers are used to denote frames with key points or significant events within an animation.
E.g. it could be that a character's animation starts, the camera changes position, or a door opens.
Markers can be given names to make them more meaningful at a quick glance.
They are available in many of Blender's editors.

Note
Unlike keyframes, markers are always placed at a whole frame number, you cannot set a marker at frame 2.5.
Markers can be created and edited in the following editors:

A marker created in one of these editors will also appear in all others that support them.
<h2>Types</h2>
Besides standard markers, pose markers are another type of markers,

which are specific to armatures and shape keys.
They are used to denote poses in the Action Editor mode and Shape Keys Editor of Dope Sheet.
<h2>Visualization</h2>
In the supported editors, if at least one is created, markers are visualized
in a separate row at their bottom.
This area can be disabled per editor via the <span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Show Markers</span> menu option.

Note
While the markers area is disabled, markers operators are not available in that editor,

Bind Camera to Markers is a special operator only available in the Timeline.
The operator allows markers to be used to set the active object as the active camera.

To use this operator, select the object to become the active camera
and select a marker to bind the active camera to.
If no marker is selected when the operator is preformed, a marker will be added.
When an object is bound to a marker, the marker will be renamed to the name of the active object.
These markers also have a camera icon next to the left of the name
to easily distinguish them from other informative markers

These markers can be moved to change the frame at which
the active camera is changed to the object the marker is bound to.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Shape keys are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation.
In other terminology, shape keys may be called “morph targets” or “blend shapes”.
The most popular use cases for shape keys are in character facial animation and
in tweaking and refining a skeletal rig.
They are particularly useful for modeling organic soft parts and muscles

where there is a need for more control over the resulting shape
than what can be achieved with combination of rotation and scale.
Shape keys can be applied on object types with vertices like mesh, curve, surface and lattice.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/animation_shape-keys_introduction_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Example of a mesh with different shape keys applied.</span>
<h2>Workflow</h2>

Shape keys are authored in the <a href="shape_keys_panel.html"><span class="blue">Shape Keys panel</span></a>
which is accessed in the Object Data tab of the Properties editor (e.g. the Mesh tab for mesh objects).
A shape key is modified by first selecting a shape key in the panel,
and then moving the object's vertices to a new position in the 3D Viewport.
The panel has controls for affecting the current Value (influence, weight) of a shape.
It is possible to see a shape in isolation or how it combines with others.

<h3>Adding and Removing Vertices</h3>
It is not possible to add or remove vertices in a shape key.
The number of vertices and how they connect is specified by the mesh, curve, surface or lattice.
A shape key merely records a position for each vertex and therefore shapes always
contain all the object's vertices.
When adding a vertex, all shape keys will record it with the position in which it is created.

Workflow-wise, adding and deleting vertices after creating shape keys is possible, but it is best
to leave the creation of shape keys for when the mesh is finished or its topology is stable.
<h3>Adding Shape Keys</h3>
When adding a new shape key with the <code><span class="sapphire">+</span></code> button next to the list,
the new shape will be a copy of the Basis shape,
independently of the current result visible in the 3D Viewport.

When adding a new shape key from <span class="saddlebrown">Specials ‣ New Shape from Mix</span>,
the shape will start of with the vertex configuration that is visible at that moment.
When doing facial animation with relative shape keys, it can be useful to first
create a shape key with a complex extreme pose (e.g. anger or surprise), and
then break this complex shape into components by applying a temporary vertex group to
the complex shape and creating a copy with New Shape from Mix.

This technique helps reducing conflicts between different shape keys
that would otherwise produce a double effect.
<h2>Relative or Absolute Shape Keys</h2>
A mesh (curve, surface or lattice) has a stack of shape keys.
The stack may be of Relative or Absolute type.
<dt>Relative</dt><dd>Mainly used for muscles, limb joints, and facial animation.

Each shape is defined relative to the Basis or to another specified shape key.
The resulting effect visible in the 3D Viewport, also called Mix,
is the cumulative effect of each shape with its current value.
Starting with the Basis shape, the result is obtained by adding
each shape's weighted relative offset to its reference key.
<dt>Value</dt><dd>Represents the weight of the blend between a shape key and its reference key.

A value of 0.0 denotes 100% influence of the reference key and 1.0 of the shape key.
Blender can extrapolate the blend between the two shapes above 1.0 and below 0.0.</dd>
<dt>Basis</dt><dd>Basis is the name given to the first (top-most) key in the stack.
The Basis shape represents the state of the object's vertices in their original position.
It has no weight value and it is not keyable.
This is the default Reference Key when creating other shapes.</dd></dd>

<dt>Absolute</dt><dd>Mainly used to deform the objects into different shapes over time.
Each shape defines how the object's shape will be at Evaluation Time specified in its Value.
The resulting shape, or Mix, is the interpolation of the previous and next shape
given the current Evaluation Time.
<dt>Value</dt><dd>Represents the Evaluation Time at which thhape key will be active.</dd>
<dt>Basis</dt><dd>Basis is the name given to the first (topmost) key in the stack.

<span class="orange">An animated cube with its motion path displayed.</span>
The Motion Paths tool allows you to visualize the motion of points as paths over a series of frames.
These points can be object origins and bone joints.
To create or remove motion paths, it is necessary to first select the bones. Then:
To show the paths (or update them, if needed), click on the Calculate Path button.
To hide the paths, click on the Clear Paths button.

Note
Remember that only selected bones and their paths are affected by these actions!
The paths are shown in a light shade of gray for unselected points,
and a slightly blueish gray for selected ones.
Around the current frame a glow indicate the direction of movement:
blue towards future frames and green towards the past.

Each frame is displayed by a small white dot on the paths.
The paths are automatically updated when you edit your poses/keyframes,
and they are also active during animation playback. Playing the animation
affects the paths only when the Around Current Frame option is enabled.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
The rigid body simulation can be used to simulate the motion of solid objects.
It affects the position and orientation of objects and does not deform them.
Unlike the other simulations in Blender, the rigid body simulation works closer with the animation system.

This means that rigid bodies can be used like regular objects and be part of parent-child relationships,
animation constraints and drivers.
<h2>Creating a Rigid Body</h2>
Right now only mesh objects can participate in the rigid body simulation.
To create rigid bodies, either click on Rigid Body button in the Physics tab of
the Properties editor or use the Add Active/Add Passive buttons in the Physics tab of the Toolbar.

There are two types of rigid body: active and passive. Active bodies are dynamically simulated, while passive
bodies remain static. Both types can be driven by the animation system when using the Animated option.
During the simulation,
the rigid body system will override the position and orientation of dynamic rigid body objects.
Note however, that the location and rotation of the objects are not changed,
so the rigid body simulation acts similar to a constraint.

To apply the rigid body transformations you can use
the Apply Object Transform operator.
The scale of the rigid body object also influences the simulation, but is always controlled by the animation system.
Rigid body physics on the object can be removed with the Rigid Body button
in the Physics tab in the Properties editor or in the <span class="saddlebrown">Object ‣ Rigid Body</span> menu.

<h2>Rigid Body Collisions</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Physics ‣ Rigid Body ‣ Collisions</span></dd>
<h3>Shape</h3>
The Shape option determines the collision shape of the object.

Primitive Shapes
These are best in terms of memory/performance but do not
necessarily reflect the actual shape of the object.
They are calculated based on the object's bounding box.
The center of gravity is always in the middle for now.
Primitive shapes can be shown in the viewport by

enabling Bounds in the <span class="saddlebrown">Object ‣ Display</span> panel.
<dt>Box</dt><dd>Box-like shapes (e.g. cubes), including planes (e.g. ground planes).
The size per axis is calculated from the bounding box.</dd>
<dt>Sphere</dt><dd>Sphere-like shapes. The radius is the largest axi the bounding box.</dd>
<dt>Capsule</dt><dd>This points up the Z axis.</dd>
<dt>Cylinder</dt><dd>This points up the Z axis.

<dt>Cone</dt><dd>This points up the Z axis.
The height is taken from the Z axis, while the radius is the larger of the X or Y axes.</dd>
Mesh-Based Shapes
These are calculated based on the geometry of the object so they are a better representation of the object.
The center of gravity for these shapes is the object origin.

<dt>Convex Hull</dt><dd>A mesh-like surface encompassing (e.g. shrink-wrap over) all vertices (best results with fewer vertices).
A convex approximation of the object, has a good performance and stability.</dd>
<dt>Mesh</dt><dd><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-mesh"><span class="xref std std-term">Mesh</span></a> consisting of triangles only, allowing for more detailed interactions than convex hulls.
Allows to simulate concave objects, but is rather slow and unstable.</dd>
<h3>Source</h3>
Users can now specify the mesh Source for Mesh bases collision shapes:

<dt>Base</dt><dd>The base mesh of the object.</dd>
<dt>Deform</dt><dd>Includes any deformations added to the mesh (shape keys, deform modifiers).
<dt>Deforming</dt><dd>Mesh shapes can deform during simulation.</dd></dd>
<dt>Final</dt><dd>Includes all deformations and modifiers.</dd>
<h3>Surface Response</h3>
<dt>Friction</dt><dd>Resistance of object to movement. Specifies much velocity is lost when objects collide with each other.</dd>

<dt>Bounciness</dt><dd>Tendency of object to bounce after colliding with another (0 to 1) (rigid to perfectly elastic).
Specifies how much objects can bounce after collisions.</dd>
<h3>Sensitivity</h3>
<dt>Margin</dt><dd>Threshold of distance near surface where collis are still considered (best results when non-zero).</dd>
The collision margin is used to improve the performance and stability of rigid bodies.
Depending on the shape, it behaves differently: some shapes embed it,

while others have a visible gap around them.
The margin is embedded for these shapes:
Sphere
Box
Capsule
Cylinder

Convex Hull: Only allows for uniform scale when embedded.
The margin is not embedded for these shapes:
Cone
Active Triangle Mesh
Passive Triangle Mesh: Can be set to 0 most of the time.

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Scene ‣ Rigid Body World</span></dd>
The Rigid Body World is a group of rigid body objects,

which holds settings that apply to all rigid bodies in this simulation.
When you add rigid body physics on an object,
primary there is created a group of objects with default “RigidBodyWorld” name.
Rigid body objects automatically are added to this group when you add rigid body physics for them.
You can create several Rigid Body World groups and allocate the rigid body objects
with the Groups panel in the Object tab.

Rigid body objects and constraints are only taken into account by the simulation
if they are in the collection specified in the Collection field of the Rigid Body World panel in the Scene tab.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Tips</span></h2>
As with all physics-enabled objects, pay close attention to the Animated checkbox
in the Rigid Body panel of the Physics tab in the Properties editor.
A common mistake is to use keyframe animation on a Passive physics
object without checking the Animated box. The object will move,
but the physics engine will behave as if the Passive is still in its starting place, leading to disappointment.

<h2>Animation</h2>
The most common trick is to
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-keyframe"><span class="xref std std-term">keyframe</span></a> animate the location or rotation of an Active physics object as well as
the Animated checkbox.
When the curve on the Animated property switches to disabled, the physics engine takes over
using the object's last known location, rotation and velocities.

Animating the strengths of various other parameters
(a <a href="constraints/types/motor.html"><span class="blue">Motor's</span></a> Target Velocity,
a <a href="constraints/types/hinge.html"><span class="blue">Hinge's</span></a> limits, etc.)
can be used to accomplish a wide variety of interesting results.
Enabling a constraint during the physics simulation often has dramatic results
as the physics engine tries to bring into alignment two objects which are often dramatically out of alignment.

It is very common for the affected objects to build up enough kinetic energy to bounce themselves out of camera
(and into orbit, although the physics engine is not yet capable of
simulating a planet's gravity well, so scratch that).
Rigid body dynamics can be baking to normal keyframes with Bake To Keyframes button
in the Physics tab of the Toolbar.
<h2>Simulation Stability</h2>

The simplest way of improving simulation stability is to increase the steps per second.
However, care has to be taken since making too many steps can cause problems and
make the simulation even less stable
(if you need more than 1000 steps, you should look at other ways to improve stability).
Increasing the number of solver iterations helps making constraints stronger and
also improves object stacking stability.

It is best to avoid small objects, as they are currently unstable.
Ideally, objects should be at least 20 cm in diameter.
If it is still necessary, setting the collision margin to 0,
while generally not recommended, can help making small object behave more naturally.
When objects are small and/or move very fast, they can pass through each other.
Besides what is mentioned above it's also good to avoid using mesh shapes in this case.

Mesh shapes consist of individual triangles and therefore do not
really have any thickness, so objects can pass through more easily.
You can give them some thickness by increasing the collision margin.
<h2>Combining Rigid Bodies with Other Simulations</h2>
Since the rigid body simulation is part of the animation system,
it can influence other simulations just like the animation system can.

In order for this to work, the rigid body object needs to have a Collision Modifier.
Simply click on Collision in the Physics tab.
<h2>Scaling Rigid Bodies</h2>
Rigid body objects can be scaled, also during the simulation.
This work well in most cases, but can sometimes cause problems.
If dynamic scaling is not needed, rigid body objects should have the scale applied by

using the Apply Scale tool <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-A</kbd>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Cloth simulation is one of the hardest aspects of computer graphics,
it is a deceptively simple real-world item that is taken for granted,

but it actually has very complex internal and environmental interactions.
Cloth is commonly modeled as 2D mesh to simulate real world objects such as fabrics, flags, banners.
And yet cloth can also be used to model 3D objects such as teddy bears, pillows, balloons, or balls.
Cloth interacts with and is affected by other moving objects,
the wind and other forces, as well as a general aerodynamic model,
all of which is under your control.

</table>
Once Cloth physics have been added to a mesh, a Cloth <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/modifiers/index.html"><span class="blue">modifier</span></a>
will be added to the object's modifier stack. As a modifier then,

it can interact with other modifiers, such as Armature and Smooth. In these cases,
the ultimate shape of the mesh is computed in accordance with the order of the modifier stack.
For example, you should smooth the cloth after the modifier computes the shape of the cloth.
You can Apply the Cloth Modifier to freeze, or lock in,
the shape of the mesh at that frame, which removes the modifier. For example,
you can drape a flat cloth over a table, let the simulation run, and then apply the modifier.

In this sense, you are using the simulator to save yourself a lot of modeling time.
Results of the simulation are saved in a cache, so that the shape of the mesh,
once calculated for a frame in an animation, does not have to be recomputed again.
If changes to the simulation are made, you have full control over clearing the cache and re-running the simulation.
Running the simulation for the first time is fully automatic and no baking or separate step interrupts the workflow.
Computation of the shape of the cloth at every frame is automatic and done in the background;

thus you can continue working while the simulation is computed. However, it is CPU-intensive
and depending on the power of your PC and the complexity of the simulation,
the amount of CPU needed to compute the mesh varies, as does the lag you might notice.
Note
Do Not Jump Ahead
If you set up a cloth simulation but Blender has not computed the shapes for the duration of the simulation,

and if you jump ahead a lot of frames forward in your animation,
the cloth simulator may not be able to compute or show you an accurate mesh shape for that frame,
if it has not previously computed the shape for the previous frame(s).
<h2>Workflow</h2>
A general process for working with cloth is to:
Model the cloth object as a general starting shape.

Designate the object as a “cloth” in the Physics tab of the Properties editor.
Model other deflection objects that will interact with the cloth.
Ensure the Deflection modifier is last on the modifier stack, after any other mesh deforming modifiers.
Light the cloth and assign materials and textures, UV unwrapping if desired.
If desired, give the object particles, such as steam coming off the surface.
Run the simulation and adjust settings to obtain satisfactory results.

The Timeline editors playback controls are great for this step.
Optionally age the mesh to some point in the simulation to obtain a new default starting shape.
Make minor edits to the mesh on a frame-by-frame basis to correct minor tears.
Tip
To avoid unstable simulation, make sure that the cloth object does not penetrate any of the deflection objects.
<h2>Springs</h2>

Internally, cloth physics is simulated with virtual springs that connect the vertices of a mesh.
There are four types of springs that control how the cloth bends.
These four types are defined below and illustrated in the following image:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_cloth_introduction_springs.png" />
<span class="orange">Illustration of cloth springs; tension springs (blue),

control surface springs, optionally, internal springs can be used for 3D meshes
and behave similarly to <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/soft_body/index.html"><span class="blue">Soft Bodies</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Examples</span></h2>

To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric. So,
let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some good floppy and flexible fabric,
you will need to subdivide it several times, about eight is a good number.
So <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> into Edit Mode and subdivide the mesh a couple of times.
Now, we will make this cloth by going to the Physics tab.
Scroll down until you see the Cloth panel, and press the Cloth button.

Now, a lot of settings will appear, most of which we will ignore for now.
That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating,
but if you playback the animation, the drop of your newly created fabric will be quite unspectacular.
That is what we will cover in the next two sections about pinning and colliding.
<h2>Using Simulation to Shape/Sculpt a Mesh</h2>
You can Apply the Cloth Modifier at any point to freeze the mesh in

position at that frame. You can then re-enable the cloth,
setting the start and end frames from which to run the simulation forward.
Another example of aging is a flag.
Define the flag as a simple grid shape and pin the edge against the flagpole.
Simulate for 50 frames or so, and the flag will drop to its “rest” position.
Apply the Cloth Modifier.

If you want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene,
re-enable it for the frame range when it is in camera view.
<h2>Smoothing of Cloth</h2>
Now, if you followed this from the previous section, your cloth is probably looking a little blocky.
In order to make it look nice and smooth like the picture you need to apply
a Smooth and/or Subdivision Surface Modifier in the Modifiers tab.

Then, in the Toolbar, find the Edit panel and Press Smooth.
<h2>Cloth on Armature</h2>
Clothing can be simulated and pinned to an armature.
For example, a character could have a baggy tunic pinned to the character's waist with a belt.
The typical workflow for pinning:
Set the armature to its bind pose.

Model clothing that encloses but does not penetrate the character's mesh.
Parent the clothing objects to the armature. The armature will now have several child meshes bound to it.
Create a new vertex group on each cloth object for its pinned vertices.
Add vertices to be pinned to this vertex group and give these vertices non-zero weights
(you probably want weight = 1).
For example the belt area of the tunic would be in the vertex group and have weight one.

Designate the clothing objects as “cloth” in the Physics tab of the Properties editor.
Make sure the Cloth Modifier is below the Armature Modifier in the modifier stack.
In the cloth Shape panel select the vertex group.
Add <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/collision.html"><span class="blue">collision physics</span></a> to the character's mesh.
The clothing is now ready; non-pinned vertices will be under control of the Cloth modifier.
Pinned vertices will be under control of the Armature modifier.

Note
When animating or posing the character you must begin from the bind pose.
Move the character to its initial pose over several frames so the physics engine can simulate the clothing moving.
Very fast movements and teleport jumps can break the physics simulation.

<h2>Cloth with Animated Vertex Groups</h2>

Cloth with animated pinned vertices:
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/File:Cloth_anim_vertex.blend">Regression blend-file</a>.
Unsupported: Starting with a goal of 0 and increasing it,
but still having the vertex not pinned will not work (e.g. from goal = 0 to goal = 0.5).
<h2>Cloth with Dynamic Paint</h2>
Cloth with Dynamic Paint using animated vertex groups:

<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/File:Cloth_dynamic_paint.blend">Regression blend-file</a>.
Unsupported: Starting with a goal of 0 and increasing it, but still having the vertex not pinned will not work
(e.g. from goal = 0 to goal = 0.5) because the necessary “goal springs” cannot be generated on-the-fly.
<h2>Using Cloth for Soft Bodies</h2>

Cloth can also be used to simulate soft bodies.
It is for sure not its main purpose but it works nonetheless.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Soft body simulation is used for simulating soft deformable objects.
It was designed primarily for adding secondary motion to animation,
like jiggle for body parts of a moving character.

It also works for simulating more general soft objects that bend, deform and
react to forces like gravity and wind, or collide with other objects.
While it can simulate cloth and other stiff types of deformable objects to
an extent, the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/cloth/index.html"><span class="blue">Cloth Simulation</span></a> can do it better
with a solver specifically designed for this purpose.
The simulation works by combining existing animation on the object with forces

acting on it. There are exterior forces like gravity or force fields and
interior forces that hold the vertices together.
This way you can simulate the shapes that an object would take on in reality if it had volume,
was filled with something, and was acted on by real forces.
Soft bodies can interact with other objects through Collision.
They can interact with themselves through Self-Collision.

The result of the soft body simulation can be converted to a static object.
You can also bake edit the simulation, i.e.
edit intermediate results and run the simulation from there.
<h2>Typical Scenarios for using Soft Bodies</h2>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_soft-body_introduction_windcone.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_soft-body_introduction_windcone.jpg" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">The wind cone is a soft body, as the suspension.</span>

<a class="reference external" href="https://vimeo.com/1865817">Animation</a>
Soft bodies are well suited for:
Jiggle on moving characters.
Elastic and deformable objects made of materials like rubber or gelatin.
Tree branches moving in the wind, swinging ropes, and the like.
Flags, wide sleeves, cushions or other simple fabric reacting to forces.

<h2>Creating a Soft Body</h2>
Soft body simulation works for all objects that have vertices or control points
(meshes, curves, surfaces, and lattices).

To add a soft body simulation to an object,
go to the Physics tab (bouncing ball icon) in the Properties editor
and activate the Soft Body button.
For a reference of all the settings see <a href="settings.html"><span class="blue">this page</span></a>.
You start a soft body simulation by playback animation with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-A</kbd>,
and stop the simulation with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-A</kbd>.

<h2>Interaction in Real-Time</h2>
To work with a soft body simulation, you will find it handy to use the Timeline editor.
You can change between frames and the simulation will always be shown in the actual state.
You can interact in real-time with the simulation,
e.g. by moving collision objects or shaking a soft body object.
You can then select the soft body object while running the simulation and Apply

the modifier in the Modifiers tab of the Properties editor.
This makes the deformation permanent.
<h2>Tips</h2>
Soft bodies work especially well if the objects have an even vertex distribution.
You need enough vertices for good collisions. You change the deformation
(the stiffness) if you add more vertices in a certain region.

The calculation of collisions may take a long time. If something is not visible, why calculate it?
To speed up the collision calculation it is often useful to collide with an additional,
simpler, invisible, somewhat larger object.
Use soft bodies only where it makes sense.
If you try to cover a body mesh with a tight piece of cloth and animate solely with soft body,
you will have no success. Self-collision of soft body hair may be activated,

but that is a path that you have to wander alone. We will deal with
<a href="collision.html"><span class="blue">Collisions</span></a> in detail later.
Try and use a Lattice or a Curve Guide soft body instead of the object itself. This may be magnitudes faster.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Collision</span></h2>
There are two different collision types that you may use:
collision between different objects and internal collision.

We should set one thing straight from the start –
the primary targets of the collision calculation are the vertices of a soft body.
So if you have too few vertices too few collision takes place.
Secondarily, you can use edges and faces to improve the collision calculation.
<h2>Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
For a soft body to collide with another object there are a few prerequisites:

If Collision Collection is set, the object must belong to the collection.
The collision object has to be a mesh object.
You have to activate the Collision in the Physics tab for the collision object.
The collision object may also be a soft body.
<h3>Examples</h3>
A soft body cube colliding with a plane (Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-collision-plane1"><span class="std std-ref">A soft body cube colliding with a plane.</span></a>)

works pretty well, but a soft body plane falls right through a cube
that it is supposed to collide with (Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-collision-plane2"><span class="std std-ref">A soft body plane colliding with a cube, so no interaction at all.</span></a>).

</table>
Why is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see if the four vertices
of the soft body plane collides with the cube as the plane is pulled down by gravity.
You can activate Collision: Face (in the Soft Body Edges panel) to enable collision between
the face of the plane and the object instead, but this type of calculation takes much longer.
Let us have a closer look at the collision calculation, so you can get an idea of how we might optimize it.

<h3>Calculating Collisions</h3>
Soft body simulations are by default done on a per-vertex basis. If the vertices of the soft body
do not collide with the collision object, there will be no interaction between the two objects.
In the video below, you can see the vertices colliding with a plane.
If a vertex penetrates the zone between Outer and Inner, it is repulsed by a force in
the direction of the face normal. The position that a vertex finally ends up in is dependent

on the forces that act upon it. In the example (the first vertex on the left in the video below)
gravity and the repulsion force of the face balance out.
The speed at which the vertex is pulled out of the collision zone is influenced by the Choke parameter
in the <a href="settings.html#physics-softbody-settings-solver"><span class="std std-ref">Soft Body Solver settings</span></a>.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YnerUKP1ptQ" style="border: 0; height: 345px; width: 560px">
</iframe>

Download the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.blender.org/uploads/8/8d/CollidingVertices.blend">blend-file</a>.
Now let's see what happens if we make vertices heavier and let them travel at a faster speed.
In the video above, you can see vertices traveling at different speeds.
The two on the far right (fifth and sixth) are traveling so fast that they pass right through
the collision zone (this is because of the default solver precision, which we can fix later).

You will notice that the fourth vertex also travels quite fast and because it is heavier
it breaches the inner zone. The first three vertices collide correctly.
You can set up your collision so that edges and even faces are included in the collision calculation
in the Soft Body Edges panel with the Collision Face and Edge options.
The collision is then calculated differently. It is checked whether the edge or face
intersects with the collision object, the collision zones are not used.

<h3>Good Collisions</h3>
If the collision you have set up is not behaving properly, you can try the following:
The soft body object must have more subdivisions than the collision object.
Add loop cuts to the soft body object in strategic areas that
you know are most likely to be involved in a collision.
Check the direction of the face normals.

If the collision object has sharp spikes, they might penetrate the soft body.
The resolution of the solver must match the speed at which soft body vertices are traveling.
Lower the parameter Error Limit and carefully increase Min Step.
Outer and Inner should be large enough, but zones of opposite faces should not overlap,
or you have forces in opposite directions.
If you use strong forces you should use large zones.

Set Choke to a high enough value (all the way up if necessary) if you have difficulties with repelled vertices.
Colliding faces are difficult to control and need long calculation times. Try not to use them.
Often it is better to create a simplified mesh to use as your collision object,
however, this may be difficult if you are using an animated mesh.
<h2>Self-Collisions</h2>
For information on self-collision please refer to

the <a href="settings.html#physics-softbody-settings-self-collision"><span class="std std-ref">Self-Collision</span></a> settings.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Examples</span></h2>
Here are some simple examples showing the power of soft body physics.
<h2>A Bouncing Cube</h2>
<h3>The Process</h3>
First, change your start and end frames to 1 and 150.

Then, add a plane, and scale it five times. Next, go to the physics tab, and add a collision.
The default settings are fine for this example.
Now add a cube, or use the default cube, then enter Edit Mode to subdivide it three times.
Add a Bevel Modifier to it to smoothen the edges and then to add a little more,
press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">R</kbd> twice, and move your cursor a bit.
When finished, your scene should look like this:

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_soft-body_examples_scene-ready.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_soft-body_examples_scene-ready.png" style="width: 520px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">The scene, ready for soft body physics.</span>
Everything is ready to add the soft body physics.
Go to <span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Physics</span> and choose Soft Body.
Uncheck the Soft Body Goal, and check Soft Body Self Collision.
Also, under Soft Body Edges, increase the Bending to 10.

Playing the animation will now give a slow animation of a bouncing cube.
To speed things up, we need to bake the soft body physics.
Under Soft Body Cache change the values of your start and end frames. In this case 1 and 150.
Now, to test if everything is working, you can take a cache step of 5 or 10,
but for the final animation it is better to reduce it to 1, to cache everything.
You can now bake the simulation, give the cube materials and textures and render the animation.

<h3>The Result</h3>

<h2>Liquid Simulations</h2>
Fluid physics are used to simulate physical properties of liquids especially water.

While creating a scene in Blender, certain objects can be marked to become a part of the fluid simulation.
For a fluid simulation you have to have a domain to define the space that the simulation takes up.
In the domain settings you will be able to define the global simulation parameters (such as viscosity
and gravity).

<span class="orange">Example of a liquid simulation.</span>

<h2>Gas Simulations</h2>
Gas or smoke simulations are a subset of the fluids system, and can be used for simulating collections
of airborne solids, liquid particulates and gases, such as those that make up smoke.
It simulates the fluid movement of air and generates animated <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-voxel"><span class="xref std std-term">voxel</span></a>
textures representing the density, heat, and velocity of other fluids or suspended particles
(e.g. smoke) which can be used for rendering.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_fluid_introduction_fire-example.png" />
<span class="orange">Example of a fire simulation.</span>
Gases or smoke are emitted inside of a <a href="type/domain/index.html"><span class="blue">Domain</span></a>
from a mesh object or particle system.
The smoke movement is controlled by airflow inside the domain, which can be influenced by
<a href="type/effector.html"><span class="blue">Effector</span></a> objects. Smoke will also be affected by the scene's

gravity and <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/forces/force_fields/index.html"><span class="blue">force fields</span></a>.
Airflow inside the domain can affect other physics simulations via the Smoke Flow force field.
<h2>Workflow</h2>
At least a <a href="type/domain/index.html"><span class="blue">Domain</span></a> object and
one <a href="type/flow.html"><span class="blue">Flow</span></a> object are required to create a fluid simulation.
Create a <a href="type/domain/index.html"><span class="blue">Domain object</span></a>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>

Particles are lots of items emitted from mesh objects, typically in the thousands.
Each particle can be a point of light or a mesh, and be joined or dynamic.
They may react to many different influences and forces, and have the notion of a lifespan.
Dynamic particles can represent fire, smoke, mist,
and other things such as dust or magic spells.
<a href="hair/index.html"><span class="blue">Hair</span></a> type particles are a subset of regular particles.

Hair systems form curves that can represent hair, fur, grass and bristles.
You see particles as a Particle Modifier,
but all settings are done in the Particle tab.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_particles_introduction_fur-example.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_particles_introduction_fur-example.jpg" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Some fur made from particles.</span>
Particles generally flow out from their mesh into space.

Their movement can be affected by many things, including:
Initial velocity out from the mesh.
Movement of the emitter (vertex, face or object) itself.
Movement according to “gravity” or “air resistance”.
Influence of force fields like wind, vortexes or guided along a curve.
Interaction with other objects like collisions.

Partially intelligent members of a flock (herd, school, …),
that react to other members of their flock, while trying to reach a target or avoid predators.
Smooth motion with soft body physics (only Hair particle systems).
Or even manual transformation with <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.html"><span class="blue">Lattices</span></a>.
Particles may be rendered as:
<a href="emitter/render.html#particle-halo"><span class="std std-ref">Halos</span></a> (for Flames, Smoke, Clouds).

Meshes which in turn may be animated (e.g. fish, bees, …).
In these cases, each particle “carries” another object.
<a href="hair/shape.html"><span class="blue">Hair curves</span></a>, following the path of the particle.
These hair curves can be manipulated in the 3D View (combing, adding, cutting, moving, etc.).
Every object may carry many particle systems. Each particle system may contain up to
10.000.000 particles. Certain particle types (Hair and Keyed)

may have up to 10.000 children for each particle
(children move and emit more or less like their respective parents).
The size of your memory and your patience are your practical boundaries.

<h2>Workflow</h2>
The process for working with standard particles is:

Create the mesh which will emit the particles.
Create one or more Particle Systems to emit from the mesh. Many times, multiple
particle systems interact or merge with each other to achieve the overall desired effect.
Tailor each Particle System's settings to achieve the desired effect.
Animate the base mesh and other particle meshes involved in the scene.
Define and shape the path and flow of the particles.

For <a href="hair/index.html"><span class="blue">Hair</span></a> particle systems: Sculpt the emitter's flow
(cut the hair to length and comb it for example).
Make final render and do physics simulation(s), and tweak as needed.
<h3>Creating a Particle System</h3>
To add a new particle system to an object, go to the Particles tab of the Properties
editor and click the small <code><span class="sapphire">+</span></code> button. An object can have many Particle Systems.

Each particle system has separate settings attached to it.
These settings can be shared among different particle systems, so one does not have to copy
every setting manually and can use the same effect on multiple objects.
<h4>Types of Particle Systems</h4>
<span class="target" id="fig-particle-intro-system-type"></span>After you have created a particle system,
the Properties editor fills with many panels and buttons.

But do not panic! There are two different types of particle systems,
and you can change between these two with the Type selector:
Emitter and Hair.
The settings in the Particle System tab are partially different for each system type.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Particle Edit Mode</span></h2>
Using Particle Edit Mode you can edit the keyed points (keyframes)
and paths of Baked
<a href="hair/index.html"><span class="blue">Hair</span></a>,
<a href="index.html"><span class="blue">Particle</span></a>,

<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/cloth/index.html"><span class="blue">Cloth</span></a>, and
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/soft_body/index.html"><span class="blue">Soft Body</span></a> simulations.
(You can also edit and style hair before baking.)
Since working in Particle Edit Mode is pretty easy and very similar
to working with vertices in the 3D View, we will show how to set up
a particle system and then give a reference of the various functions.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Tip
Only Frames Baked to Memory are Editable!
If you cannot edit the particles, check that you are not baking to
a <a href="emitter/cache.html"><span class="blue">Disk Cache</span></a>.
<h3>Setup for Hair Particles</h3>

Create a Hair particle system.
Give it an initial velocity in the Normal direction.
Create a simulation.
Check the Hair Dynamics box.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_particles_mode_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Editing hair strands in Particle Edit Mode.</span>

<h3>Setup for Particle, Cloth, and Soft Body Simulations</h3>
Use Emitter particles, or a cloth/soft body simulation.
Create a simulation by setting up objects and or emitters,
set your time range (use a small range if you are just starting out and experimenting),
set up the simulation how you want it, using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-A</kbd> to preview it.
<h3>Bake the Simulation</h3>

Once you are happy with the general simulation, <a href="emitter/cache.html"><span class="blue">bake</span></a>
the simulation from Object Mode. The simulation must be baked to enable editing.
<h3>Edit the Simulation</h3>
Switch to Particle Edit from the Mode select menu in the header of the 3D View
to edit the particle's paths/Keyframes. You may need to press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">T</kbd> from within the 3D View
to see the Particle Edit panel. Move to the frame you want to edit and use the various Particle Edit

tools to edit your simulation. Work slowly, previewing your changes with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-A</kbd>,
and save often so that you can go back to the previous version should something happen,
or that you do not like the latest changes you have made.
Tip
To be able to clearly see what you are working on:
Open the Options panel in the Toolbar.

Select Point select mode (see below) in the header of the 3D View.
This will display key points along the particle path.
<h2>Selecting</h2>
Single: <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>.
All: <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>.
Linked: Move the mouse over a keypoint and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd>.

Box select: <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">B</kbd>.
Root/Tips: <span class="saddlebrown">Select ‣ Roots / Tips</span>.
You may also use the Select Menu.
Tip
Selections
Selections are extremely useful for modifying only the particles that you want.

Hover over a particle path and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd> to link-select it,
hover over the next and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd> to add that path to the selection.
To remove a path, hold <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd>. To Deselect all press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>.
The method to select individual points is the same as in Edit Mode.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> to select, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-RMB</kbd> to add/remove a point from the selection.

<h2>Editing</h2>
<h3>Moving Keypoints or Particles</h3>
To move selected keypoints press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd>, or use one of the various other methods to move vertices.

To move a particle root you have to turn off Keep Root in the Toolbar.
You can do many of the things like with vertices, including scaling,
rotating and removing (complete particles or single keys).
You may not duplicate or extrude keys or particles,
but you can subdivide particles which adds new keypoints
<span class="saddlebrown">Particle ‣ Subdivide</span>.

Alternatively you can rekey a particle
<span class="saddlebrown">Particle ‣ Rekey</span>.
How smoothly the hair and particle paths are displayed depends on the Path Steps
setting in the Toolbar. Low settings produce blocky interpolation between points,
while high settings produce a smooth curve.
<h3>Mirror</h3>

If you want to create an X axis symmetrical haircut you have to do following steps:

Select all particles with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>.
Mirror the particles with <span class="saddlebrown">Particle ‣ Mirror</span>.
Turn on X Mirror in <span class="saddlebrown">Sidebar Region ‣ Tool ‣ Options</span>.
It may happen that after mirroring two particles occupy nearly the same place.
Since this would be a waste of memory and render time,
you can use Merge by Distance from the Particle menu.

Hiding and unhiding of particles works similar as with vertices in the 3D View.
Select one or more keypoints of the particle you want to hide and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">H</kbd>.
The particle in fact does not vanish, only the key points.
Hidden particles (i.e. particles whose keypoints are hidden)
do not react on the various brushes. But:

If you use Mirror Editing even particles with hidden keypoints may be moved,
if their mirrored counterpart is moved.
To unhide all hidden particles press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-H</kbd>.

Dynamic paint is a modifier and physics system that can turn objects into paint canvases
and brushes, creating vertex colors, image sequences or displacement.
This makes many effects possible like, for example footsteps in the snow,
raindrops that make the ground wet, paint that sticks to walls, or objects that gradually freeze.
<h2>Activating the Modifier</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_introduction_activate.png" />
<span class="orange">How to activate the Dynamic Paint.</span>
Dynamic Paint can be activated from the “Physics” tab of the “Properties” editor.
<h2>Types</h2>
Modifier itself has two different types
<a href="canvas.html"><span class="blue">Canvas</span></a> and <a href="brush.html"><span class="blue">Brush</span></a>.

Note
You can also enable brush and canvas simultaneously.
In that case same object's “brush” does not influence its “canvas”,

<h3>Surface Type</h3>
Each surface has a “type” that defines what surface is used for.

<h4>Paint</h4>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-paint.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-paint.jpg" style="width: 320px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Paint Surface.</span>
Paint is the basic surface type that outputs color and wetness values.
In case of vertex surfaces, results are outputted as vertex colors.
A wetmap is a black-and-white output that visualizes paint wetness. White being maximum wetness,

black being completely dry. It is usually used as mask for rendering.
Some “paint effects” affect wet paint only.
<dt>Dry</dt><dd>Completely disable drying is useful for indefinitely spreading paint.
<dt>Color Dry</dt><dd>It can be used to define wetness level when paint colors start to shift to surface “background”.
Lower values can be useful to prevent spreading paint from becoming transparent as it dries,
while higher values give better results in general.</dd></dd>

<h4>Displace</h4>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-displace.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-displace.jpg" style="width: 320px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Displace Surface.</span>
This type of surface outputs intersection depth from brush objects.
<dt>Incremental</dt><dd>A new displace is added cumulatively on tf an existing displace.</dd>
<dt>Max Displace</dt><dd>The maximum level of intersection depthrger values will be clamped to this value.</dd>

<dt>Displace Factor</dt><dd>The multiplier for the intersection depth.
You can use it to adjust final displace strength or use negative values to paint bumps.</dd>
Tip
If the displace output seems too rough it usually helps to add
a Smooth Modifier after Dynamic Paint in the modifier stack.
<h4>Waves</h4>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-waves.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-waves.jpg" style="width: 320px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Waves Surface.</span>
This surface type produces simulated wave motion. Like displace,
wave surface also uses brush intersection depth to define brush strength.
You can use following settings to adjust the motion:
<dt>Open Borders</dt><dd>Allows waves to pass through mesh “edges” ind of reflecting from them.</dd>

<dt>Timescale</dt><dd>Directly adjusts simulation speed without affecting simulation outcome.
Lower values make simulation go slower and otherwise.</dd>
<dt>Speed</dt><dd>Affects how fast waves travel on the surface.
This setting is also corresponds to the size of the simulation.
Half the speed equals surface double as large.</dd>
<dt>Damping</dt><dd>Reduces the wave strength over time. Basically adj how fast wave disappears.</dd>

<dt>Spring</dt><dd>Adjusts the force that pulls water back to “zero le.</dd>
<dt>Smoothness</dt><dd>(Todo)</dd>
Tip
In some cases the wave motion gets very unstable around brush.
It usually helps to reduce wave speed, brush “wave factor” or even the resolution of mesh/surface.
<h4>Weight</h4>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-weight.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_dynamic-paint_canvas_surface-type-weight.jpg" style="width: 320px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Weight Surface.</span>
This is a special surface type only available for vertex format.
It outputs vertex weight groups that can be used by other Blender modifiers and tools.
Tip
It is usually preferred to use “proximity” based brushes for

weight surfaces to allow smooth falloff between weight values.
<h3>Common Options</h3>
For each surface type there are special settings to adjust.
Most types have the settings Dissolve and Brush:
<dt>Dissolve</dt><dd>Used to make the surface smoothly return to its inal state during a defined Time period.</dd>
<dt>Brush Collection</dt><dd>Used to define a specific collectionpick brush objects from.</dd>

<dt>Influence Scale, Radius Scale</dt><dd>For tweaking brush ings individually for each surface.</dd>

(color/weight depending on surface type) to generate results to.
You can use the “+”/”-” icons to add/remove a data layers of given name.

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Scene ‣ Gravity</span></dd>
Gravity is a global setting that is applied to all physics systems in a scene.

It can be found in the scene tab.
This value is generally fine left at its default, -9.810 on the Z axis,
which is the force of gravity in the real world.
Changing this value would simulate a lower or higher force of gravity.
Gravity denoted g, measurement m × s<sup>-2</sup>.
Gravity is applied in the same way to all physics systems.

Gravity is practically the same around the entirety of planet Earth.
For rendering scenes from the Moon, use a value six times smaller, i.e. 1.622 m × s<sup>-2</sup>.
The planet Mars has a gravity value of 3.69.
Note
The gravity value per physics system can be scaled down in the Field Weights tab.

Deflection for soft body objects is difficult, they often penetrate the colliding objects.
Hair particles ignore deflecting objects
(but you can animate them as soft bodies which take deflection into account).
If you change the deflection settings for an object you have to recalculate the particle,
soft body or cloth system by Delete Bake, this is not done automatically.

<h3>Soft Body and Cloth</h3>
It is also important to note that this collision panel is used to tell
all simulations that this object is to participate in colliding/deflecting other objects

on a shared layer (particles, soft bodies, and cloth).
Note
The object's shape deforms the cloth,
so the cloth simulation must be inputted the “true” shape of that mesh object at that frame.
This true shape is the basis shape as modified by shape keys or armatures. Therefore,
the Collision Modifier must be after any of those.

The image to the right shows the Modifiers panel for the Character mesh object
(not the cloth object).
<dt>Damping</dt><dd>Damping during a collision.

Note
Soft body collisions are difficult to get perfect.
If one of the objects move too fast, the soft body will penetrate the mesh.
See also the section about <a href="soft_body/index.html"><span class="blue">Soft Bodies</span></a>.
<h2>Examples</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/physics_collision_defected-particles.png" />

<span class="orange">Deflected particles.</span>
Here is a Meta object, using instancing verts to a particle system emitting downwards,
and deflected by a mesh cube.
<h2>Hints</h2>
Make sure that the normals of the mesh surface are facing towards the particles/points for correct deflection.
Hair particles react directly to force fields,

so if you use a force field with a short range you do not need necessarily collision.
Hair particles avoid their emitting mesh if you edit them in Particle Edit Mode.
So you can at least model the hair with collision.
<h2>Baking Physics Simulations</h2>
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-baking"><span class="xref std std-term">Baking</span></a> refers to the act of storing or caching the results of a calculation.

The result of a simulation is automatically cached to memory when the animation is played,
so that the next time it runs, it can be replayed more quickly by reading the results from the memory.
If you bake the simulation the cache is protected,
and you will be unable to change the simulation settings
until you clear the baked frames by clicking Free Bake.
It is generally recommended to bake your physics simulations before rendering.

Aside from no longer needing to go through the time-consuming process of simulating again,
baking can help prevent potential glitches and ensure that the outcome of the simulation
remains exactly the same every time.
Note
Most physics simulators in Blender use a similar system,
but not all have exactly the same settings available. All the settings are covered here,

but individual physics types may not provide all these options.

<h2>Options</h2>

If the cache does not have a name (which is the default),
the filename of the cache will depend on the object it is attached to,

although this is not immediately obvious. For example, a cache on
an object <code><span class="sapphire">Cube</span></code> will be stored in <code><span class="sapphire">43756265_xxxxxx_yy.bphys</span></code>,
where <code><span class="sapphire">43756265</span></code> is determined by the object name.
Warning
When there are multiple caches on one object, always specify a Cache Name. As described above,
the filename of an unnamed cache is determined by the name of the object it is attached to.

As a result, an object with multiple physics systems that all have an unnamed cache will cause
conflict and can result in losing cache files.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Rendering is the process of turning a 3D scene into a 2D image.
Blender includes three render engines with different strengths:
<a href="eevee/index.html"><span class="blue">Eevee</span></a> is a physically based realtime renderer.
<a href="cycles/index.html"><span class="blue">Cycles</span></a> is a physically based path tracer.

More renderers from third-party developers are available as
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/addons.html"><span class="blue">add-ons</span></a>.
Each renderer has its own render settings to control render quality and performance.
What the render looks like is defined by <a href="cameras.html"><span class="blue">cameras</span></a>,
<a href="lights/index.html"><span class="blue">lights</span></a> and <a href="materials/index.html"><span class="blue">materials</span></a>.
These are shared between Eevee and Cycles, however some features are only supported in one or the other.

Renders can be split up into <a href="layers/index.html"><span class="blue">layers and passes</span></a>, which can then

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Eevee is Blender's realtime render engine built using <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-opengl"><span class="xref std std-term">OpenGL</span></a> focused on
speed and interactivity while achieving the goal of rendering <abbr title="Physically Based Rendering">PBR</abbr> materials.

Eevee can be used interactively in the 3D Viewport but also produce high quality final renders.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_eevee_introduction_viewport.png" />
<span class="orange">Eevee in the 3D Viewport – “Tiger” by Daniel Bystedt.</span>
Eevee materials are created using the same shader nodes as Cycles, making it easy to render existing scenes.
For Cycles users, this makes Eevee work great to preview material in realtime.
Unlike Cycles, Eevee is not a raytrace render engine.

Instead of computing each ray of light, Eevee uses a process called rasterization.
Rasterization estimates the way light interacts with objects and materials using numerous algorithms.
While Eevee is designed to use <abbr title="Physically Based Rendering">PBR</abbr> principles,
it is not perfect and Cycles will always provide more physically accurate renders.
Because Eevee uses rasterization it has a large set of <a href="limitations.html"><span class="blue">limitations</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">World</span></h2>
The world environment can emit light, ranging from a single solid color
to arbitrary textures.

In Eevee, the world lighting contribution is first rendered and
stored in smaller resolution textures before being applied to the objects.
This makes the lighting less precise than Cycles.

Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission shader,
lights are another way to add light into the scene.
The difference is that they are not directly visible in the rendered image,

and can be more easily managed as objects of their own type.
<h2>Common</h2>

Note

The light's Power/Strength affect both specular and diffuse light.
<h2>Shadows</h2>
<h3>Common Parameters</h3>
<dt>Clip Start</dt><dd>Distance from the light object at which the shadow map starts.
Any object before this distance will not appear to cast shadows.
Clip Start will only appear for point, spot and area lights.</dd>

<dt>Bias</dt><dd>Bias applied to the depth test to reduce self swing artifacts.</dd>
<h3>Contact Shadows</h3>
This type of shadow exists to fix light leaking caused by bias or shadow map undersampling.
It uses the depth buffer to find occluders (just like Screen Space Reflections).
However, just like Screen Space Reflections it has the same limitations,
namely, unknown object thickness and effect disappearing at screen edges.

Tip
The distance of action of Contact Shadows should remain quite small.
They are not accurate enough to shadow the entire scene.
<dt>Distance</dt><dd>World space distance in which to search for screpace occluder.</dd>

<dt>Thickness</dt><dd>Pixel thickness used to detect occlusion, trea any potential occluder as this thick.</dd>

<h3>Cascaded Shadow Map</h3>
These special kind of shadow maps are used by Sun lights.
This is because they can shadow large scenes by distributing multiple shadow maps over the frustum range.
Each cascade covers a different portion of the view frustum.
Do note that cascade shadow maps are always updated because they are view dependent.
This means they have a high performance impact.

Note
In orthographic view the cascades cover the whole depth range of the camera
with an evenly distributed shadow precision.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Limitations</span></h2>

Eevee's goal is to be an interactive render engine. Some features may not be there yet or
may be impossible to implement into Eevee's architecture without compromising performance.
Here is a rather exhaustive list of all the limitations you can expect while working with Eevee.
<h2>Cameras</h2>
Only perspective and orthographic projections are currently supported.
<h2>Lights</h2>

Only 128 active lights can be supported by Eevee in a scene.
Only 8 Shadowed sun lights can be supported at the same time.
As of now, lights can only have one color and do not support light node trees.
<h2>Light Probes</h2>
Eevee only supports up to 128 active Reflection Cubemaps.
Eevee only supports up to 64 active Irradiance Volumes.

Eevee only supports up to 16 active Reflection Planes inside the view frustum.
<h2>Indirect Lighting</h2>
Volumetrics don't receive light from Irradiance Volumes but do receive world's diffuse lighting.
Eevee does not support “specular to diffuse” light bounces nor “specular to specular” light bounces.
All specular lighting is turned off during baking.
<h2>Shadows</h2>

Only 128 active lights can be supported by Eevee in a scene.
Only 8 Shadowed sun lights can be supported at the same time.
<h2>Volumetrics</h2>
Only single scattering is supported.
Volumetrics are rendered only for the camera “rays”. They don't appear in reflections/refractions and probes.
Volumetrics don't receive light from Irradiance Volumes but does receive world's diffuse lighting.

Volumetric shadowing does only work on other volumetrics. They won't cast shadows on solid objects in the scene.
Volumetric shadowing does only work for volumes inside the view frustum.
Volumetric lighting does not respect the lights shapes. They are treated as point lights.
<h2>Depth of Field</h2>
Rendered at half resolution which can create blocky pixel artifacts on tiny features that are nearly in focus.
The near and far defocus buffers are in fact one single continuous texture. This can make some bleeding

appear on the left and right size of the image. This can be fixed by using the overscan feature.
<h2>Screen Space Effects</h2>
Eevee is not a ray tracing engine and cannot do ray-triangle intersection.
Instead of this, Eevee uses the depth buffer as an approximated scene representation.
This reduces the complexity of scene scale effects and enables a higher performance.
However, only what is in inside the view can be considered when computing these effects.

Also, since it only uses one layer of depth, only the front-most pixel distance is known.
These limitations creates a few problems:
The screen space effects disappear when reaching the screen border.
This can be partially fixed by using the overscan feature.
Screen space effects lack deep information (or the thickness of objects).
This is why most effects have a thickness parameter to control how to consider potential intersected pixels.

Blended surfaces are not considered by these effects.
They are not part of the depth prepass and do not appear in the depth buffer.
<h3>Ambient Occlusion</h3>
Objects are treated as infinitely thick, producing overshadowing if the Distance is really large.
<h3>Screen Space Reflections</h3>
Only one glossy BSDF can emit screen space reflections.

The evaluated BSDF is currently arbitrarily chosen.
Screen Space Reflections will reflect transparent objects and objects using Screen Space Refraction
but without accurate positioning due to the one layer depth buffer.
<h3>Screen Space Refraction</h3>
Only one refraction event is correctly modeled.
Only opaque and alpha hashed materials can be refracted.

<h3>Subsurface Scattering</h3>
Only one BSSRDF can produce screen space subsurface scattering.
The evaluated BSSRDF is currently arbitrarily chosen.
A maximum of 254 different surfaces can use subsurface scattering.
Only scaling is adjustable per pixel. Individual RGB radii are adjustable in the socket default value.
Input radiance from each surfaces are not isolated during the blurring,

leading to light leaking from surface to surface.
<h2>Materials</h2>
<dt>Refractions</dt><dd>Refraction is faked by sampling the same reflection probe used by the Glossy BSDFs,
but using the refracted view direction instead of the reflected view direction.
Only the first refraction event is modeled correctly.
An approximation of the second refraction event can be used for relatively thin objects using Refraction Depth.

Using Screen Space refraction will refract what is visible inside the view,
and use the nearest probe if there is no hit.
Screen Space Reflections and Ambient Occlusion are not compatible with Screen Space Refraction;
they will be disabled on the surfaces that use it.
Surfaces that use Screen Space Refraction will not appear in Screen Space Reflections at the right place.
Surfaces that use Screen Space Refraction will not cast Ambient Occlusion onto other surfaces.</dd>

<dt>Bump Mapping</dt><dd>As of now, bump mapping is supported using OpenGL derivatives which are the same for each block of 2×2 pixels.
This means the bump output value will appear pixelated.
It is recommended to use normal mapping instead.
Tip
If you absolutely need to render using Bump nodes,
render at twice the target resolution and downscale the final output.

</dd>
<dt>Volume Objects</dt><dd>Object volume shaders will affect the whole bounding box of the object.
The shape of the volume must be adjusted using procedural texturing inside the shader.</dd>
<h2>Shader Nodes</h2>
All BSDF's are using approximations to achieve realtime performance
so there will always be small differences between Cycles and Eevee.

Some utility nodes are not yet compatible with Eevee (e.g. Sky Texture node).
See also
For a full list of unsupported nodes see <a href="materials/nodes_support.html"><span class="blue">Nodes Support</span></a>.
<h2>Memory Management</h2>
In Eevee, <abbr title="Graphic Processing Unit, also known as Graphics Card">GPU</abbr>
Memory management is done by the GPU driver.

In theory, only the needed textures and meshes (now referred as “the resources”) for a single draw call
(i.e. one object) needs to fit into the GPU memory.
So if the scene is really heavy,
the driver will swap things in and out to make sure all objects are rendered correctly.
In practice, using too much GPU memory can make the GPU driver crash, freeze, or kill the application.
So be careful of what you ask.

There is no standard way of estimating if the resources will fit into the GPU memory and/or
if the GPU will render them successfully.
<h2>CPU Rendering</h2>
Being a rasterization engine, Eevee only uses the power of
the <abbr title="Graphic Processing Unit, also known as Graphics Card">GPU</abbr> to render.
There is no plan to support <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> (software) rendering

as it would be very inefficient. CPU power is still needed to handle high scene complexity
as the geometry must be prepared by the CPU before rendering each frame.
<h2>Multiple GPU Support</h2>
There is currently no support for
multiple <abbr title="Graphic Processing Unit, also known as Graphics Card">GPU</abbr> systems.
<h2>Headless Rendering</h2>

There is currently no support for using Eevee on headless systems (i.e. without a Display Manager).

<h2>Light Rays</h2>
Ray types can be divided into four categories:
Camera: the ray comes straight from the camera.
Reflection: the ray is generated by a reflection off a surface.
Transmission: the ray is generated by a transmission through a surface.

Shadow: the ray is used for (transparent) shadows.
Reflection and transmission rays can further have these properties:
Diffuse: the ray is generated by a diffuse reflection or transmission (translucency).
Glossy: the ray is generated by a glossy specular reflection or transmission.
Singular: the ray is generated by a perfectly sharp reflection or transmission.
The Light Path node can be used to find out the type of ray the shading is being computed for.

<h3>Transparency Rays</h3>
The transparent <abbr title="Bidirectional scattering distribution function">BSDF</abbr> shader is given
special treatment. When a ray passes through it, light passes straight on,

as if there was no geometry there.
The ray type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF.
Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF.
Other transmission BSDFs are considered opaque,
because they change the light direction. As such they cannot be used for
alpha-over compositing, while this is possible with the transparent BSDF.

Note that, while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry was hit,
rendering performance is affected as each transparency step requires executing the shader and tracing a ray.

Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a surface is occluded by
nearby surfaces. It simulates soft global illumination shadows by faking darkness

perceived in corners and at mesh intersections, creases, and cracks,
where ambient light is occluded, or blocked.
This is a trick that is not physically accurate,
but it is useful to emphasize the shapes of surfaces,
or as a cheap way to get an effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting.
<dt>Factor</dt><dd>The strength of the ambient occlusion; value 1.0 ike a white world shader.</dd>

<dt>Distance</dt><dd>Distance from shading point to trace rays.
A shorter distance emphasizes nearby features,
while longer distances make it also take objects farther away into account.</dd>
Lighting from ambient occlusion is only applied to diffuse reflection BSDFs;
glossy or transmission BSDFs are not affected.
Transparency of surfaces will be taken into account, i.e.

a half-transparent surface will only half occlude.
An alternative method of using Ambient Occlusion on a per-shader basis is to use
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/input/ao.html"><span class="blue">Ambient Occlusion</span></a> shader.
<h2>Mist Pass</h2>

<span class="orange">Mist example (<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/File:25-Manual-World-Mist-Example1.blend">blend-file</a>).</span>
Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To create mist,
Blender makes objects farther away more transparent (decreasing their Alpha value)
so that they mix more of the background color with the object color. With Mist enabled

the further the object is away from the camera the less its alpha value will be.
Shown when the Mist pass is enabled. Mist values will range from 0.0 - 1.0 and
are available from the Render Layers node.
<dt>Start</dt><dd>The distance from the camera at which the mist ss to fade in.</dd>
<dt>Depth</dt><dd>The distance from Start of the mist, that it fades in over.
Objects further from the camera than Start + Depth are completely hidden by the mist.</dd>

<dt>Falloff</dt><dd>The curve function that controls the rate of change of the mist's strength further and further into the distance.
<dt>Quadratic</dt><dd>Uses the same calculation as light falloff (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\over{x^2}\)</span>) and provides the smoothest
transition from transparent (0.0) to opaque (1.0).</dd>
<dt>Linear</dt><dd>Has a steeper start than quadratic (<span clamath notranslate nohighlight">\(1\over{x}\)</span>).</dd>
<dt>Inverse Quadratic</dt><dd>Has the steepest start (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\over{\sqrt{x}}\)</span>) and approaches 1.0 faster than the other two
functions.</dd></dd>

Tip
A visualization can be activated in the <span class="saddlebrown">Camera ‣ Display</span> panel.
Tip
Because Mist works by adjusting transparency,
this can sometimes cause objects to be partially transparent when they should not be.
One workaround is to set the Mist settings as desired, but turn Mist off.

The Mist data is still available for compositing even though it is off.
Use <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/index.html"><span class="blue">Compositing</span></a> to feed the Mist pass to
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/types/color/alpha_over.html"><span class="blue">Alpha Over</span></a> node to blend the background color
(or a render layer with just the sky) with the rendered image.
This produces the mist effect but since Mist is off the object transparency (or lack of) is preserved.

It is almost always a good idea to enable this when
using an image texture to light the scene, otherwise noise can take a very long time to converge.

<dt>Distance</dt><dd>If you have got a pretty dense volume that is lit from far away
then Distance sampling is usually more efficient.</dd>

<h2>Ray Visibility</h2>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">World ‣ Ray Visibility</span></dd>
As with other objects,
Ray Visibility allows you to control which other shaders can “see” the environment.
<h3>Tricks</h3>

Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is directly visible versus one
that is indirectly lighting the objects. A simple solution to this is to add a Mix node,
with the Blend Factor set to Is Camera Ray. The first input color is then the indirect color,
and the second the directly visible color. This is useful when using a high-res image for
the background and a low-res image for the actual lighting.
Similarly, adding the Is Camera and Is Glossy rays will mean that the high-res image

will also be visible in reflections.

<dt>Multiple Importance Sample</dt><dd>By default objects with emitting materials use both direct and indirect light sampling methods,
but in some cases it may lead to less noise overall to disable direct light sampling for some materials.
This can be done by disabling the Multiple Importance Sample option.
This is especially useful on large objects that emit little light compared to other light sources.
This option will only have an influence if the material contains an Emission node; otherwise it will be disabled.</dd>
<dt>Transparent Shadows</dt><dd>Use transparent shadows if it contains a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/shader/transparent.html"><span class="blue">Transparent BSDF</span></a>,

Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission shader,
lights are another way to add light into the scene.

The difference is that they are not directly visible in the rendered image,
and can be more easily managed as objects of their own type.

<dt>Multiple Importance Sample</dt><dd>By default lights use only direct light sampling. For area lights and sharp glossy reflections, however,

this can be noisy,
and enabling this option will enable indirect light sampling to be used in addition to reduce noise.</dd>
<h2>Light Portals</h2>
Area lights can also function as light portals to help sample the environment light,
and significantly reduce noise in interior scenes.
Note that rendering with portals is usually slower, but as it converges more quickly, less samples are required.

Light portals work by enabling the Portal option, and placing areas lights in
windows, door openings, and any place where light will enter the interior.
In outdoor scenes most rays do not bounce much and just fly off into the sky and therefore,
light portals are not helpful for outdoor scenes.

<h2><span class="greenbut">GPU Rendering</span></h2>
<abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> rendering makes it possible to use your
graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up rendering
because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number crunching.
On the other hand, they also have some limitations in rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory,

and issues with interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and rendering.
To enable GPU rendering, go into the <span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ System ‣ Cycles Render Devices</span>,
and select either CUDA, Optix or OpenCL. Next, you must configure each scene to use GPU rendering in
<span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Render ‣ Device</span>.
<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>
Blender supports two different technologies to render on the GPU depending on the particular GPU manufacture.

<h3>Nvidia</h3>
<abbr title="Compute Unified Device Architecture">CUDA</abbr> and Optix
are supported for GPU rendering with Nvidia graphics cards.
<h4>CUDA</h4>
CUDA requires graphics cards with compute capability 3.0 and higher.
To make sure your GPU is supported,

see the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">list of Nvidia graphics cards</a>
with the compute capabilities and supported graphics cards.
CUDA GPU rendering is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
<h4>Optix</h4>
For RTX graphics cards with hardware ray tracing support (e.g. Turing), Optix can be used for better performance.
Optix support is still experimental and does not yet support all features, see below for details.

Optix requires Geforce or Quadro RTX graphics card with recent Nvidia drivers, and is supported on Windows and Linux.
<h3>AMD</h3>
<abbr title="Open Computing Language">OpenCL</abbr>
is supported for GPU rendering with AMD graphics cards.
Blender supports graphics cards with <abbr title="Graphics Core Next">GCN</abbr> generation 2 and above.
To make sure your GPU is supported,

see the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next#Iterations">list of GCN generations</a>
with the GCN generation and supported graphics cards.
AMD OpenCL GPU rendering is supported on Windows and Linux, but not on macOS.
<h2>Supported Features and Limitations</h2>
CUDA and OpenCL rendering supports all the same features as CPU rendering, except two:
Open Shading Language.

Advanced volume light sampling to reduce noise.
Optix support is experimental and does not yet support the following features:
Baking
Branched Path Tracing
Ambient Occlusion and Bevel shader nodes
Combined CPU + GPU rendering

Using CPU memory for bigger scenes
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Why is Blender unresponsive during rendering?</h3>
While a graphics card is rendering, it cannot redraw the user interface, which makes Blender unresponsive.
We attempt to avoid this problem by giving back control over the GPU as often as possible,
but a completely smooth interaction cannot be guaranteed, especially on heavy scenes.

This is a limitation of graphics cards for which no true solution exists,
though we might be able to improve this somewhat in the future.
If possible, it is best to install more than one GPU,
using one for display and the other(s) for rendering.
<h3>Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?</h3>
There maybe be multiple causes,

but the most common is that there is not enough memory on your graphics card.
Typically while using GPU rendering the GPU can only use the amount of memory that is on the GPU.
This is usually much smaller then the amount of system memory that the CPU uses.
In the case that the GPU runs out of memory Blender will automatically try to also use system and GPU memory.
This has a performance impact but it is still faster than using CPU rendering.
This feature does not work on OpenCL rendering.

<h3>Can multiple GPUs be used for rendering?</h3>
Yes, go to <span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ System ‣ Compute Device Panel</span>, and configure it as you desire.
<h3>Would multiple GPUs increase available memory?</h3>
No, each GPU can only access its own memory.
<h3>What renders faster, Nvidia or AMD, CUDA or OpenCL?</h3>
Currently Nvidia with CUDA is rendering fastest, but this really depends on the hardware you buy.

Currently, CUDA and OpenCL are about the same in the newest mid-range GPUs.
However, CUDA is fastest in the respect of high-end GPUs.
<h2>Error Messages</h2>
In case of problems, be sure to install the official graphics drivers from the Nvidia or AMD website,
or through the package manager on Linux.
<h3>Unsupported GNU version! gcc 4.7 and up are not supported!</h3>

On Linux, depending on your GCC version you might get this error. There are two possible solutions:
<dt>Use an alternate compiler</dt><dd>If you have an older GCC installed that is compatible with the installed CUDA toolkit version,
then you can use it instead of the default compiler.
This is done by setting the <code><span class="sapphire">CYCLES_CUDA_EXTRA_CFLAGS</span></code> environment variable when starting Blender.
Launch Blender from the command line as follows:
<span></span><span class="nv">CYCLES_CUDA_EXTRA_CFLAGS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;-ccbin gcc-x.x&quot;</span> blender

</pre>
(Substitute the name or path of the compatible GCC compiler).</dd>
<dt>Remove compatibility checks</dt><dd>If the above is unsuccessful, delete the following line in
<code><span class="sapphire">/usr/local/cuda/include/host_config.h</span></code>
<span></span><span class="c1">#error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc 4.7 and up are not supported!</span>
</pre>

</dd>
This will allow Cycles to successfully compile the CUDA rendering kernel the first time it
attempts to use your GPU for rendering. Once the kernel is built successfully, you can
launch Blender as you normally would and the CUDA kernel will still be used for rendering.
<h3>CUDA Error: Invalid kernel image</h3>
If you get this error on Windows 64-bit, be sure to use the 64-bit build of Blender,

not the 32-bit version.
<h3>CUDA Error: Kernel compilation failed</h3>
This error may happen if you have a new Nvidia graphics card that is not yet supported by
the Blender version and CUDA toolkit you have installed.
In this case Blender may try to dynamically build a kernel for your graphics card and fail.
In this case you can:

Check if the latest Blender version
(official or <a class="reference external" href="https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/">experimental builds</a>)
supports your graphics card.
If you build Blender yourself, try to download and install a newer CUDA developer toolkit.
Normally users do not need to install the CUDA toolkit as Blender comes with precompiled kernels.
<h3>CUDA Error: Out of memory</h3>

This usually means there is not enough memory to store the scene on the GPU.
We can currently only render scenes that fit in graphics card memory,
and this is usually smaller than that of the CPU. See above for more details.
Note
One way to reduce memory usage is by using smaller resolutions for textures.
For example, 8k, 4k, 2k, and 1k image textures take up respectively 256MB, 64MB, 16MB and 4MB of memory.

<h3>The Nvidia OpenGL driver lost connection with the display driver</h3>
If a GPU is used for both display and rendering,
Windows has a limit on the time the GPU can do render computations.
If you have a particularly heavy scene, Cycles can take up too much GPU time.
Reducing Tile Size in the Performance panel may alleviate the issue,
but the only real solution is to use separate graphics cards for display and rendering.

Another solution can be to increase the time-out,
although this will make the user interface less responsive when rendering heavy scenes.
<a class="reference external" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Learn More Here</a>.
<h3>CUDA error: Unknown error in cuCtxSynchronize()</h3>
An unknown error can have many causes, but one possibility is that it is a time-out.
See the above answer for solutions.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Experimental Features</span></h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Render</span></dd>
Experimental features are disabled / hidden by default,
but can be enabled by setting Feature Set to Experimental in the Render properties.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Render Baking</span></h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Render ‣ Bake</span></dd>
Cycles shaders and lighting can be baked to image textures.
This has a few different purposes, most commonly:
Baking textures like base color or normal maps for export to game engines.
Baking ambient occlusion or procedural textures,
as a base for texture painting or further edits.

Creating light maps to provide global illumination or speed up rendering in games.
<h2>Setup</h2>
Baking requires a mesh to have a UV map, and an Image Texture node with an image to be baked to.
The active (last selected) Image Texture node is used as the baking target.
Use Render Bake in intensive light/shadow solutions,
such as AO or soft shadows from area lights. If you bake AO for the main objects,

you will not have to enable it for the full render, saving render time.
Cycles uses the render settings (samples, bounces, …) for baking.
This way the quality of the baked textures should match the result you get from the rendered scene.
<h2>Settings</h2>
<h3>Bake Types</h3>
<dt>Combined</dt><dd>Bakes all materials, textures, and lighting except specularity.

The passes that contribute to the combined pass can be toggled individually to form the final map.</dd>
<dt>Ambient Occlusion</dt><dd>Bakes ambient occlusion as specifie the World panels. Ignores all lights in the scene.</dd>
<dt>Shadow</dt><dd>Bakes shadows and lighting.</dd>
<dt>Normals</dt><dd>Bakes normals to an RGB image.
<dt>Normal Space</dt><dd>Normals can be baked in different spaces:
<dt>Object space</dt><dd>Normals in object coordinates, independent oject transformation, but dependent on deformation.</dd>

<dt>Tangent space</dt><dd>Normals in tangent space coordinates, independent of object transformation and deformation.
This is the default, and the right choice in most cases, since then the normal map can be used for animated
objects too.</dd></dd>
<dt>Normal Swizzle</dt><dd>Axis to bake into the red, green and blue cel.</dd>
For materials the same spaces can be chosen in the image texture options
next to the existing Normal Map setting. For correct results,

the setting here should match the setting used for baking.</dd>
<dt>UV</dt><dd>Mapped UV coordinates, used to represent where on a mesh a texture gets mapped too.
This is represented through the red and green channels of the image,
the blue channel is encoded with a constant value of 1 but does not hold any information.</dd>
<dt>Emit</dt><dd>Bakes Emission, or the Glow color of a material.</dd>
<dt>Environment</dt><dd>Bakes the environment (i.e. the world surface shader defined for the scene) onto

the selected object(s) as seen by rays cast from the world origin.</dd>
<dt>Diffuse, Glossy, Transmission, Subsurface</dt><dd>Bakes the diffuse, glossiness, transmission of subsurface pass of a material.
If only color is selected you get the pass color,
which is a property of the surface and independent of sampling refinement.
If color is not selected, you get the direct and/or indirect contributions in gray-scale.
If color and either direct or indirect are selected, you get the direct and/or indirect contributions colored.

</dd>
<h3>Selected to Active</h3>
<dt>Select to Active</dt><dd>Bake shading on the surface of selected objects to the active object.
The rays are cast from the low-poly object inwards towards the high-poly object.
If the high-poly object is not entirely involved by the low-poly object, you can tweak the rays start point with
Ray Distance or Cage Extrusion (depending on whether or not you are using cage).

For even more control you can use a Cage Object.</dd>
Note
Memory Usage
There is a CPU fixed memory footprint for every object used to bake from.
In order to avoid crashes due to lack of memory, the high-poly objects can be joined before the baking process.
The render tiles parameter also influence the memory usage, so the bigger the tile the less overhead you have,

but the more memory it will take during baking (either in GPU or CPU).
<dt>Cage</dt><dd>Cast rays to active object from a cage.
A cage is a ballooned-out version of the low-poly mesh created either automatically
(by adjusting the ray distance) or manually (by specifying an object to use).
When not using a cage the rays will conform to the mesh normals. This produces glitches on the edges,
but it is a preferable method when baking into planes to avoid the need of adding extra loops around the edges.</dd>

<dt>Ray Distance</dt><dd>Distance to use for the inward ray cast when using selected to active.
Ray distance is only available when not using Cage.</dd>
<dt>Cage Extrusion</dt><dd>Distance to use for the inward ray cast when using Selected to Active and Cage.
The inward rays are casted from a version of the active object with disabled Edge Split Modifiers.
Hard splits (e.g. when the Edge Split Modifier is applied) should be avoided because they will lead to non-smooth
normals around the edges.</dd>

<dt>Cage</dt><dd>Object to use as cage instead of calculating the cage from the active object with the Cage Extrusion.
Note
When the base mesh extruded does not give good results,
you can create a copy of the base mesh and modify it to use as a Cage.
Both meshes need to have the same <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-topology"><span class="xref std std-term">topology</span></a> (number of faces and face order).
</dd>

<h3>Output</h3>
<dt>Margin</dt><dd>Baked result is extended this many pixels beyond thrder of each UV “island”, to soften seams in the texture.</dd>
<dt>Clear</dt><dd>If selected, clears the image before baking render.</dd>

The Workbench Engine is a render engine optimized for fast rendering during modeling and animation preview.
It is not intended to be a render engine that will render final images for a project.
Its primary task is to display a scene in the 3D Viewport when it is being worked on.

Note
While its not intended to be used for final renders,
the Workbench render engine can be selected as the Render Engine in the Render properties.
By default the 3D Viewport uses Workbench to shade and light objects.
Shading settings can be tweaked in the 3D Viewport's <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/controls/shading.html"><span class="blue">Shading popover</span></a>.
Workbench supports assigning random colors to objects to make each visually distinct.

Other coloring mechanisms also exist, including; materials, vertex colors, and textures.
Workbench also has an X-ray mode to see through objects,
along with cavity and shadow shading to help display details in objects.
Workbench supports several lighting mechanisms including studio lighting and MatCaps.
The image below is an excellent example of the Workbench engine's capabilities
using random coloring and shadows to show the details of the model.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Viewport Display</span></h2>
The Workbench engine does not work with shader trees. In various tabs of the Properties editor
are Viewport Display panel where settings can be adjusted that the Workbench engine uses.
<h2>Object</h2>
The Viewport Display panel in the Object Properties has several settings that
are used by the Workbench Engine.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Sampling</span></h2>
The quality of the renders can be adjusted by changing the anti-aliasing method.

A different one can be selected for the 3D Viewport, Viewport rendering and
for final rendering.
The setting for the 3D Viewport is a user preference to specify the anti-aliasing method
that runs best on the used system. The setting for viewport rendering
and final rendering is saved per scene.

Tip
Multisample anti-aliasing is well suited for rendering small details like hair.
Progressive Viewport Rendering

For the 3D Viewport, one sample is rendered at a time. When there are no changes
to the scene or viewport the next sample will be rendered.</dd>
<h2><span class="greenbut">Cameras</span></h2>
A camera is an object that provides a means of rendering images from Blender.
It defines which portion of a scene is visible in the rendered image.
Cameras are invisible in renders, so they do not have any material or texture settings.

However, they do have Object and Editing setting panels available
which are displayed when a camera is the selected (active!) object.

<h3>Lens</h3>

Type
The camera lens options control the way 3D objects are represented in a 2D image.
<dt>Perspective</dt><dd>This matches how you view things in the real world.
Objects in the distance will appear smaller than objects in the foreground,
and parallel lines (such as the rails on a railroad) will appear to converge as they get farther away.

the amount of the scene which is visible all at once.
Longer focal lengths result in a smaller <abbr title="Field of View">FOV</abbr> (more zoom),
while short focal lengths allow you to see more of the scene at once
(larger <abbr title="Field of View">FOV</abbr>, less zoom).

</dd>

Hint
While the camera is moving towards an object the Focal Length property can be decreased
to produce a Dolly Zoom camera effect, or vice versa.

<dt>Orthographic</dt><dd>With Orthographic perspective objects always appear at their actual size, regardless of distance.

This means that parallel lines appear parallel, and do not converge like they do with Perspective.

<dt>Orthographic Scale</dt><dd>This controls the apparent size of objects projected on the image.
Note that this is effectively the only setting which applies to orthographic perspective.
Since parallel lines do not converge in orthographic mode (no vanishing points),

the lens shift settings are equivalent to translating the camera in the 3D View.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_cameras_orthographic.svg"><img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_cameras_orthographic.svg" width="50%" /></a>

Notice how the horizontal lines remain perfectly horizontal when using the lens shift,

<dt>Clip Start and End</dt><dd>The interval in which objects are directly visible,
Any objects outside this range still influence the image indirectly,
as further light bounces are not clipped.
Note
For viewport rendering, setting clipping distances to limited values

is important to ensure sufficient rasterization precision.
Ray tracing renders do not suffer from this issue so much,
and as such more extreme values can safely be set.
Tip
When Limits in the Display panel is enabled,
the clip bounds will be visible as two yellow connected dots on the camera line of sight.

<h3>Depth of Field</h3>
Real-world cameras transmit light through a lens that bends and focuses it onto the sensor.
Because of this, objects that are a certain distance away are in focus,

but objects in front and behind that are blurred.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_cameras_dof-bokeh.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_cameras_dof-bokeh.jpg" style="width: 50%;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Example of DOF bokeh effect.</span>
The area in focus is called the focal point and can be set using either an exact value,
or by using the distance between the camera and a chosen object:
<dt>Focus Object</dt><dd>Choose an object which will determine the focal point. Linking an object will deactivate the distance parameter.

Typically this is used to give precise control over the position of the focal point,
and also allows it to be animated or constrained to another object.</dd>
<dt>Focal Distance</dt><dd>Sets the distance to the focal point when no Focus Object is specified.
If Limits are enabled, a yellow cross is shown on the camera line of sight at this distance.
Hint
Hover the mouse over the Distance property and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">E</kbd> to use a special Depth Picker.

Then click on a point in the 3D View to sample the distance from that point to the camera.

<dt>Rotation</dt><dd>Rotate the polygonal blades along the facing axis, and will rotate in a clockwise,
and counter-clockwise fashion.</dd>
<dt>Ratio</dt><dd>Change the amount of distortion to simulate the anamorphic bokeh effect.

<dt>Sensor Fit</dt><dd>Option to control which dimension (verl or horizontal) along which field of view angle fits.</dd>
<h3>Safe Areas</h3>
Safe areas are guides used to position elements to ensure that
the most important parts of the content can be seen across all screens.
Different screens have varying amounts of <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-overscan"><span class="xref std std-term">overscan</span></a> (especially older TV sets).
That means that not all content will be visible to all viewers,

since parts of the image surrounding the edges are not shown.
To work around this problem TV producers defined two areas where content is guaranteed to be shown:
action safe and title safe.
Modern LCD/plasma screens with purely digital signals have no <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-overscan"><span class="xref std std-term">overscan</span></a>,
yet safe areas are still considered best practice and may be legally required for broadcast.
In Blender, safe areas can be set from the Camera and Sequencer views.

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_cameras_safe-areas-main-BI.png"><img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_cameras_safe-areas-main-BI.png" style="width: 50%;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Red line: Action safe. Green line: Title safe.</span>
The Safe Areas can be customized by their outer margin,
which is a percentage scale of the area between the center and the render size.
Values are shared between the Video Sequence editor and camera view.
<dt>Title Safe Margins X/Y</dt><dd>Also known as Graphics Safe.

Place all important information (graphics or text) inside this area to
ensure it can be seen by the majority of viewers.</dd>
<dt>Action Safe Margins X/Y</dt><dd>Make sure any significant action or characters in the shot are inside this area.
This zone also doubles as a sort of “margin” for the screen which can be used
to keep elements from piling up against the edges.</dd>
Tip

Each country sets a legal standard for broadcasting.
These include, among other things, specific values for safe areas.
Blender defaults for safe areas follow the EBU (European Union) standard.
Make sure you are using the correct values when working for broadcast to avoid any trouble.
<h4>Center-Cut Safe Areas</h4>
Center-cuts are a second set of safe areas to ensure content

is seen correctly on screens with a different aspect ratio.
Old TV sets receiving <code><span class="sapphire">16:9</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">21:9</span></code> video will cut off the sides.
Position content inside the center-cut areas to make sure the most important elements
of your composition can still be visible in these screens.
Blender defaults show a <code><span class="sapphire">4:3</span></code> (square) ratio inside <code><span class="sapphire">16:9</span></code> (widescreen).

<h3>Background Images</h3>
A background picture in your camera can be very helpful in many situations:
modeling is obviously one, but it is also useful when painting
(e.g. you can have reference pictures of faces when painting textures directly on your model…),
or animation (when using a video as background), etc.

<dt>Crop</dt><dd>Scales the image up so that it fills the entire camera view,
but without altering the aspect ratio (some of the image will be cropped).</dd></dd>
<dt>Offset X/Y</dt><dd>Positions the background image using these offsets.
In orthographic views, this is measured in the normal scene units.

In the camera view, this is measured relative to the camera bounds
(0.1 will offset it by 10% of the view width/height).</dd>
<dt>Rotation</dt><dd>Rotates the image around its center.</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt><dd>Scales the image up or down from its center.</dd>
<dt>Flip Horizontally</dt><dd>Swaps the image around, such that the lside is now on the right, and the right now on the left.</dd>

<span class="orange">Point light.</span>
The Point light is an omni-directional point of light,
that is, a point radiating the same amount of light in all directions.
It's visualized by a plain, circled dot.

Being a point light source, the direction of the light hitting an object's surface
is determined by the line joining the light and the point on the surface of the object itself.
It can be used as simple model of e.g. a light bulb.
Light intensity/energy decays based on (among other variables)
distance from the Point light to the object. In other words,
surfaces that are further away will be rendered darker.

<dt>Blend</dt><dd>The Blend slider controls the inner cone of the Spot.
The Blend value can be between (0.0 to 1.0).
The value is proportional and represents that amount of space that the inner cone should
occupy inside the outer cone Size.
The inner cone boundary line indicates the point at which light from the Spot will start to blur/soften;
before this point its light will mostly be full strength.

The larger the value of Blend the more blurred/soft the edges of the spotlight will be,
and the smaller the inner cone's circular area will be (as it starts to blur/soften earlier).
To make the Spot have a sharper falloff rate and therefore less blurred/soft edges,
decrease the value of Blend.
Setting Blend to 0.0 results in very sharp spotlight edges, without any transition between light and shadow.
The falloff rate of the Spot light is a ratio between the Blend and Size values;

the larger the circular gap between the two, the more gradual the light fades between Blend and Size.
Blend and Size only control the Spot light cone's aperture and softness (“radial” falloff);
they do not control the shadow's softness as shown below.

<h2>Area Light</h2>
The Area light simulates light originating from a surface (or surface-like) emitter.
For example, a TV screen, office neon lights, a window,

or a cloudy sky are just a few types of area light. The area light produces shadows with
soft borders by sampling a light along a grid the size of which is defined by the user.
This is in direct contrast to point-like artificial lights which produce sharp borders.

Tip
Choosing the appropriate shape for your Area light will enhance the believability of your scene.

For example, you may have an indoor scene and would like to simulate light entering through a window.
You could place a Rectangular area light in a window (vertical) or from neons (horizontal)
with proper ratio for Size X and Size Y. For the simulation of the light emitted by
a TV screen, a vertical Square area light would be better in most cases.

<h2>Sun Light</h2>
A sun light provides light of constant intensity emitted in a single direction from infinitely far away.
A sun light can be very handy for a uniform clear daylight open-space illumination. In the 3D View,
the Sun light is represented by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from it,
plus a dashed line indicating the direction of the light.
Note

This direction can be changed by rotating the Sun light, like any other object,
but because the light is emitted from a location considered infinitely far away,
the location of a Sun light does not affect the rendered result.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_lights_world_environment-lighting.jpg" />
<span class="orange">Lighting with an HDR image.</span>
The world defines the environment that the scene is in.
The surface shader sets the background and environment lighting,

either as a fixed color, sky model or HDRI texture.
With volume shaders the entire scene can be covered in mist or other volumetric effects.
<h2>Surface</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">World ‣ Surface</span></dd>

The surface shader defines the light emission from the environment into the scene.
The world surface is rendered as if it is very distant from the scene,
and as such there is no two-way interacting between objects in the scene and the environment,
only light coming in. The only shader accepted is the Background node with a color input and
strength factor for the intensity of the light.
<h3>Image Based Lighting</h3>

For image based lighting,
use the Environment Texture node rather than the Image Texture node for correct mapping.
This supports Equirectangular (also known as latitude/longitude) for environment maps,
and Mirror Ball mapping for converting photos of mirror balls to environment maps.
<h2>Volume</h2>
Reference

<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">World ‣ Volume</span></dd>
A volume shader can be applied to the entirely world, filling the entire space.
Currently this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes,
as the world surface shader or sun lights will have no effect if a volume shader is used.
This is because the world background is assumed to be infinitely far away,

which is accurate enough for the sun for example.
However, for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering,
it is not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space,
as most of the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space.
For such effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene.
The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or absorbed.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Materials control the appearance of meshes, curves, volumes and other objects.

They define the substance that the object is made of, its color and texture,
and how light interacts with it.
Physically based materials can be created using
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html"><span class="blue">Principled BSDF</span></a>,
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/shader/hair_principled.html"><span class="blue">Principled Hair</span></a>,
and <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/shader/volume_principled.html"><span class="blue">Principled Volume</span></a> shaders.

With these uber shaders, a wide variety of materials including
plastic, glass, metal, cloth, skin, hair, smoke and fire can be created.
A flexible <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/introduction.html"><span class="blue">shading nodes</span></a> system is used
to set up textures and create entirely different types of materials like toon shading.
<h2>Setting up Materials</h2>
Materials can be created in either the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/properties_editor.html"><span class="blue">Material properties</span></a>,

or in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/shader_editor.html"><span class="blue">Shader Editor</span></a>.
These provide a different view of the same shader nodes and material settings.
The defaults Shading workspace has a Shader Editor and a 3D Viewport that can be set to
Material Preview or Rendered shading, to interactively preview how the material interacts
with objects and lights in the scene.
Materials are data-blocks that can be <a href="assignment.html"><span class="blue">assigned</span></a>

to one or more objects, and different materials can be assigned to different parts of meshes.
Image textures can be created from scratch in <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/sculpt_paint/texture_paint/index.html"><span class="blue">Texture Paint Mode</span></a>,
or by loading in existing images with the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/textures/image.html"><span class="blue">Image Texture node</span></a>.
A variety of <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/textures/index.html"><span class="blue">procedural texture nodes</span></a> is also available.
<h2>Components</h2>
Materials consist of three shaders, defining the appearance of the surface,

the volume inside the object, and the displacement of the surface.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_materials_introduction_shaders.svg" />
<h3>Surface Shader</h3>
The <a href="components/surface.html"><span class="blue">surface shader</span></a> controls the textures
and light interaction at the surface of the mesh.
<h3>Volume Shader</h3>

The <a href="components/volume.html"><span class="blue">volume shader</span></a> defines the interior of the mesh.
A material can have just a volume shader for cases like smoke and fire,
or it can be combined with a surface shader for materials like cloudy glass.
<h3>Displacement</h3>
The shape of the surface and the volume inside it may be altered by
<a href="components/displacement.html"><span class="blue">displacement</span></a>.

This way, textures can then be used to make the mesh surface more detailed.
Depending on the settings, the displacement may be virtual,
only modifying the surface normals to give the impression of displacement,
which is known as bump mapping, or a combination of real and virtual displacement.
<h2>Physically Based Shading</h2>
The material system is built with physically-based rendering in mind,

separating how a material looks and which rendering algorithm is used to render it.
This makes it easier to achieve realistic results and balanced lighting,
though there are a few things to keep in mind.
In order for materials to work well with global illumination, they should be energy conserving.
That means they cannot reflect more light than comes in.
This property is not strictly enforced, but if colors are in the range 0.0 to 1.0, and

<abbr title="Bidirectional scattering distribution function">BSDF</abbr>s are only mixed together with
the Mix Shader node, this will automatically be true.
It is however, possible to break this,
with color values higher than 1.0 or using the Add Shader node, but one must be careful when
doing this to keep materials behaving predictably under various lighting conditions.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Assignment</span></h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Material ‣ Material Slots</span></dd>
Materials are data-blocks that can be created and then assigned to one or more objects.
An object can also have multiple materials assigned in different material slots,

which correspond to different parts of an object. If a smooth transition between
materials is desired, then mixing shader nodes with a <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/shader/mix.html"><span class="blue">Mix shader</span></a>
is a better solution.
<h2>Material Slots</h2>
Material slots link materials to objects and meshes.
By default objects only have a single material slot, which assigns a material to the entire object.

If different parts of the mesh need different materials, multiple material slots can be created.

Here new materials can be created, or existing materials can to the material slot.</dd>
<dt>Data-block Links</dt><dd>Specifies whether the material is to be linked to the Object or to the Object Data.
The Link selector has two choices, Data and Object.
These two menu choices determine whether the material is linked to the object or to the data
(e.g. a mesh or curve). The Data menu item determines that this material will be linked to the mesh's
data-block which is linked to the object's data-block.

The Object menu item determines that the material will be linked to the object's data-block directly.
This has consequences of course. For example, different objects may share the same mesh data-block.
Since this data-block defines the shape of the object any change in Edit Mode
will be reflected on all of those objects.
Moreover, anything linked to that mesh data-block will be shared by every object that shares that mesh.
So, if the material is linked to the mesh, every object will share it.

On the other hand, if the material is linked directly to the object data-block, the objects can have
different materials and still share the same mesh.
Short explanation: If connected to the object, you can have several instances of the same Object Data using
different materials. If linked to mesh data, you cannot.

<h3>Edit Mode</h3>

To assign materials to different parts of a mesh, enter Edit Mode on the mesh.
Additional buttons will then appear in the material slots panel.

<h2>Reusing Existing Materials</h2>
Blender is built to allow you to reuse anything, including material settings,
between many objects. Instead of creating duplicate materials,
you can simply reuse an existing material.

There are several ways to do this using the Material's data-block menu:
Single Object – With the object selected, click the sphere located to the left of the Material name.
A pop-up appears showing all the materials available in the current blend-file.
To use one, just click on it.
Tip
Searching for Materials

The search field at the bottom of the material list allows you to search the names in the list.
For example, by entering “wood” all existent materials are filtered so that
only materials containing “wood” are displayed in the list.
Multiple Objects – In the 3D View, with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-L</kbd>
you can quickly link all selected objects to the material (and other aspects)
of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/selecting.html#object-active"><span class="std std-ref">active object</span></a>.

Very useful if you need to set a large number of objects to the same material;
just select all of them,
then the object that has the desired material, and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-L</kbd> links them to that “parent”.
(See Tip on Linking Data in Creating about data linking.)
<h2>Deleting a Material</h2>
To delete a material, select the material and click X in the Available Materials List entry.

Although the material will seem to disappear immediately,
the Delete action can depend on how the material is used elsewhere.
If the material is linked to the object and there are other objects which use this material,
then the material will be removed from that object (but remain on all its other objects).
If the “Fake User” button has been lit in the Available Materials list,
then the material will be retained when the file is saved, even if it has no users.

Only if it has 0 “real” users, and no “Fake” user, will the material be permanently deleted.
Note that it will still remain in the Materials list until the blend-file is saved,
but will have disappeared when the file is reloaded.
<h2>Multiple Materials</h2>
Normally, different colors or patterns on an object are achieved by adding textures to your materials.
However, in some applications you can obtain multiple colors on an object by assigning

different materials to the individual faces of the object.
To apply several materials to different faces of the same object,
you use the Material Slots options in the Materials header panel.
The workflow for applying a second material to some faces of an object covered by
a base material is as follows:
In Object Mode, apply the base material to the whole object.

Create/select the second material (the whole object will change to this new material).
In the Active Material list, reselect the base material.
Go into Edit Mode and Face Select (a new list appears above
the Active Material list with Assign/Select/Deselect buttons).
Select the face/faces to be colored with the second material.
In the Object Material Slots list, click the <code><span class="sapphire">+</span></code> button to create a new slot, and while this is still active,

click on the second material in the Available Materials list.
Click the Assign button, and the second material will appear on the selected object faces.
You can also make this new material a copy of an existing material by adding the data-block:
Select the object, get the material, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> and Copy data to clipboard.
When you have renamed the material, click “Link: Data” to link to the existing material.
Proceed to assign faces as required.

N.b: If you change the material on the original object, the new object color changes too.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>

Materials, lights and backgrounds are all defined using a network of shading nodes.
These nodes output values, vectors, colors and shaders.
<h2>Shaders</h2>
An important concept to understand when building node setups is
that of the shader socket. The output of all surface and
volume shaders is a shader, describing lighting interaction at the surface or of the volume,

rather than the color of the surface.
There are a few types of shaders available as nodes:
<dt><abbr title="Bidirectional scattering distribution function">BSDF</abbr> shader</dt><dd>Describe light reflection, refraction and absorptit an object surface.</dd>
<dt>Emission shader</dt><dd>Describe light emission at an object surfar in a volume.</dd>
<dt>Volume shader</dt><dd>Describe light scattering inside a volume.</dd>
<dt>Background shader</dt><dd>Describe light emission from the environ.</dd>

Each shader node has a color input, and outputs a shader.
These can then be mixed and added together using Mix and Add Shader nodes.
No other operations are permitted.
The resulting output can then be used by the renderer to compute all light interactions,
for direct lighting or global illumination.

<h2>Textures</h2>
Blender has various built in procedural texture nodes,
with texture coordinates and various parameters as input, and a color or value as output.
No texture data-blocks are needed; instead node groups can be used for reusing texture setups.
For UV mapping and texture painting in the 3D Viewport, the Image Texture node must be used.

When setting such a node as active, it will be displayed in the 3D Viewport
while using <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/workbench/color.html"><span class="blue">Texture color</span></a> mode.
This method can us to for seeing painted textures while texture painting.
The default texture coordinates for all nodes are Generated coordinates,
with the exception of Image textures that use UV coordinates by default.
Each node includes some options to modify the texture mapping and resulting color,

and these can be edited in the texture properties.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Node Groups</span></h2>

<span class="orange">Example of a node group.</span>
Grouping nodes can simplify a node tree by allowing instancing and hiding parts of the tree.
Both material and composite nodes can be grouped.
Conceptually, grouping nodes allows you to specify a set of nodes that you can treat as

though it were “just one node”. Node groups are similar to functions in programming.
You can then reuse them inside, which are then called “NodeGroups”,
or in other blend-file(s), when appending called “NodeTrees”.
As an example: If you have created a material that you would like to use with different inputs
e.g. diffuse color: red plastic, green plastic. You could create different materials with Make Single User
for each different color with a copy of the tree part describing the plastic material.

If you like to edit the material you would need to redo the edit on all materials.
A better method of reuse is to create node groups, exposing only the variable inputs (e.g. diffuse color).
Also nested node groups are supported. I.e. a node group can be inserted or created inside another node group.
Note
Recursive node groups are prohibited for all the current node systems to prevent infinite recursion.
A node group can never contain itself (or another group that contains it).

To create a node group, select the nodes you want to include, then
press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-G</kbd>, <span class="saddlebrown">Group ‣ Make Group</span>.
A node group will have a green title bar. All of the selected nodes will now be contained within the node group.
Default naming for the node group is “NodeGroup”, “NodeGroup.001” etc.

There is a name field in the node group you can click into to change the name of the group.
Change the name of the node group to something meaningful.
When appending node groups from one blend-file to another,
Blender does not make a distinction between material node groups or composite node groups,
so it is recommended to use some naming convention that will allow you to easily distinguish between the two types.
Tip

What not to include in node groups:
Remember that the essential idea is that a group should be an easily-reusable,
self-contained software component. Material node groups should not include:
<dt>Input nodes</dt><dd>If you include a source node in your group,
you will end up having the source node appearing twice: once inside the group,
and once outside the group in the new material node tree.</dd>

<dt>Output node</dt><dd>If you include an output node in the group, thwill not be an output socket available from the group!</dd>

With a node group selected, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> expands the node to a frame, and the individual nodes within

it are shown. You can move them around, play with their individual controls, re-thread them internally, etc.
just like you can if they were a normal part of the editor view. You will not be able, though,
to thread them to a node outside the group; you have to use the external sockets on the side of the node group.
While <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> can be used to both enter and exit a group, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Tab</kbd> only exits.

<h3>Interface</h3>
<h4>Interactively</h4>
When a node group is created, new Group Input and Group Output nodes are generated
to represent the data flow into and out of the group. When created, connections to input sockets coming
from unselected nodes will become attached to new sockets on the Group Input node.
Similarly, outgoing connections to input sockets of unselected nodes will become attached to

the new Group Output node.
If during node group development an additional parameter needs to be passed into the group,
an additional socket must be added to the Group Input node.
This is easily done by adding a connection from the hollow socket on the right side of the Group Input node
to the desired input socket on the node requiring input.
The process is similar for the Group Output regarding data

you want to be made available outside the group.

If you have multiple inputs or outputs, they can be re-ordered by selecting the socket in the list

The larger plus sign buttons below the list will add an unconnected socket of the same type
as the selected socket or a value socket if there is no selection.
The triangle at the bottom of the list has filtering functions to facilitate finding nodes
if the group has a large number of sockets.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Open Shading Language</span></h2>
<span class="guilabel">Cycles Only</span>
It is also possible to create your own nodes using
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage">Open Shading Language</a> (OSL).
Note that these nodes will only work for CPU rendering;
there is no support for running OSL code on the GPU.

To enable it, select Open Shading Language as the shading system in the render settings.
Note
On Linux, C/C++ compiler tools (in particular <code><span class="sapphire">/usr/bin/cpp</span></code>)
must be installed to compile OSL scripts.
<h2>Script Node</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_shader-nodes_osl_script-node.png" />

<span class="orange">Script Node.</span>
OSL was designed for node-based shading,
and each OSL shader corresponds to one node in a node setup.
To add an OSL shader, add a script node and link it to a text data-block or an external file.
Input and output sockets will be created from the shader parameters on
clicking the update button in the Node or the Text editor.

OSL shaders can be linked to the node in a few different ways. With the Internal mode,
a text data-block is used to store the OSL shader, and the OSO bytecode is stored in the node itself.
This is useful for distributing a blend-file with everything packed into it.
The External mode can be used to specify a <code><span class="sapphire">.osl</span></code> file from a drive,
and this will then be automatically compiled into a <code><span class="sapphire">.oso</span></code> file in the same directory.
It is also possible to specify a path to a <code><span class="sapphire">.oso</span></code> file, which will then be used directly,

with compilation done manually by the user. The third option is to specify just the module name,
which will be looked up in the shader search path.
The shader search path is located in the same place as the scripts or configuration path, under:
<dt>Linux</dt><dd>$HOME/.config/blender/2.82/shaders/</pre></dd>
<dt>Windows</dt><dd>C:\Users\$user\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.82\shaders\</pre></dd>
<dt>macOS</dt><dd>/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/2.82/shaders/</pre></dd>

Tip
For use in production, we suggest to use a node group to wrap shader script nodes,
and link that into other blend-files.
This makes it easier to make changes to the node afterwards as sockets are added or removed,
without having to update the script nodes in all files.
<h2>Writing Shaders</h2>

For more details on how to write shaders, see the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage/blob/master/src/doc/osl-languagespec.pdf">OSL specification</a>.
Here is a simple example:

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>

<h2>Closures</h2>
OSL is different from, for example, RSL or GLSL, in that it does not have a light loop.
There is no access to lights in the scene,
and the material must be built from closures that are implemented in the renderer itself.
This is more limited, but also makes it possible for the renderer to do optimizations and
ensure all shaders can be importance sampled.

The available closures in Cycles correspond to the shader nodes and their sockets;
for more details on what they do and the meaning of the parameters,
see the <a href="shader/index.html"><span class="blue">shader nodes manual</span></a>.

<h2>Trace</h2>

We support the <code><span class="sapphire">trace(point</span> <span class="sapphire">pos,</span> <span class="sapphire">vector</span> <span class="sapphire">dir,</span> <span class="sapphire">...)</span></code>
function, to trace rays from the OSL shader.
The “shade” parameter is not supported currently,
but attributes can be retrieved from the object that was hit using the <code><span class="sapphire">getmessage(&quot;trace&quot;,</span> <span class="sapphire">..)</span></code> function.
See the OSL specification for details on how to use this.
This function cannot be used instead of lighting;

the main purpose is to allow shaders to “probe” nearby geometry,
for example to apply a projected texture that can be blocked by geometry,
apply more “wear” to exposed geometry, or make other ambient occlusion-like effects.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Color Management</span></h2>
Color management is important to create renders and assets that are physically accurate and look great
on multiple display devices. It is used both to ensure all parts of the pipeline interpret colors correctly,

and to make artistic changes like exposure and color grading.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_color-management_different-exposures.jpg"><img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_color-management_different-exposures.jpg" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<span class="orange">Different views and exposures of the same render.</span>
Blender's color management is based on the <a class="reference external" href="http://opencolorio.org/">OpenColorIO</a> library.
By using the same OpenColorIO configuration in multiple applications,
the same color spaces and transforms will be available for consistent results.

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<h3>Scene Linear Color Space</h3>
For correct results, different <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-color-space"><span class="xref std std-term">color spaces</span></a>
are needed for rendering, display and storage of images.
Rendering and compositing is best done in scene linear color space,
which corresponds more closely to nature, and makes computations more physically accurate.

<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_color-management_linear-workflow.svg" /><span class="orange">An example of a linear workflow.</span>
If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality, we double the number of photons,
the color values are also doubled. Put another way,
if we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those images together,
the result would be the same as a render/photo with both lights on. It follows that such
a radiometrically linear space is best for photorealistic rendering and compositing.

However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or the way display devices
work. and image files are often stored in different color spaces.
So we have to take care to do the right conversion into and out of this scene linear color space.
<h3>Display Transforms</h3>
Transforming scene linear colors to display involves both technical and artistic choices.
Correct display of renders requires a conversion to the display device color space.

A computer monitor works differently from a digital cinema projector or HDTV,
and so needs a different conversion.
There is also an artistic choice to be made.
Partially that is because display devices cannot display the full spectrum of colors and
only have limited brightness, so we can squeeze the colors to fit in the gamut of the device.
Besides that, it can also be useful to give the renders a particular look,

e.g. as if they have been printed on real camera film.
The default Filmic transform does this.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_color-management_linear-display-space.svg" /><span class="orange">Conversion from linear to display device space.</span>
<h3>Image Color Spaces</h3>
When loading and saving media formats it is important to have color management in mind.
File formats such as PNG or JPEG will typically store colors in a color space ready for

display, not in a linear space. When they are used as textures in renders,
they need to be converted to linear first, and when saving renders for display on the web,
they also need to be converted to a display space.
For intermediate files in production, it is recommended to use OpenEXR files.
These are always stored in scene linear color spaces, without any data loss.
That makes them suitable to store renders that can later be composited, color graded and

converted to different output formats.
Images can also contain data that is not actually a color. For example normal or displacement maps
merely contain vectors and offsets. Such images should be marked as Non-Color Data so
that no color space conversion happens on them.

<span class="orange">Render settings for color management.</span>
<h3>Display</h3>
<dt>Display Device</dt><dd>The device that the image is being viewed on.

Most computer monitors are configured for the sRGB color space,
and so when working on a computer usually this option should just be left to the default.
It would typically be changed when viewing the image on another display device connected to the computer,
or when writing out image files intended to be displayed on another device.
Rec709 is commonly used for HDTVs, while XYZ and DCI-P3 are common for digital projectors.
Color management can be disabled by setting the device to None.</dd>

<h3>Render</h3>
<dt>View</dt><dd>These are different ways to view the image on the same display device.
<dt>Standard</dt><dd>Does no extra conversion besides the conversion for the display device. Often used for
non-photorealistic results or video editing where a specific look is already baked into
the input video.</dd>
<dt>Filmic</dt><dd>For photorealistic results and better handling of high dynamic range colors.

The contrast can be adjusted by changing the Look option for the Filmic view transform.</dd>
<dt>Filmic Log</dt><dd>Converts to Filmic log color space. This can be used for export to color grading applications,
or to inspect the image by flattening out very dark and light areas.</dd>
<dt>Raw</dt><dd>Intended for inspecting the image but not for final export.
Raw gives the image without any color space conversion.</dd>
<dt>False Color</dt><dd>Shows a heat map of image intensities, to vlize the dynamic range.</dd></dd>

<dt>Exposure</dt><dd>Used to control the image brightness (in stops) applied before color space conversion.
It is calculated as follows: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(output\_value = render\_value × 2^{(exposure)}\)</span></dd>
<dt>Gamma</dt><dd>Extra gamma correction applied after color space conversion.
Note that the default display transforms already perform the appropriate conversion,
so this mainly acts as an additional effect for artistic tweaks.</dd>
<dt>Look</dt><dd>Choose an artistic effect from a set of measured film response data

which roughly emulates the look of certain film types. Applied before color space conversion.</dd>
<dt>Use Curves</dt><dd>Adjust RGB Curves to control image colors before color space conversion.
Read more about using the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/curve.html#ui-curve-widget"><span class="std std-ref">Curve Widget</span></a>.</dd>
<h3>Sequencer</h3>
<dt>Color Space</dt><dd>The color space that the Sequencer operates in. By default, the Sequencer operates in sRGB space,
but it can also be set to work in Linear space like the Compositing nodes, or another color space.

Different color spaces will give different results for color correction, crossfades, and other operations.</dd>
<h2>Image Files</h2>
When working with image files, the default color space is usually the right one.
If this is not the case, the color space of the image file can be configured in the image settings.
A common situation where manual changes are needed is when working with or baking normal maps or displacement maps,
for example. Such maps do not actually store colors, just data encoded as colors.

Those images should be marked as Non-Color Data.
Image data-blocks will always store float buffers in memory in the scene linear color space,
while a byte buffer in memory and files in a drive are stored in the color space specified with this setting:
<dt>Color Space</dt><dd>The color space of the image file on a drive. This depends on the file format,
for example, PNG or JPEG images are often stored in sRGB, while OpenEXR images are stored in a linear color space.
Some images such as normal, bump or stencil maps do not strictly contain ‘colors',

and on such values, no color space conversion should ever be applied.
For such images, the color space should be set to None.</dd>
By default only renders are displayed and saved with the render view transformations applied.
These are the Render Result and Viewer image data-blocks,
and the files saved directly to a drive with the Render Animation operator.
However, when loading a render saved to an intermediate OpenEXR file,

Blender cannot detect automatically that this is a render
(it could be e.g. an image texture or displacement map).
We need to specify that this is a render and that we want the transformations applied,
with these two settings:
<dt>View as Render</dt><dd>Display the image data-block (not only renders) with view transform, exposure, gamma, RGB curves applied.
Useful for viewing rendered frames in linear OpenEXR files the same as when rendering them directly.</dd>

<dt>Save as Render</dt><dd>Option in the image save operator to apply the view transform, exposure, gamma, RGB curves.
This is useful for saving linear OpenEXR to e.g. PNG or JPEG files in display space.</dd>
<h2>OpenColorIO Configuration</h2>
Blender comes with a standard OpenColorIO configuration that
contains a number of useful display devices and view transforms.
The reference linear <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-color-space"><span class="xref std std-term">color space</span></a> used is the linear color space

with Rec. 709 chromaticities and D65 white point.
However, OpenColorIO was also designed to give a consistent user experience across
<a class="reference external" href="http://opencolorio.org/CompatibleSoftware.html">multiple applications</a>,
and for this, a single shared configuration file can be used.
Blender will use the standard OCIO environment variable to read an OpenColorIO configuration
other than the default Blender one. More information about how to set up such a workflow

can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="http://opencolorio.org/">OpenColorIO website</a>.
Blender currently use the following color space rules:
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">scene_linear</span></code></dt><dd>Color space used for rendering, compositing, andring all float precision images in memory.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">data</span></code></dt><dd>Color space for non-color data.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">XYZ</span></code></dt><dd>Standard linear XYZ color space. Used for effects such as blackbody emission to convert
from physical units to the scene_linear color space.</dd>

<dt><code><span class="sapphire">color_picking</span></code></dt><dd>Defines the distribution of colors in color pickers. It is expected to
be approximately perceptually linear, have the same gamut as the scene_linear color space,
map 0..1 values to 0..1 values in the scene linear color space for predictable editing of material albedos.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">default_sequencer</span></code></dt><dd>Default color space for the Secer, scene_linear if not specified.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">default_byte</span></code></dt><dd>Default color space for byte precision images andes, texture_paint if not specified.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">default_float</span></code></dt><dd>Default color space for float precision im and files, scene_linear if not specified.</dd>

The standard Blender configuration includes support for saving and loading images in
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces">ACES</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev">code and documentation</a>) color spaces.
However, the ACES gamut is larger than the Rec. 709 gamut,
so for best results, an ACES specific configuration file should be used.
OpenColorIO provides an <a class="reference external" href="http://opencolorio.org/configurations/index.html">ACES configuration</a> file,

though it may need a few more tweaks to be usable in production.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Freestyle is an edge/line-based non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering engine.
It relies on mesh data and Z-depth information to draw lines on selected edge types.
Various line styles can be added to produce artistic (“hand drawn”, “painted”, etc.)
or technical (hard line) looks.
The two operating modes: <a href="python.html"><span class="blue">Python Scripting</span></a> and

<a href="parameter_editor/index.html"><span class="blue">Parameter Editor</span></a> –
allow a powerful diversity of line styles and results. Line styles such as Japanese big brush, cartoon, blueprint,
thickness-with-depth are already pre-scripted in Python. The Parameter Editor mode allows intuitive editing of
features such as dotted lines and easy setup of multiple line types and edge definitions.
On top of all of that, with line style modifiers, the sky is the limit!

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
Activate Freestyle by the <span class="saddlebrown">Properties ‣ Render ‣ Freestyle</span> checkbox.
Freestyle settings are located in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/view_layers/index.html"><span class="blue">View Layer</span></a> properties.
One view layer can only have one view map. A view map holds the edge detection settings
(Crease Angle, Culling toggle, Face Smoothness toggle, Material Boundaries toggle,

Sphere Radius, and Kr Derivative Epsilon advanced options).
A view map can have multiple Line Sets.
A line set controls which line types and selections will be rendered, from lines based on your scene.
Each line set uses one line style (which can be shared between multiple Line Sets).
A line style tells Freestyle how to render the linked Line Sets in terms of color, alpha,
thickness and other aspects.

<dt>View Map Cache</dt><dd>An option to reuse a previously computed view map for subsequent rendering.
The cache is automatically updated when the mesh geometry of the input 3D scene has been changed.
This functionality offers a major performance boost for Freestyle animation rendering
when the camera-space mesh geometry is static, as well as for repeated still renders

with updates of line stylization options.
Although the ‘'View map cache' checkbox is a view layer option,
the cache memory is shared by all view layers and scenes.
This means that if Freestyle is used for two or more view layers

id="bpy-types-scenerenderlayer"></span><h2>View Layers</h2>

Renders can be separated into layers, to composite them back together afterwards.
Some example usages are applying compositing effects to characters separately,
blurring the background and foreground layers separately for depth of field,
or rendering different lighting variations of the same scene.
Using View Layers can also save you from having to re-render your entire image each time you change something,
allowing you to instead re-render only the layer(s) that you need.

<h2>View Layers</h2>

Additional options shown in this panel are different for each render engine.
See <a href="passes.html"><span class="blue">Render Passes</span></a> for the options per render

engine.
<h2>Usage</h2>
Each Render Layer has an associated set of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/collections/collections.html"><span class="blue">Collections</span></a>.
Objects which are on one of the associated collections are shown in that Render Layer,
as long as that collection is also visible.
Warning

Only the objects in visible Scene Layers will be rendered.
So, if only Collection 1 is visible and your Render Layer set specifies to render only Collections 2 and 3,
nothing will be rendered.
<h2>Collections</h2>
Per collection you can adjust the way how the render engine needs to render the objects inside.
Based on the render engine different options can be set.

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Scene ‣ View Layers ‣ Passes</span></dd>
Passes can be used to split rendered images into colors, direct and indirect light to edit them individually,
and also to extract data such as depth or normals.
<h3>Lighting Passes</h3>
<dt>Combined</dt><dd>The final combination of render passes with evhing included.</dd>
<dt>Noisy Image</dt><dd>If denoising is enabled, the original combipass before denoising.</dd>

<dt>Diffuse Direct</dt><dd>Direct lighting from diffuse BSDFs. We define direct lighting as coming from lights, emitting surfaces,
the background, or ambient occlusion after a single reflection or transmission off a surface.
BSDF color is not included in this pass.</dd>
<dt>Diffuse Indirect</dt><dd>Indirect lighting from diffuse BSDFs. We define indirect lighting as coming from lights,
emitting surfaces or the background after more than one reflection or transmission off a surface.
BSDF color is not included in this pass.</dd>

<dt>Diffuse Color</dt><dd>Color weights of diffuse BSDFs. These weights are the color input socket for BSDF nodes,
modified by any Mix and Add Shader nodes.</dd>
<dt>Glossy Direct, Indirect, Color</dt><dd>Same as above, but for glosSDFs.</dd>
<dt>Transmission Direct, Indirect, Color</dt><dd>Same as above, for transmission BSDFs.</dd>

<dt>Emission</dt><dd>Emission from directly visible surfaces.</dd>

<dt>Environment</dt><dd>Emission from the directly visible background. When the film is set to transparent,
this can be used to get the environment color and composite it back in.</dd>
<dt>Shadow</dt><dd>Shadows from light objects. Mostly useful for comting objects with shadow into existing footage.</dd>
<dt>Ambient Occlusion</dt><dd>Ambient occlusion from directly visible surfaces. BSDF color or AO factor is not included; i.e.
it gives a ‘normalized' value between 0 and 1.</dd>
Note

<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/cycles/render_settings/light_paths.html"><span class="blue">Transparent BSDFs are given special treatment</span></a>.
A fully transparent surface is treated as if there is no surface there at all;
a partially transparent surface is treated as if only part of the light rays can pass through.
This means it is not included in the Transmission passes;
for that a glass BSDF with index of refraction 1.0 can be used.
<h4>Combining</h4>

All these lighting passes can be combined to produce the final image as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/render_layers_passes_combine.svg" />
<h3>Data Passes</h3>
<dt>Z</dt><dd>Distance to any visible surfaces.
Note
The Z pass only uses one sample.

When depth values need to be blended in case of motion blur or <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-depth-of-field"><span class="xref std std-term">Depth of Field</span></a>, use the mist pass.
</dd>
<dt>Mist</dt><dd>Distance to visible surfaces, mapped to the 0.0-1.0 range.
When enabled, settings are in <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/cycles/world_settings.html#render-cycles-integrator-world-mist"><span class="std std-ref">World tab</span></a>.
This pass can be used in compositing to fade out objects that are farther away.</dd>
<dt>Normal</dt><dd>Surface normal used for shading.</dd>

<dt>Vector</dt><dd>Motion vectors for the Vector Blur node. The four components consist of 2D vectors
giving the motion towards the next and previous frame position in pixel space.</dd>
<dt>UV</dt><dd>Mapped UV coordinates, used to represent where on a mesh a texture gets mapped too.
This is represented through the red and green channels of the image,
the blue channel is encoded with a constant value of 1 but does not hold any information.</dd>
<dt>Object Index</dt><dd>Creates a mask of the object that can be later read by

the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/types/converter/id_mask.html"><span class="blue">ID Mask Node</span></a> in the Compositor.</dd>
<dt>Material Index</dt><dd>Creates a mask of the material that can be later read by
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/types/converter/id_mask.html"><span class="blue">ID Mask Node</span></a> in the Compositor.</dd>
<dt>Denoising Data</dt><dd>Passes needed by the denoiser, for performing animation denoising in a second pass
after rendering the entire animation. For still image denoising as part of
the render process these are not needed.</dd>

Note
The Z, Object Index and Material Index passes are not anti-aliased.
<dt>Alpha Threshold</dt><dd>Z, Index, normal, UV and vector passes are
only affected by surfaces with alpha transparency equal to or higher than this threshold.
With value 0.0 the first surface hit will always write to these passes, regardless of transparency.
With higher values surfaces that are mostly transparent can be skipped until an opaque surface is encountered.</dd>

<h3>Cryptomatte</h3>
Cryptomatte is a standard to efficiently create mattes for compositing.
Cycles outputs the required render passes, which can then be used in the Blender Compositor
or another compositor with Cryptomatte support to create masks for specified objects.
Unlike the Material and Object Index passes, the objects to isolate are selected in compositing,
and mattes will be anti-aliased and take into account effects like motion blur and transparency.

<dt>Object</dt><dd>Render cryptomatte object pass, for isolating obs in compositing.</dd>
<dt>Material</dt><dd>Render cryptomatte material pass, for isolating mials in compositing.</dd>
<dt>Asset</dt><dd>Render cryptomatte asset pass, for isolating groups of objects with the same
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/properties/relations/parents.html"><span class="blue">parent</span></a> in compositing.</dd>
<dt>Levels</dt><dd>Sets how many unique objects can be distinguished pixel.</dd>
<dt>Accurate Mode</dt><dd>Generate a more accurate Cryptomatte pass. Cnly, may render slower and use more memory.</dd>

<h4>Typical Workflow</h4>
Enable Cryptomatte Object render pass in the Passes panel, and render.
In the compositing nodes, create a Cryptomatte node and
link the Render Layer matching Image and Cryptomatte passes to it.
Attach a Viewer node to the Pick output of the Cryptomatte node.
Use the Cryptomatte Add/Remove button to sample objects in the Pick Viewer node.

Use the Matte output of the Cryptomatte node to get the alpha mask.

<h3>Shader AOV</h3>
Shader AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) provide custom render passes for arbitrary shader node components.
As an artist this can be a good way to debug or tweak very fine details of a scene in post processing.

To use Shader AOVs create the pass in the Shader AOV panel then reference this pass with
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/shader_nodes/output/aov.html"><span class="blue">AOV Output</span></a> shading node.
Shader AOVs can be added or removed in the Shader AOV panel.
In this panel is a list of all AOV passes; each AOV in the list consists of a Name and Data Type.
<dt>Name</dt><dd>The name of the render pass; this is the Name that is referenced in the AOV Output node.
Arbitrary names can be used for these passes,

as long as they do not conflict with built-in passes that are enabled.</dd>
<dt>Data Type</dt><dd>Shader AOVs can either express a Color or a Value variable.
The Color variable as the name suggest can be used for a color but also a normal value.
A Value variable can be used for any single numerical value.</dd>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Denoising</span></h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Render Layers ‣ Denoising</span></dd>
Denoising filters the resulting image using information (known as feature passes)
gathered during rendering to get rid of noise, while preserving visual detail as well as possible.
Note
The denoising panel is only available for the Cycles render engine.
To use the option, enable it in the render layers tab of the Properties editor.

On rendering, it will denoise tile by tile once all the surrounding tiles are finished rendering.
The default settings fit a wide range of scenes, but the user can tweak individual settings
to control the trade-off between a noise-free image, image details, and calculation time.

<dt>Optix AI Denoising</dt><dd>Uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to remove noise from renders.
It is based on the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/cycles/gpu_rendering.html#render-cycles-gpu-optix"><span class="std std-ref">Optix</span></a> acceleration engine
and therefore has the same GPU requirements as rendering with Optix.

Optix AI Denoising can be enabled when one or more compatible Optix GPUs
are selected in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/system.html#editors-preferences-cycles"><span class="std std-ref">System Preferences</span></a>.
This denoiser is less suited for animations, because it is not temporarily stable,
but is considerably faster than the other denoising options and
therefore especially useful to denoise previews or final single-frame images with high quality.
<dt>Input Passes</dt><dd>Controls which <a href="passes.html#render-cycles-passes"><span class="std std-ref">passes</span></a> the OptiX AI denoiser should use as input,

which can have different effects on the denoised image.
Generally, the more passes the denoiser has to denoise the better the result.
It is recommended to at least use Color + Albedo as just Color can blur out details,
especially at lower sample counts.</dd></dd>
<dt>Radius</dt><dd>Size of the image area that is used to denoise a pixel.
Higher values are smoother, but might lose detail and are slower.

Setting the radius too high is generally not advisable. It increases denoising time a lot and,
while the result might be smoother, it is not more accurate since there isn't any additional info
coming out of the renderer. Beyond a radius of around 15, the additional rendering time is probably better
spent on increasing the amount of samples.</dd>
<dt>Strength</dt><dd>Controls how different the area around a neighbor pixel can look compared
to the center pixel before it's no longer used for denoising.

Lower values preserve more detail, but aren't as smooth.</dd>
<dt>Feature Strength</dt><dd>Controls removal of noisy and redundant image feature passes before the actual denoising.
This is required in some cases like <abbr title="Depth of Field">DoF</abbr> or motion blur to avoid splotchy results,
but might cause fine texture/geometrical detail to be lost.
Lower values preserve more detail, but aren't as smooth.</dd>
<dt>Relative Filter</dt><dd>When removing features that don't carry information,

decide which to keep based on the total amount of information in the features.
This can help to reduce artifacts, but might cause detail loss around edges.</dd>
<dt>Passes</dt><dd>You can choose to selectively choose which
<a href="passes.html"><span class="blue">Render Passes</span></a> you want to denoise.</dd>
<h2>Notes and Issues</h2>
The denoiser will change in the future and some features are not implemented yet.

If denoising fails to produce good results, more samples or clamping will often resolve the issue.
Denoising cannot be used for baking yet.
For animation denoising can be used, however it still requires high sample counts for good results.
With low sample counts, low frequency (blurry) noise can be visible in animation frames,
even if it is not immediately apparent in still images.
When using GPU rendering, the denoising (non Optix) process may use a significant amount of vRAM.

If the GPU runs out of memory but renders fine without denoising, try reducing the tile size.

<h2>Dithering</h2>
Dithering is a technique for blurring pixels to prevent banding that is seen in areas of
gradients, where stair-stepping appears between colors.
Banding artifacts are more noticeable when gradients are longer, or less steep.
Dithering was developed for graphics with low bit depths,
meaning they had a limited range of possible colors.

Dithering works by taking pixel values and comparing them with a threshold and
neighboring pixels then does calculations to generate the appropriate color.
Dithering creates the perceived effect of a larger color palette by creating a sort of visual color mixing.
For example, if you take a grid and distribute red and yellow pixels evenly across it,
the image would appear to be orange.
The Dither value ranges from 0 to 2.

<h2>Image Output</h2>
When rendering a single frame, the output should be a single image format and not a video.
Several <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/files/media/image_formats.html"><span class="blue">image formats</span></a> are available, PNG being the default.

Images can also be used for rendering animations which has a couple advantages.
For example, when rendering animations to image file formats the render job can be canceled
and resumed at the last rendered frame by changing the frame range.
This is useful if the animation takes a long time to render
and the computers resources are needed for something else.
Images can then be encoded to a video by adding the rendered image sequence into

the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/sequencer/index.html"><span class="blue">Video Sequencer</span></a> and choosing an appropriate <a href="#video-output">Video Output</a>.

Note
Standards
Some containers and codecs are not compatible with each other,
so if you are getting errors check that your container and codec are compatible.
Like containers and codecs are sometimes not compatible with each other, some codecs

do not work with arbitrary dimensions. So, try to stick with common dimensions
or research the limitations of the codec you are trying to use.

<h4>Tips</h4>
Tip
The choice of video format depends on what you are planning to do.
It's not recommended to render directly to a video format in the first instance.
If a problem occurs while rendering, the file might become unplayable and you will
have to re-render all frames from the beginning. If you first render out a set

of static images such as the default PNG format or the higher-quality OpenEXR
(which can retain HDR pixel data), you can combine them as
an <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/sequencer/strips/movie_image.html"><span class="blue">Image Strip</span></a>
in the Video Sequence Editor (VSE). This way, you can easily:
Restart the rendering from the place (the frame) where any problem occurred.
Try out different video encoding options in seconds,

rather than minutes or hours as encoding is usually much faster than rendering the 3D scene.
Enjoy the rest of the features of the VSE, such as adding
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/sequencer/strips/movie_image.html"><span class="blue">Image Strips</span></a>
from previous renders, audio, video clips, etc.
Tip
You shouldn't post-process a lossy-compressed file as the compression artifacts may become visible.

Lossy compression should be reserved as a final ‘delivery format'.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Rendering Animations</span></h2>
While rendering stills will allow you to view and save the image from the render buffer when
it is complete, animations are a series of images, or frames,

and are automatically saved directly out to a drive after being rendered.
After rendering the frames, you may need to edit the clips,
or first use the Compositor to do green-screen masking, matting, color correction, DOF,
and so on to the images. That result is then fed to the Sequencer where the strips are cut and
mixed and a final overlay is done.
Finally you can render out from the Sequencer and compress the frames into a playable movie clip.

<h2>Workflow</h2>
Generally, you do a lot of intermediate renders of different frames in your animation to check
for timing, lighting, placement, materials, and so on. At some point,
you are ready to make a final render of the complete animation for publication.
There are two approaches you can use when making a movie, or animation, with or without sound.
The approach you should use depends on the amount of CPU time you will need to render the movie.

You can render a “typical” frame at the desired resolution,
and then multiply by the number of frames that will ultimately go into the movie, to arrive at a total render time.
If the total render time is an hour or more, you want to use the “Frame Sequence” approach.
For example, if you are rendering a one-minute video clip for film, there will be
(60 seconds per minute) X (24 frames per second) or 1440 frames per minute.
If each frame takes 30 seconds to render,

then you will be able to render two frames per minute, or need 720 minutes (12 hours)
of render time.
Rendering takes all available CPU time; you should render overnight,
when the computer is not needed, or set Blender to a low priority while rendering,
and work on other things (be careful with the RAM space!).
Direct Approach

The Direct Approach, which is highly not recommended and not a standard practice,
is where you set your output format to an AVI or MOV format,
and click Animation to render your scene directly out to a movie file.
Blender creates one file that holds all the frames of your animation. You can then use
Blender's VSE to add an audio track to the animation and render out to an MPEG format to
complete your movie.

Frame Sequence
The Frame Sequence is a much more stable approach,
where you set your output format to a still format (such as JPG, PNG or a multi-layer format),
and click Animation to render your scene out to a set of images,
where each image is a frame in the sequence.
Blender creates a file for each frame of the animation.

You can then use Blender's Compositor to perform any frame manipulation (post-processing).
You can then use Blender's VSE to load that final image sequence,
add an audio track to the animation, and render out to an MPEG format to complete your movie.
The Frame Sequence approach is a little more complicated and takes more drive space,
but gives you more flexibility.
Here are some guidelines to help you choose an approach.

Direct Approach
Short segments with total render time &lt; 1 hour.
Stable power supply.
Computer not needed for other uses.
Frame Sequence Approach
Total render time &gt; 1 hour.

Post-production work needed:
- Color/lighting adjustment
- Green screen/matte replacement
- Layering/compositing
- Multiple formats and sizes of ultimate product
Intermediate frames/adjustments needed for compression/codec.

Precise timing (e.g. lip-sync to audio track) needed in parts.
May need to interrupt rendering to use the computer, and want to be able to resume rendering where you left off.
<h2>Frame Sequence Workflow</h2>
First prepare your animation.
In the Dimensions panel, choose the render size, Pixel Aspect Ratio, and the Range of Frames to use,
as well as the frame rate, which should already be set.

In the Output panel set up your animation to be rendered out as images,
generally using a format that does not compromise any quality.
Choose the output path and file type in the Output panel as well, for example <code><span class="sapphire">//render/my-anim-</span></code>.
Confirm the range of your animation (frame Start and End).
Save your blend-file.
Press the big Animation button.

Do a long task (like sleeping, playing a video game, or cleaning your driveway)
while you wait for your computer to finish rendering the frames.
Once the animation is finished,
use your OS file explorer to navigate into the output folder (<code><span class="sapphire">render</span></code> in this example).
You will see lots of images (<code><span class="sapphire">.png</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">.exr</span></code>, etc. depending on the format you chose to render)
that have a sequence number attached to them ranging from 0000 to a max of 9999. These are your single frames.

In Blender, now go into the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/index.html"><span class="blue">Video Sequence editor</span></a>.
Warning
The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/index.html"><span class="blue">VSE</span></a> does not support multi-layer EXR files.
To render to a video format you will have to skip the next three steps and
instead use an <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/types/input/image.html"><span class="blue">Image Input node</span></a>
in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/types/input/image.html"><span class="blue">Compositor</span></a>.

Choose Add Image from the add menu. Select all the frames from your output folder that you want to include
in your animation (press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd> to Select All easily). They will be added as a strip to the Sequence editor.
Now you can edit the strip and add effects or simply leave it like it is.
You can add other strips, like an audio strip.
Scrub through the animation, checking that you have included all the frames.
In the Output panel, choose the container and codec you want (e.g. <code><span class="sapphire">MPEG</span> <span class="sapphire">H.264</span></code>) and configure them.

The video codecs are described on the previous page: <a href="settings.html"><span class="blue">Output Options</span></a>.
Click the Animation render button and Blender will render out the Sequence editor output into your movie.
Why go through all this hassle? Well, first of all, if you render out single frames, you can
stop the render at any time by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> in the render window or Image editor.
You will not lose the frames you have already rendered,
since they have been written out to individual files.

You can always adjust the range you want to continue from where you left off.
You can edit the frames afterwards and post-process them.
You can add neat effects in the Sequence editor.
You can render the same sequence into different resolutions (640×480, 320×240, etc.)
and use different codecs (to get different file sizes and quality)
with almost no effort whatsoever.

<h2>Hints</h2>
<dt>Your computer accidentally turns off in the middle of rendering your movie!</dt><dd>Unless your animation renders in a few minutes,
it is best to render the animation as separate image files.
Instead of rendering directly to a compressed movie file, use a lossless format (e.g. <code><span class="sapphire">PNG</span></code>).
This allows you an easy recovery if there is a problem and you have to re-start the rendering,
since the frames you have already rendered will still be in the output directory.

Just disable the Overwrite option to start rendering where you left off.
You can then make a movie out of the separate frames with Blender's Sequence editor
or use 3rd party encoding software.</dd>
<dt>Animation Preview</dt><dd>It can be useful to render a subset of the animated sequence,
since only part of an animation may have an error.
Using an image format for output,

you can use the Frame Step option to render every N'th frame.
Then disable Overwrite and re-render with Frame Step set to 1.</dd>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Compositing Nodes allow you to assemble and enhance an image (or movie). Using composition nodes,
you can glue two pieces of footage together and colorize the whole sequence all at once.
You can enhance the colors of a single image or an entire movie clip in a static manner or
in a dynamic way that changes over time (as the clip progresses). In this way,

you use composition nodes to both assemble video clips together and enhance them.
Note
Term: Image
The term Image may refer to a single picture, a picture in
a numbered sequence of images, or a frame of a movie clip.
The Compositor processes one image at a time, no matter what kind of input you provide.

To process your image, you use nodes to import the image into Blender, change it,
optionally merge it with other images, and finally, save it.

<span class="orange">An example of color correction.</span>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Access the Compositor and activate nodes for compositing by clicking the Use Nodes checkbox
(see <a href="properties.html"><span class="blue">Properties</span></a>).
Note
After clicking Use Nodes the Compositor is enabled, however,
it can also be disabled in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/output/settings.html#render-output-postprocess"><span class="std std-ref">Post Processing Panel</span></a>.

You now have your first node setup, from here you can add and connect many types of
<a href="index.html"><span class="blue">Compositing Nodes</span></a>, in a sort of map layout,
to your heart's content (or physical memory constraints, whichever comes first).
Note
Nodes and node concepts are explained in more detail
in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/nodes/index.html"><span class="blue">Nodes</span></a> reference.

<h2>Examples</h2>
You can do just about anything with images using nodes.
Raw footage from a foreground actor in front of a blue screen,
or a rendered object doing something, can be layered on top of a background.
Composite both together, and you have composited footage.
You can change the mood of an image:

To make an image ‘feel' colder, a blue tinge is added.
To convey a flashback or memory, the image may be softened.
To convey hatred and frustration, add a red tinge or enhance the red.
A startling event may be sharpened and contrast-enhanced.
A happy feeling – you guessed it – add yellow (equal parts red and green, no blue) for bright and sunny.
Dust and airborne dirt are often added as a cloud texture over the image to give a little more realism.

<h2>Image Size</h2>
It is recommended to pay attention to image resolution and color depth when mixing and
matching images. Aliasing (rough edges), color flatness,
or distorted images can all be traced to mixing inappropriate resolutions and color depths.
The Compositor can mix images with any size,
and will only perform operations on pixels where images have an overlap.

When nodes receive inputs with differently sized Images, these rules apply:
The first/top Image input socket defines the output size.
The composite is centered by default,
unless a translation has been assigned to a buffer using a Translate node.
So each node in a composite can operate on different sized images as defined by its inputs.
Only the Composite output node has a fixed size,

as defined by the settings in Properties Editor <span class="saddlebrown">Render ‣ Dimensions</span>.
The Viewer node always shows the size from its input, but when not linked
(or linked to a value) it shows a small 320×256 pixel image.
<h2>Saving your Composite Image</h2>
The Render button renders a single frame or image.
Save your image using <span class="saddlebrown">Image ‣ Save Image</span> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-S</kbd>.

The image will be saved using the image format settings on the Render panel.
To save a sequence of images, for example,
if you input a movie clip or used a Time node with each frame in its own file,
use the Animation button and its settings. If you might want to later overlay them,
be sure to use an image format that supports an Alpha channel (such as <code><span class="sapphire">PNG</span></code>).
If you might want to later arrange them front to back or create a depth of field effect,

use a format that supports a Z-depth channel (such as <code><span class="sapphire">EXR</span></code>).
To save a composition as a movie clip (all frames in a single file),
use an <code><span class="sapphire">AVI</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">Quicktime</span></code> format, and use the Animation button and its settings.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Input Nodes</span></h2>

Input nodes produce information from some source.
For instance, an input could be:
taken directly from the active camera in a selected scene,
from a <code><span class="sapphire">JPG</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">PNG</span></code>, etc. file as a static picture,
a movie clip (such as an image sequence or video),
or just a color or value.

These nodes generate the information that feeds other nodes.
As such, they have no input-connectors; only outputs.

These nodes give you the essential tools for creating a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../glossary/index.html#term-matte"><span class="xref std std-term">Matte</span></a> for images
that do not already have their own <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../glossary/index.html#term-alpha-channel"><span class="xref std std-term">Alpha Channel</span></a>.
One usage scenario is blue-screen or green-screen footage,
where live action is shot in front of a blue or green backdrop for replacement by

a matte painting or virtual background.
In general, hook up these nodes to a viewer, set your Image Editor to show the Viewer node,
and play with the sliders in real-time using a sample image from the footage,
to get the settings right. In some cases,
small adjustments can eliminate artifacts or foreground image degradation.
Taking out too much green can result in foreground actors looking flat or blueish/purplish.

You can and should chain these nodes together,
improving your masking and color correction in successive refinements,
using each node's strengths to operate on the previous node's output.
<a href="keying.html"><span class="blue">Keying Node</span></a> is the closest to a “does-it-all” node
for green screens, but the best results stem from a combination of techniques.
Note

Garbage Matte is not a node, but a technique selecting what to
exclude from an image. It is a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/../glossary/index.html#term-mask"><span class="xref std std-term">Mask</span></a> used to identify content to be
removed from an image that cannot be removed by an automatic process like
chroma keying. It is used either to select specific content to be removed, or
it is the inverse of a rough selection of the subject; removing everything else.
Some nodes accept a garbage matte directly. For those that don't, you can

still apply one by subtracting the garbage matte from the matte generated
by the node.
Simple garbage mattes can be created with

<span class="orange">Example of a node group.</span>
Grouping nodes can simplify a node tree by allowing instancing and hiding parts of the tree.
Both material and composite nodes can be grouped.

Conceptually, grouping nodes allows you to specify a set of nodes that you can treat as
though it were “just one node”. Node groups are similar to functions in programming.
You can then reuse them inside, which are then called “NodeGroups”,
or in other blend-file(s), when appending called “NodeTrees”.
As an example: If you have created a material that you would like to use with different inputs
e.g. diffuse color: red plastic, green plastic. You could create different materials with Make Single User

for each different color with a copy of the tree part describing the plastic material.
If you like to edit the material you would need to redo the edit on all materials.
A better method of reuse is to create node groups, exposing only the variable inputs (e.g. diffuse color).
Also nested node groups are supported. I.e. a node group can be inserted or created inside another node group.
Note
Recursive node groups are prohibited for all the current node systems to prevent infinite recursion.

A node group can never contain itself (or another group that contains it).

To create a node group, select the nodes you want to include, then
press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-G</kbd>, <span class="saddlebrown">Group ‣ Make Group</span>.
A node group will have a green title bar. All of the selected nodes will now be contained within the node group.

Default naming for the node group is “NodeGroup”, “NodeGroup.001” etc.
There is a name field in the node group you can click into to change the name of the group.
Change the name of the node group to something meaningful.
When appending node groups from one blend-file to another,
Blender does not make a distinction between material node groups or composite node groups,
so it is recommended to use some naming convention that will allow you to easily distinguish between the two types.

Tip
What not to include in node groups:
Remember that the essential idea is that a group should be an easily-reusable,
self-contained software component. Material node groups should not include:
<dt>Input nodes</dt><dd>If you include a source node in your group,
you will end up having the source node appearing twice: once inside the group,

and once outside the group in the new material node tree.</dd>
<dt>Output node</dt><dd>If you include an output node in the group, thwill not be an output socket available from the group!</dd>

it are shown. You can move them around, play with their individual controls, re-thread them internally, etc.
just like you can if they were a normal part of the editor view. You will not be able, though,
to thread them to a node outside the group; you have to use the external sockets on the side of the node group.
While <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> can be used to both enter and exit a group, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Tab</kbd> only exits.

<h3>Interface</h3>
<h4>Interactively</h4>
When a node group is created, new Group Input and Group Output nodes are generated
to represent the data flow into and out of the group. When created, connections to input sockets coming
from unselected nodes will become attached to new sockets on the Group Input node.

Similarly, outgoing connections to input sockets of unselected nodes will become attached to
the new Group Output node.
If during node group development an additional parameter needs to be passed into the group,
an additional socket must be added to the Group Input node.
This is easily done by adding a connection from the hollow socket on the right side of the Group Input node
to the desired input socket on the node requiring input.

The process is similar for the Group Output regarding data
you want to be made available outside the group.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Motion Tracking is used to track the motion of objects and/or a camera and, through the constraints,

to apply this tracking data to 3D objects (or just one), which have either been created in Blender or
imported into the application. Blender's motion tracker supports a couple of very powerful tools for 2D tracking and
3D motion reconstruction, including camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some special features like
the plane track for compositing. Tracks can also be used to move and deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor,
which is available as a special mode in the Movie Clip Editor.
<h2>Views</h2>

In Tracking Mode there are three different views available. You can toggle between view modes using
the View drop-down, which is located in the header.
When you selected a view in the whole area of the Movie Clip editor will change.
Hence, to display a curve or dope sheet view, the editor must be split into two,
with one switched to the curve or dope sheet view.
<h2>Manual Lens Calibration</h2>

All cameras record distorted video.
Nothing can be done about this because of the manner in which optical lenses work.
For accurate camera motion,
the exact value of the focal length and the “strength” of distortion are needed.
Currently, focal length can be automatically obtained only from the camera's settings or from the EXIF information.
There are some external tools which can help to find approximate values to compensate for distortion.

There are also fully manual tools where you can use a grid which is getting affected by distortion model and
deformed cells defines straight lines in the footage.
Within Blender you can use the Annotation tool for this – just draw a line which should be straight on
the footage using poly line brush and adjust the distortion values
to make the annotations match lines on the footage.
To calibrate your camera more accurately, use the Grid calibration tool from OpenCV.

OpenCV is using the same distortion model, so it should not be a problem.
<h2>Camera and Object Motion Solving</h2>
Blender not only supports the solving of camera motion, including tripod shots,
but also the solving of object motion in relation to the motion of the camera.
In addition to that there is the Plane Track, which solves the motion of all markers on one plane.
<h2>Tools for Scene Orientation and Stabilization</h2>

After solve, you need to orient the real scene in the 3D scene for more convenient compositing.
There are tools to define the floor, the scene origin, and the X/Y axes to perform scene orientation.
Sometimes, the video footage includes spurious jumps and tilting movements, like e.g. when using a hand-held camera.
Based on some tracked image elements,
the <a href="clip/properties/stabilization/index.html"><span class="blue">2D Stabilization</span></a>
is able to detect and compensate such movements to improve the quality of the final result.

<span class="orange">Graph View.</span>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The graph or curves view has numerous purposes based on the color of the lines.

The red and green lines on the graph show you the speed of the trackers at a given frame.
Green is vertical movement, Red is horizontal. Therefore the first frames will always be at zero.
The blue line is the line that comes out when you click on the film strip is the average per-frame error.
This curve is available only after pressing camera solve and is not editable.
This is the one line that you want to be as flat as possible and as closer to zero as you can.
The high points will show you where in your shot you are having inaccurate tracking.

Frames outside of scene frame range are darkened.

<h2>Usage</h2>
The curves are useful to see if particular trackers are moving differently than the average.
A line that spikes from the rest of the curve usually means a tracking error.
You can manually edit the curve by selecting a point in the curve and dragging it or deleting,

that will affect the corresponding tracker on that particular frame.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Dope Sheet View</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/movie-clip_tracking_dope-sheet_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Dope Sheet View.</span>
The Dope Sheet View is used to visualize motion tracking data,

it is implemented as separate view of the Movie Clip editor just like the Graph View.
It displays channels for selected tracks and each channel visualizes tracked
segments of tracks as dark bars and keyframed positions of tracks as small diamonds.
The background is highlighted depending on the number of tracks in a frame.
This means that if for a frame (or sequence of frames) there are less than eight tracks,
the background will turn red;

if there are from eight to sixteen tracks, the background will be yellow.
This is only a visual feedback, which doesn't mean that the camera motion will not
reconstruct with less than eight tracks. It only means that you should pay attention to those frames and
check if all possible good feature points are tracked there. Remember, if there are no good feature points in
the frame and there are less than 16 tracks in the frame, it doesn't mean the solution won't be accurate.
Rather, adding more tracks on bad feature points will reduce the accuracy of solution.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Masks can be created in the Image and Movie Clip editors, by changing the mode to Mask in the header.

This will add various tools and properties to the editor panels,
while hiding others that are not needed for interacting with masks.
Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow to mask out,
or influence a particular object in the footage.
They can be used for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the footage,
or as a rough matte for green-screen keying. Masks are independent from a particular image of movie clip,

and so they can just as well be used for creating motion graphics or other effects in the Compositor.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/compositing_types_input_mask_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Using the Mask node to isolate an object in compositing.</span>
While the Movie Clip Editor and Image Editor are used to edit masks,
the Compositor and Sequencer are just using already created mask.
Masks can be animated over the time so that they follow some object from the footage,

e.g. a running actor. This can be achieved with shape keys or parenting the mask to tracking markers.
<h2>Mask Data-block</h2>
Mask data-block containing multiple mask layers and splines.
They are the most high-level entities used for masking purposes.
Masks can be reused in different places, and hold global parameters for all the entities they consist of.

<h2><span class="greenbut">S-Curves</span></h2>
The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bézier curve, but with some differences.
Smooth edges of the mask are defined by feathering.
The curve needed to support feathering in a way that stuck to the curve as you edited it,
for ease of editing an animation. These are called S-curves.
Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the feather between

the current point and the next point on the spline.
Each feather point is stored in UW space,
where U means position across spline segment, and W (weight) means distance between main spline and feather points.
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/movie-clip_masking_scurve_schematic.svg"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/movie-clip_masking_scurve_schematic.svg" width="420px" /></a>
<span class="orange">S-Curve explained.</span>
This allows for deforming the main spline in almost any way,

and the feather will be updated automatically to reflect that change.
For example if there is just rotation of the spline,
feather would stay completely unchanged. If one point's feather is moved,
the other feathers will be automatically stretched uniformly along that segment
and the overall shape will be almost the same as artists would want it to be.

There are two primitives available: a Bézier Circle and a Square with vector handles.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Selecting &amp; Editing</span></h2>
<h2>Selecting</h2>
The usual selection tools are available:
Toggle Select All <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>.
Box and Circle Select <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">B</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">C</kbd>.
Lasso Select <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-LMB</kbd>.

Select Linked with mouse <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">L</kbd>.
Select tracking marker <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-RMB</kbd>.
<h2>Editing</h2>
The tools and panels available to edit masks are the same in both editors.
Editing of mask splines happens in a way similar to editing Bézier curves or paths in GIMP or other curve editors.

Tip
To get interactive feedback on the resulting mask,
a Mask node can be connected directly to a Viewer node in the Compositor,
which will then keep updating the compositing result while editing.

<h3>Example</h3>
The purpose of mask layers can be explained with an example.
Suppose there are two unwanted people in the footage, and one of them goes from left to right, and

the other in the opposite direction. Two mask layers can then be used to mask them separately by
using a single mask data-block. At the point of intersection of these shapes they will be added together rather than
creating a hole, as would happen if they were on the same layer. If the motion is simple enough,
a single motion tracked point can be used to drive the location of the entire mask layer.

Once you have chosen the Proxy/Timecode parameters,
you need to use <span class="saddlebrown">Clip ‣ Proxy ‣ Rebuild Proxy and Timecode indices</span>

<h2>Proxy</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/editors_clip_sidebar_proxy-panel.png" />
A proxy is a smaller image (faster to load) that stands in for the main image.
When you rebuild proxies Blender computes small images (like thumbnails)
for the big images and may take some time. After computing them, though,
editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling is much faster but gives a low-res result.
Make sure to disable proxies before final rendering.

<dt>Timecode</dt><dd>See <a href="#tode">Timecode</a>.</dd>
<dt>Proxy Render Size</dt><dd>Defines which proxy image resolution is used for display.
If Render Undistorted is set, then images created from undistorted frames are used.
If there are no generated proxies, render size is set to “No proxy, full render”,

and if render undistorted is enabled, undistortion will happen automatically on frame refresh.</dd>
<h2>Timecode</h2>
When you are working with footage directly copied from a camera without pre-processing it,
there might be bunch of artifacts, mostly due to seeking a given frame in sequence.
This happens because such footage usually does not have correct frame rate values in their headers.
This issue can still arise when the source clip has the same frame rate as the scene settings.

In order for Blender to correctly calculate frames and frame rate there are two possible solutions:
Preprocess your video with e.g. MEncoder to repair the file header and insert the correct keyframes.
Use Proxy/Timecode option in Blender.
The following timecodes are supported:
No TC in use – do not use any timecode
Record Run

Free Run
Free Run (rec date)
Record Run No Gaps
Note
Record Run is the timecode which usually is best to use, but if the clip's file is totally damaged,
Record Run No Gaps will be the only chance of getting acceptable result.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video.
There are two possible methods for this, one being the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/compositing/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Compositor</span></a>.
However, this chapter describes the other, the Video Sequence Editor (VSE), sometimes shortened to just “Sequencer”.

The Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to combine multiple
video channels and add effects to them. You can use these effects to create powerful video edits,
especially when you combine it with the animation power of Blender!
To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or in some cases, overlay them),
inserting fades and transitions to link the end of one clip to the beginning of another.
Finally, you can add audio and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it.

<h2>View Types</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/video-editing_introduction_types.png" />
The Video Sequence Editor has three view types for the main view:
<dt>Sequencer</dt><dd>View timeline and strip properties.</dd>

<dt>Preview</dt><dd>View preview window and preview properties.</dd>
<dt>Sequencer/Preview</dt><dd>Combined view of preview and time and properties of both.</dd>
It is possible to create multiple instances of any view type in single workspace.
Note
By default the Sequencer is enabled, however, it can be disabled
in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/output/settings.html#render-output-postprocess"><span class="std std-ref">Post Processing Panel</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
The Sequencer region is horizontally divided into channels,
each channel can contain what is called a strip.
A strip can be an image, animation, or any number of effects.

Each channel is numbered consecutively on the Y axis,
starting from zero and allows up to 32 total channels.
The X axis represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips
as it needs as long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap another,
it needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other strip.
When strips are stacked, they stack from bottom to top where the lowest channel

forms the background and the highest the foreground.
Note
The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips.
This is because it is used by the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/preview/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Sequencer Display</span></a>
to show a composite of all strips above channel 0.
This region is where strips can be <a href="selecting.html"><span class="blue">selected</span></a>,

<a href="editing.html"><span class="blue">modified</span></a> by moving, cutting, or extending strips.
There are also several built-in <a href="strips/effects/index.html"><span class="blue">effects</span></a>
that can be combined with other strips to change their appearance.

click the Refresh Sequencer button.
Blender will update and synchronize all cached images and compute the current frame.
Certain operations, like moving an object in the 3D Viewport, may not force the Sequencer
to call for a refresh of the rendered image (since the movement may not affect the rendered image).
If an image or video, used as a strip, is changed by some application outside of Blender,

Blender has no real way of being notified from your operating system.</dd>

The exported file contains all Text strips in the video sequence.</dd>
<h3>Markers Menu</h3>
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/markers.html"><span class="blue">Markers</span></a> are used to denote frames with key points or significant events
within an animation. Like with most animation editors, markers are shown at the bottom of the editor.

<h2>Main View</h2>
<h3>Adjusting the View</h3>
Use these shortcuts to adjust the sequence area of the VSE:

Pan: <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">MMB</kbd>
Zoom: <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Wheel</kbd>
Vertical Scroll: use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Wheel</kbd>, or drag on the left scrollbar.
Horizontal Scroll: use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Wheel</kbd>, or drag on the lower scrollbar.
Scale View: <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-MMB</kbd> and drag up/down (vertical scale) or left/right (horizontal scale).
Scale View Vertically: drag on the circles on the vertical scrollbar.

Scale View Horizontally: drag on the circles on the horizontal scrollbar.
<h3>Playhead</h3>
The playhead is the blue vertical line with the current frame number at the top.
It can be set or moved to a new position by pressing or holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>
in scrubbing area at the top of the timeline.
You can move playhead in increments by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Left</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Right</kbd>,

or you can jump to the beginning or end frame by pressing
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Left</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-Right</kbd>. As you do, the image for that frame is displayed in the Preview region.
When you drag the frame indicator with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-RMB</kbd> directly on a sequence strip,
this will show the strip solo, (temporarily disregarding effects and other strips,
showing only this strip's output) and the strip will be highlighted.
When holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while dragging it will snap to the start and endpoints of strips.

Real-time preview is possible on reasonable computers
when viewing an image sequence or movie (<code><span class="sapphire">avi</span></code>/<code><span class="sapphire">mov</span></code>) file.
Scene strips can use viewport previews or proxies for real-time playback,
otherwise displaying rendered frame is supported, but typically too slow for real-time playback.
Hint
Every other synced editor can be used for scrubbing e.g. the Timeline.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Editing</span></h2>
<h2>Move</h2>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Transform ‣ Move</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd></dd>
Pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd> moves the all selected strip(s).

Move your mouse horizontally (left/right) to change the strip's position in time.
Move vertically (up/down) to change channels.
Holding down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while dragging snaps to the start and endpoints of other strips.
The position of the mouse relative to the selection influences where the strips are snapped.
If it is closer to the start of the selection, then the start frame of the selection gets snapped,
else the end frame will get snapped.

To “ripple edit” (make room for strips you drag) hold <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd> when placing a strip.
You can also lock the direction to time with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">X</kbd> or to change the strip's channel with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Y</kbd>.
It is possible to move strips using mouse by dragging them while holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd>.
Currently it is possible to move only 1 strip by dragging
<h3>Start Frame Offset</h3>
The start frame offset for that strip could be selected by clicking <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on the left arrow of the strip;

holding it down (or pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd> and then moving the mouse left/right)
changes the start frame within the strip by the number of frames you move it.
The frame number label under the strip displays the start frame of the strip.
If you have a 20-image sequence strip, and drag the left arrow to the right by 10 frames,
the strip will start at image 11 (images 1 to 10 will be skipped).
Use this to clip off a roll-up or undesired lead-in.

Dragging the left arrow left will create a lead-in (copies) of the first frame for as many frames as you drag it.
Use this when you want some frames for a transition at the start of the clip.
<h3>End Frame</h3>
The end frame of the strip could be selected by clicking <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> on the right arrow of the strip;
holding it down (or pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd>) and then moving the mouse changes the ending frame within the strip.
The frame number label over the strip displays the end frame of the strip.

Dragging the right arrow to the left shortens the clip;
any original images at the tail are ignored. Use this to quickly clip off a roll-down.
Dragging the right arrow to the right extends the clip.
For movies and images sequences, more of the animation is used until exhausted.
Extending a clip beyond its length will render as a copy of the last image.
Use this for transitions out of this clip.

Note
Multiple selection
You can select several (handles of) strips by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> clicking: when you press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">G</kbd>,
everything that is selected will move with your mouse – this means that,
for example, you can at the same time move a strip, shorten two others, and extend a forth one.
<h2>Move/Extend from Frame</h2>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Transform ‣ Move/Extend From Playhead</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">E</kbd></dd>
With a number of strips selected, pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">E</kbd> lets you interactively extend the strips.

This is similar to moving but is useful for extending (or shortening) time around the current frame.
All selected strip handles to the “mouse side” of the current frame indicator will transform together,
so you can change the duration of the current frame.
<h2>Slip Strip Content</h2>
Reference

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd></dd>
The Slip tool allows you to change the position of the contents of a strip without moving the strip itself.
<h2>Snap Strips</h2>
Reference

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-S</kbd></dd>
Position your playhead (vertical blue line) to the time you want.
Snap to current frame to start a strip exactly at the beginning of the frame.

If your Time display is in seconds,
you can get to fractional parts of a second by zooming the display;
you can get all the way down to an individual frame.
<h2>Set Frame Range</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Transform ‣ Set Preview Range to Strips</span></dd>
Sets the frame range of preview to the range of the selected strips.

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-D</kbd></dd>
Duplicate a strip to make an unlinked copy;
drag it to a time and channel, and drop it by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">LMB</kbd> click.
<h2>Delete Strips</h2>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Delete</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Delete</kbd> / <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">X</kbd></dd>
Delete the selected strip(s).

<h2>Separate Images</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Separate Images</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Y</kbd></dd>

For images sequence only – Converts the strip into multiple strips, one strip for each frame.
Useful for slide shows and other cases where you want to bring in a set on non-continuous images.
<dt>Length</dt><dd>You have to specify the duration you want the rting strips will be.</dd>
<h2>Cut</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Cut</span></dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">K</kbd></dd>
This cuts the selected strip in two at the current frame.
This will result in two strips which use the same source, fitting the original strip's timing and length.
Hint

This can be thought of as a quick way to duplicate the current strip,
adjusting the start/end frames to form two non-overlapping strips showing the same content as before.
<h2>Hold Cut</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Strip ‣ Hold Cut</span></dd>

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-K</kbd></dd>
Like Cut, it cuts a strip in two distinct strips;
however you will not be able to drag the endpoints to show the frames past the cut of each resulting strip.
Although you can adjust the <a href="properties/strip.html#sequencer-duration-hard"><span class="std std-ref">Hold Offset</span></a>
number fields in the Strip Info panel.

Hint
This can be thought of as a way to simulate splitting the video file in two parts at the cut-point,
replacing the current strip with each.
<h2>Mute</h2>
<dt>Mute/Unmute Strips <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">H</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-H</kbd></dt><dde or unmute the selected strips.</dd>

This tool can be used to assign (reconnect) effect strips in a different way.
Just select three arbitrary strips and press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">R</kbd>.

If you don't create a cycle, those will be connected to a new effect chain.
The Strip menu contains additional tools for working with strips:
Insert/Remove Gap
Deinterlace Movies
Set Render Size
Reload Strips

Swap Inputs
Lock Strips

<h2>Context Menu</h2>
You can activate context menu by clicking <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd> in the Sequencer's timeline.

In this menu you can quickly access some common tools such as:
Copy and paste strips
Cut, delete and duplicate strips
Slip strip contents
Snap to playhead
Set Preview Range to Strips

Remove and insert gaps
Lock or mute strips
<h2>Fades</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Add ‣ Fades</span></dd>

This submenu contains tools to add or remove fades to strips.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Meta Strips</span></h2>
A Meta Strip is a strip which contain multiple strips treated as if it was one strip.
It allows you to reduce the vertical space used in the Sequencer.
You can edit it the same way as any other strips.

It is organization tool. For example, if you are using a lot of strips with
complicated arrangement, you can group them together using Meta strips.
<dt>Make Meta Strip <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-G</kbd></dt><dd>To create a Meta strip, select all the strips you want to group, and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-G</kbd> to group them.
The Meta strips will span from the beginning of the first strip to the end of the last one,
and condenses all channels into a single strip.</dd>
<dt>UnMeta Strip <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-G</kbd></dt><dd>Separating (ungrouping) the Meta strip restores the strips to their relative positions and channels.

This can be used if you choose to delete a Meta strip and want to keep the strips inside.</dd>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/video-editing_sequencer_meta_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Example of Meta strips.</span>
You can edit the content inside a Meta strip by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd>.
It will expand the strip to the whole view and hide any other strips.
To exit the Meta strip press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd> again.

Meta strips can also be nested, which make editing them a little confusing.
To exit out one level of Meta Strip make sure you do not have a Meta strips selected when you press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd>.
Note
The default blend mode for a Meta strip is Replace. There are many cases where this alters
the results of the animation so be sure to check the results and adjust the blend mode if necessary.
One convenient use for Meta strips is when you want to apply the same effect to multiple strips.

For example: if you have a video that was recorded in different files and want to add an effect strip.
It is much more convenient to apply a single set of effects
to one Meta strip than applying it to each individual strip.

It is also possible to do the similar task described above with
an <a href="strips/adjustment.html"><span class="blue">Adjustment Layer</span></a> effect strip.

<h2>Gizmos</h2>
You can use gizmos to pan and zoom image in the Sequencer preview region.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Display Mode</span></h2>
The are different display modes available, each having a specific purpose.

<h2>Image Preview</h2>
The Image Preview mode shows you what the resulting video will look like when saved.
This is the main working mode for adding strips and moving them around,
cutting, grouping (making meta) and splicing them through special effects.
<h2>Luma Waveform</h2>
For the selected channel, brightness, or luminosity, is mapped with this display.

A luma waveform allows you to judge the quality of the luminance distribution across the video signal,
you can view a luma waveform instead of the usual output display on every control monitor.
The display plots for every scanline the luminance value. The lines are all drawn on top of each other.
The points get brighter if the lines cross (which is very likely with several hundred scanlines).
You will understand the picture most easily if you plug an oscilloscope to
the Luma-video-output of your television set. It will basically look the same.

In this mode, the vertical axis represents the luminosity: 0 at the bottom, 1 at the top;
the horizontal axis is a mapping from the horizontal axis of the frame.
There are as many curves as scanlines in the frame:
each one of this curves represents the luminosity of the pixels of one line.
Moreover, the color of a pixel in this mode represents the number of pixels from the matching column of
the frame sharing the same luminosity, i.e. the number of curves that cross at this point

(black/transparent, for no pixel, white/opaque for at least three pixels).
<dt>Separate Colors</dt><dd>Separates RGB channels into separate grap</dd>
This mode is good for:
If the waveform does not fill the whole picture you might want to play with the Bright/Contrast modifier
until it fills the whole picture (contrast autostretch).
With the more advanced Curves or Color Balance modifiers, you can be more precise.

You can judge if you want to dump the whole thing since it is
completely distorted and clips at the top or the bottom.

<span class="orange">The various horizontal lines in the Luma waveform

one-pixel width line (inside the yellow strip) is represented in the Luma waveform by a gray line.
The two lines drawing an “X” are from the two linear tone shades (white –&gt; black and black –&gt; white).
Finally, the broken line matches the complex tone shade at the bottom of the picture.</span>

</td>

</tbody>

</table>
Note
The pictures (first green frame, at the top) are only 50px high,
to limit the number of curves displayed in the Luma waveform.
Use this display to check for appropriate contrast and luminosity across all frames in the channel.
When spots in the film that should have even illumination do not,

it looks like a flashbulb went off or an extra light was suddenly turned on. This can happen
if two strips were rendered or shot under different lighting conditions but are supposed to be contiguous.
<h2>Chroma Vectorscope</h2>
Use this mode judge the quality of the color-distribution and saturation, you can also view a U/V scatter-plot.
The picture is converted to YUV-format. The U and V values represent the angle of the color.
For pixel of the picture, one point is plotted in the display at the U and V value position.

If several pixels happen to have the same UV value the pixel in the plot gets brighter.
To help you understand what color is meant, a hexagram marking the extreme positions
(red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow) is shown and a red cross to mark the origin.
In other words, for the selected channel, this display shows the color space of the image inside a hexagon.
Each point of the hexagon is a primary color: red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, and yellow.
Black is at the center, and overall saturation is scaled as dots closer to the outside.

The example to the right shows that the image has a lot of red (50% saturation)
and small amount of blue, with no green.
Always: remember to activate an additional control monitor of the end result.
Color calibration is a matter of taste and depends on what you want.
Use this display to check for too much color saturation.
While over-saturated images look great for op-art and computer displays,

they might not when shown on the big screen TV.
This mode is good for:
If you picture looks very moody or desaturated you might want to take a look at the U/V plot.
You will most likely see all pixels building a crowd at the origin.
If you add saturation using the Saturation slider in the Filter panel or any modifiers that change color,
you can see in the U/V plot if you distort the color.

If you do color-matching on a by hand basis you can match the angle you see of different channels monitors.

<h2>Histogram</h2>

This mode displays a graph showing the distribution of color information in the pixels of
the currently displayed image. The X axis represents values of pixel, from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 255),
while the Y axis represents the number of pixels in that tonal range. A predominantly dark
image would have most of its information toward the left side of the graph.
Use this mode to balance out the tonal range in an image.
A well balanced image should have nice and smooth distribution of color values.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Introduction</span></h2>
Each blend-file contains a database.
This database contains all scenes, objects, meshes, textures, etc. that are in the file.
A file can contain multiple scenes and each scene can contain multiple objects.

Objects can contain multiple materials which can contain many textures.
It is also possible to create links between different objects, or share data between objects.
A file can link data from other Blender files.
<h2>Outliner</h2>
You can easily inspect the contents of your file by using the Outliner editor,
which displays all of the data in your blend-file.

The Outliner allows you to do simple operations on objects,
such as selecting, renaming, deleting, linking and parenting.

<h2>Relative Paths</h2>
Many blend-files reference external images or other linked blend-files.
A path tells Blender where to look for these files.
If the external files are moved, the blend-file that references them will not look right.
When you specify one of these external files, the default option is to make the path relative.

Blender stores a partial path evaluated relative to the directory location of the referencing blend-file.
This choice helps when you need to reorganize folders or move your files.
With a relative path, you can move the blend-file to a new location provided
the externally linked files are moved along with it.
For example, you could send someone a folder that contains a blend-file
and a subfolder of external images that it references.

When relative paths are supported, the File Browser provides a Relative Path checkbox,
when entering the path into a text field, use a double slash prefix (<code><span class="sapphire">//</span></code>) to make it so.
Relative paths are the default but this can be changed
in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/file_paths.html"><span class="blue">File</span></a> tab of the Preferences.
Note
You cannot use relative paths into a new untitled blend-file.

Save it before linking to external files.
Hint
If it is necessary to relocate a blend-file relative to its linked resources,
use Blender's File <a href="#files-blend-save"><span class="std std-ref">Save As…</span></a>
function which has an option to Remap Relative file links.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Packed Data</span></h2>

Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate)
various kinds of data within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-file.
For example, an image texture that is an external image file can be put “inside” the blend-file.
This allows to share a full project as a single file,
instead of e.g. an archive containing the blend-file and all of its dependencies.
You know that a data is packed when see a little “gift box” icon displayed next to its path.

Warning
Not all external files can be packed
Some typically heavy external files, like video ones from the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Sequence Editor</span></a>
or <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/clip/introduction.html"><span class="blue">Movie Clips</span></a>, cannot be packed in a blend-file.
<h2>Pack Data</h2>
<h3>Pack All</h3>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ External Data ‣ Pack All Into .blend</span></dd>
Mark all eligible external files used by the blend-file as packed.
Actual packing will happen on next save of the blend-file.
<h3>Automatically Pack</h3>

Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Panel</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ External Data ‣ Automatically Pack Into .blend</span></dd>
When enabled, this option will ensure that all eligible external files, existing or added later,
are systematically marked as packed.
As with Pack All Into .blend, the blend-file must be saved to drive for this to have an effect.

Disabling that option won't unpack anything, but future external files
won't be automatically marked as packed anymore.
<h3>Selective Packing</h3>
A single file can be packed by clicking on the little “gift box” icon to the left of its file-path UI widget.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Blend-Files Previews</span></h2>

A blend-file can store previews, both for itself, and for some of its <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/data_blocks.html"><span class="blue">data-blocks</span></a>.
You can disable writing any previews when saving a blend-file using the Save Preview Images setting
from the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/save_load.html#prefs-save-load"><span class="std std-ref">Save &amp; Load</span></a> section of the Preferences.
<h2>Blend-File Preview</h2>
Blender saves by default a small preview of current scene in the blend-file.
This will show in the Thumbnail view of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/file_browser.html"><span class="blue">File Browser</span></a>.

During its installation, Blender also adds a small tool to your OS,
that will allow your system file browser to show those previews as file thumbnails as well.
<h2>Data-Blocks Previews</h2>
Blender will generate automatically previews for some type of data, mainly shading-related ones
(images, textures, materials, lights, worlds).
It can also store previews for scenes, collections and objects, but those need to be generated manually.

These previews can then be used by the Thumbnail view of the File Browser, when linking or appending data-blocks.
<h3>Refresh Data-Block Previews</h3>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ Data Previews ‣ Refresh Data-blocks Previews</span></dd>
Refresh all data-blocks' previews that can be automatically generated by Blender (shading-related ones),

in the current blend-file. You still need to save the file if you want to write them on drive.
<h3>Clear Data-Block Previews</h3>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ Data Previews ‣ Clear Data-blocks Previews</span></dd>
Clear all, a generic type of, or a specific data-block type of previews in the current blend-file.

You still need to save the file if you want to clear them from drive.
<h3>Batch Generate Previews</h3>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ Data Previews ‣ Batch Generate Previews</span></dd>
Generate some data-block types' previews (you can choose which in its options),

in one or more blend-file on your drive. You should not use that operator on the file currently opened in Blender.
This is currently the only way to generate and store in blend-files previews for scenes, collections and objects.
Note that since this involves a lot of rendering, even of small sizes, the process may take some time to complete.
<h3>Batch Clear Previews</h3>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ Data Previews ‣ Batch Clear Previews</span></dd>
Clear some data-block types' previews (you can choose which in its options),
in one or more blend-file on your drive. You should not use that operator on the file currently opened in Blender.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Rename</span></h2>
<h2>Rename Active Item</h2>

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">F2</kbd></dd>
The Rename Active Item operator renames the active
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/armatures/bones/index.html"><span class="blue">Bone</span></a>,

<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/nodes/index.html"><span class="blue">Node</span></a>,

<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/video_editing/sequencer/strips/index.html"><span class="blue">Sequence Strip</span></a>.
When the operator is executed, a pop-up dialog appears.
The text field shows the name of the current item and can be overwritten to rename the item.
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd> confirms the name while <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Esc</kbd> cancels the operator.

<h2>Batch Rename</h2>

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-F2</kbd></dd>

The Batch Rename operator can rename many data-block names at once.
This uses a pop-up dialog with operations and their options to change the name.
These actions are applied in order, from first to last.
<dt>Data Type</dt><dd>The <a hrefps://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/data_blocks.html#data-system-datablock-types"><span class="std std-ref">data-block type</span></a> to perform the batch rename operations on.</dd>

<dt>All</dt><dd>Operates on all data in the blend file.</dd>
To the left of this option gives a readout on how many data-blocks are able to be renamed.</dd>
<h3>Operations</h3>
The Batch Rename has several sub Operations to change the data names.
The default operation is Find/Replace however, other operations can be added
to modify the data names farther.

<h4>Find/Replace</h4>
Find/Replace searches for a particular string in the names and optionally replaces it with a new string.
<dt>Find</dt><dd>The string of text to look for in names.</dd>
<dt>Replace</dt><dd>The string of text to replace for in matching namound from the Find string.</dd>
<dt>Regular Expressions</dt><dd>Enables the use of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a>
which are a powerful way to tailor the Find/Replace strings.</dd>

<dt>Case Sensitive</dt><dd>Search results must match the F/em> string's case exactly.</dd>
<h4>Set Name</h4>
Set Name works the most similar to <a href="#rename-active-item">Rename Active Item</a>
by renaming the current data-block without having to do a find and replace operation.
<dt>Method</dt><dd>
<dt>New</dt><dd>Disregards the current name replacing it with the “newme.</dd>

<dt>Prefix</dt><dd>Adds text to the beginning of the current name.
This is useful for tools that look for special text in the prefix of a data-block name.</dd>
<dt>Suffix</dt><dd>Adds text to the end of the current name.
This is useful for tools that look for special text in the suffix of a data-block name.</dd></dd>
<dt>Name</dt><dd>Defines the new name or the text to add as a prefix/sx.</dd>
<h4>Strip Characters</h4>

Strip Characters cleans up names by removing certain
character types from either the beginning or the end of the name.
<dt>Spaces</dt><dd>Strips any space characters from the name, e.g.ving Room   ” becomes “Living Room”.</dd>
<dt>Digits</dt><dd>Strips any numerical characters from the name, e.code><span class="sapphire">cube.001</span></code> becomes <code><span class="sapphire">cube.</span></code>.</dd>
<dt>Punctuation</dt><dd>Strips any punctuation characters (<codass="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="sapphire">,.?!:;</span></code> etc.) from the name, e.g. <code><span class="sapphire">cube?</span></code> becomes <code><span class="sapphire">cube</span></code>.</dd>
Tip

Multiple character types can be removed at once by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> on the types.
<dt>Start</dt><dd>Strips and any leading characters in the name.</dd>
<dt>End</dt><dd>Strips and any trailing characters in the name.</dd>
<h4>Change Case</h4>
Change Case modifies the case of names to be on of the following:
<dt>Upper Case</dt><dd>Changes all text to be in upper case, e.g. <codass="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="sapphire">cube.001</span></code> becomes <code><span class="sapphire">CUBE.001</span></code>.</dd>

<dt>Lower Case</dt><dd>Changes all text to be in lower case, e.g. <codass="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="sapphire">CUBE.001</span></code> becomes <code><span class="sapphire">cube.001</span></code>.</dd>
<dt>Title Caps</dt><dd>Changes all text to be in title case, e.g. <codass="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="sapphire">living</span> <span class="sapphire">room</span></code> becomes <code><span class="sapphire">Living</span> <span class="sapphire">Room</span></code>.</dd>
<h2>Data-Blocks</h2>
The base unit for any Blender project is the data-block. Examples of data-blocks include:
meshes, objects, materials, textures, node trees, scenes, texts, brushes, and even Workspaces.

<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/files_data-blocks_outliner-blender-file-view.png" />
<span class="orange">Blender File view of the Outliner.</span>
A data-block is a generic abstraction of very different kinds of data,
which features a common set of basic features, properties and behaviors.
Some common characteristics:
They are the primary contents of the blend-file.

They can reference to each other, for reuse and instancing.
(Child/parent, object/object-data, materials/images, in modifiers or constraints too…)
Their names are unique within a blend-file, for a given type.
They can be added/removed/edited/duplicated.
They can be linked between files (only enabled for a limited set of data-blocks).
They can have their own animation data.

They can have <a href="#files-data-blocks-custom-properties"><span class="std std-ref">Custom Properties</span></a>.
User will typically interact with the higher level data types (objects, meshes, etc.).
When doing more complex projects, managing data-blocks becomes more important,
especially when inter-linking blend-files.
The main editor for that is the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/outliner.html"><span class="blue">Outliner</span></a>.
Not every data in Blender is a data-block,

bones, sequence strips or vertex groups e.g. are not,
they belong to armature, scene and mesh types respectively.
<h2>Life Time</h2>
Every data-block has its usage counted (reference count), when there is more than one,
you can see the number of current users of a data-block to the right of its name in the UI.
Blender follows the general rule that unused data is eventually removed.

Since it is common to add and remove a lot of data while working,
this has the advantage of not having to manually manage every single data-block.
This works by skipping zero user data-blocks when writing blend-files.
<h3>Protected</h3>
Since zero user data-blocks are not saved,
there are times when you want to force the data to be kept irrespective of its users.

If you are building a blend-file to serve as a library of things that you intend to link to and from other files,
you will need to make sure that they do not accidentally get deleted from the library file.
To protect a data-block, use the button with the shield icon next to its name.
The data-block will then never be silently deleted by Blender,
but you can still do it manually if needed.
<h2>Sharing</h2>

Data-blocks can be shared among other data-blocks.
Examples where sharing data is common:
Sharing textures among materials.
Sharing meshes between objects (instances).
Sharing animated actions between objects,
for example to make all the lights dim together.

You can also share data-blocks between files, see:
<a href="linked_libraries/index.html"><span class="blue">linked libraries</span></a>.
<h2>Making Single User</h2>
When a data-block is shared between several users, you can make a copy of it for a given user.
To do so, click on the user count button to the right of its name.
This will duplicate that data-block and assign the newly created copy to that usage only.

Note
Objects have a set of more advanced actions to become single-user,
see <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/editing/duplication.html"><span class="blue">their documentation</span></a>.
<h2>Removing Data-Blocks</h2>
As covered in <a href="#life-time">Life Time</a>, data-blocks are typically removed when they are no longer used.
They can also be manually unlinked or deleted.

Unlinking a data-block means that its user won't use it anymore.
This can be achieved by clicking on the “X” icon next to a data-block's name.
If you unlink a data-block from all of its users,
it will eventually be deleted by Blender as described above (unless it is a protected one).
Deleting a data-block directly erases it from the blend-file, automatically unlinking it from all of its users.
This can be achieved by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> on the “X” icon next to its name.

Warning
Deleting some data-blocks can lead to deletion of some of its users, which would become invalid without it.
The main example is that object-data deletion (like mesh, curve, camera…) will also delete all objects using it.
Those two operations are also available in the context menu
when <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">RMB</kbd>-clicking on a data-block in the Outliner.

<h2>Custom Properties</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/files_data-blocks_add.png" />
<span class="orange">Custom Properties panel.</span>
Custom properties are a way to store your own data in Blender's data-blocks.

It can be used for rigging (where bones and objects can have custom properties driving other properties),
and Python scripts, where it's common to define new settings not available in Blender.
Only certain data supports custom properties:
All <a href="#data-system-datablock-types"><span class="std std-ref">data-blocks types</span></a>.
Bones and pose bones.
Sequence strips.

To add a custom property, search for the Custom Properties panel,
found at the bottom of most <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/properties_editor.html"><span class="blue">Properties Editor</span></a> or Sidebar region, and hit Add.
<h3>Editing Properties</h3>
<h4>User Interface</h4>
Custom properties can be edited using the panel available for data types that support it.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/files_data-blocks_edit.png" />

<span class="orange">Custom Properties edit pop-up.</span>
<dt>Property Name</dt><dd>The name of the custom property.</dd>
<dt>Property Value</dt><dd>This does two things: first it sets the current value of the custom property, and
second, it defines the data type of the property.
Custom properties can be of the following types: Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans,
or short vectors of Integers or Floats.

See the table below for a list of examples for each:
<dt class="field-odd">Integers</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">1, 2, 3, 4,</dd>
<dt class="field-even">Floats</dt>
<dd class="field-even">3.141, 5.0, 6.125,</dd>
<dt class="field-odd">Strings</dt>

<dd class="field-odd">any text,</dd>
<dt class="field-even">Booleans</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><code><span class="sapphire">True</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">False</span></code></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">Vectors</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><code><span class="sapphire">[1,</span> <span class="sapphire">2,</span> <span class="sapphire">3]</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">[1.0,</span> <span class="sapphire">2.0,</span> <span class="sapphire">3.0]</span></code></dd>
Note

Booleans are handled very similar to integers and only work
when using Min/Max values that are integers and that are no more than 1 apart.
At this point, the booleans will still look like integers but behave like
booleans having one lower, off, value and a higher, on, value.
</dd>
<dt>Default Value</dt><dd>This sets the default value of the property used by the Reset to Default Value operator.

Warning
Default values are used as the basis of <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/nla/properties_modifiers.html#nla-blend-modes"><span class="std std-ref">NLA blending</span></a>,
and a nonsensical default (e.g. 0 for a property used for scaling) on a property intended for
being keyframed is likely to cause issues.

<h4>Python Access</h4>
Custom properties can be accessed in a similar way to

<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">dictionaries</a>,
with the constraints that keys can only be strings,
and values can only be strings, numbers, arrays of such, or nested properties.

These functions help you reuse materials, objects and other <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/data_blocks.html"><span class="blue">data-blocks</span></a>

loaded from another blend-file.
You can build libraries of common content and share them across multiple referencing files.

Link creates a reference to the data in the source file such that
changes made there will be reflected in the referencing file the next time it is reloaded.
But linked data is not editable (to some extent, see <a href="library_proxies.html#object-proxy"><span class="std std-ref">Proxies</span></a>).
Append makes a full copy of the data into your blend-file, without keeping any reference to original one.
You can make further edits to your local copy of the data,
but changes in the external source file will not be reflected in the referencing file.

In the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/file_browser.html"><span class="blue">File Browser</span></a>,
navigate to the external source blend-file and select the data-block you want to reuse.
Tip
Blend-files can also be linked/appended by dragging and dropping blend-files into the Blender window.
<h3>Options</h3>

<dt>Localize All</dt><dd>Appends also all indirectly linked data, ind of linking them.</dd>
When you link an object, it will be placed in your scene at the 3D cursor position.
Many other data types, cameras, curves, and materials for example,
must be linked to an object before they become visible.
Newly added collections types are available in <span class="saddlebrown">Add ‣ Collection Instance</span> in the 3D View.
Look in the Outliner, with display mode set to Blender File, to see all your linked and appended data-blocks.

Note
Appending data you already have linked will add objects/collections to the scene,
but will keep them linked (and un-editable).
This is done so existing relationships with linked data remain intact.
<h2>Library Reload &amp; Relocate</h2>
From the context menu of the library items in the Outliner's Blender File view,

you can reload and relocate a whole library.
Reloading is useful if you changed something in the library blend-file and want to see those changes
in your current blend-file without having to re-open it.
Relocating allows you to reload the library from a new file path.
This can be used to either fix a broken linked library
(e.g. because the library file was moved or renamed after linking from it),

or to switch between different variations of a same set of data, in different library files.
<h3>Broken Library</h3>
While loading a blend-file, if Blender cannot find a library,
it will create placeholder data-blocks to replace missing linked ones.
That way, references to the missing data is not lost, and by relocating the missing library,
the lost data can be automatically restored.

<h2>Make Local</h2>

Makes the selected or all external objects local to the current blend-file.
Links to the original library file will be lost,
but it will make those data-blocks fully editable, just like the ones directly created in that blend-file.
<h3>Options</h3>
The operation available from the Outliner's context menu has no options, and only affects the selected data-block.

The operation available from the 3D View only directly affects selected objects,
but it can also make local the objects' dependencies:
<dt>Type</dt><dd>Optionally unlinks the object's Object Data and Material Data.
Selected Objects, + Object Data, + Materials, All (i.e. including all scenes)</dd>
<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
For the most part linking data will work as expected, however,

there are some corner cases which are not supported.
<h3>Circular Dependencies</h3>
In general, dependencies should not go in both directions.
Attempting to link or append data which links back to the current file will likely result in missing links.
<h3>Object Rigid Body Constraints</h3>
When linking objects directly into a blend-file, the Rigid Body settings

will not be linked in since they are associated with their scene's world.
As an alternative, you could link in the entire scene and set it as a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/scene/properties.html#scene-background-set"><span class="std std-ref">Background Set</span></a>.
<h3>Compression &amp; Memory Use</h3>
Linking to blend files with compression enabled may significantly increase memory usage while loading files.
Reading data on demand isn't supported with compression
(this only impacts load time, once loaded there is no difference in memory use).

<h2></h2><span id="bpy-ops-object-proxy-make"></
span><h2>Proxies</h2>
Proxies are the historical way in Blender to allow some local editing of linked data-blocks.
This is mostly aimed at character animation.
One of their most important restrictions is that you can only have one proxy
of any linked object in a given blend-file.

A new system, more powerful and flexible, is currently being implemented:
<a href="library_overrides.html"><span class="blue">Library Overrides</span></a>.
<h2>Proxy Objects</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Editor</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">3D View</dd>

<dt class="field-even">Mode</dt>
<dd class="field-even">Object Mode</dd>
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Object ‣ Relations ‣ Make Proxy…</span></dd>
This makes the active linked object into a local proxy, appending “_proxy” to its name.
It allows you to make changes locally over an object (or collection) linked from an external library.

Possible changes are restricted, you can mainly edit and animate transformations of the proxy object,
and its constraints.
Those changes remain local, they are not sent back to the external library.
Hint
Another way to transform a linked object locally is with
the use of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/collection.html"><span class="blue">Collection Instancing</span></a>.

Instead of linking objects directly, it is often more useful to link in collections,
which can be assigned to empties and moved, while maintaining the link to the original file.
It is also useful to be able to add/remove objects from the collection (from within the library blend-file)
without having to manage re-linking of multiple objects.
<h3>Proxy Armatures</h3>
On rigged models, proxy objects allow you to edit and animate their poses.

It is also possible, in the source (library) blend-file, to protect some bone layers from being editable in proxies.
This helps keeping complex rigs usage sensible, by only exposing some ‘public' bone layers as editable by users.
Set the Protected Layers in the source file using the Skeleton panel of the Armatures properties.
See <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/armatures/properties/skeleton.html#armature-layers"><span class="std std-ref">Armature Layers</span></a>.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Library Overrides</span></h2>
Library Overrides is the new system designed to replace and

supersede <a href="library_proxies.html"><span class="blue">Proxies</span></a>.
Most types of linked data-blocks can be overridden, and the properties of those overrides
can then be edited. When the library data change, unmodified properties of the override one
will be updated accordingly.
Note
It is considered as experimental, and current proxy system will be kept alongside for a few releases.

Automatic conversion from proxies to library overrides is not planned,
there will be a manual operator to do that, but results on complex characters are not guaranteed.
Compared to proxies, library overrides support:
Multiple independent overrides of a same linked data (e.g. a whole character).
Adding new modifiers and constraints, anywhere in the stack.
Recursively chaining overrides (i.e. link and override overrides from another library file, etc.).

Note
There are still many known TODOs/issues that have to be addressed.
Please check the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/2.81/Library_Overrides">release notes</a>
and Phabricator <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.blender.org/T53500">main task of the project</a>, for more details.
<h2>Creating an Override</h2>
There are two ways to create an override of a linked data-block.

<h3>Single Data-Block Override</h3>
You can override a single data-block from two places:
The Outliner (it's in the context menu of IDs), in which case all local usages
of that linked ID will be remapped to the new local override.
The data-block menu in the UI (<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift-LMB</kbd> on the chain icon to the right),
in which case only that specific usage will be remapped to the new local override.

<h3>Make Library Override Operator</h3>
This one operates in the 3D View, over linked objects or local empties instantiating a linked collection
(typically, a linked character). It is very similar to the Make Proxy operator,
and is found in the same sub-menu <span class="saddlebrown">Object ‣ Relations ‣ Make Library Overrides…</span>.
Unlike the method described above, it will go through the whole hierarchy of collections and objects,
and override all those needed to allow posing/animation of a character.

Note
Proper Collections Layout Matters
For this operator to work properly, it is crucial that all the collections needed by
the character are children of the root (linked and instantiated) one.
Otherwise, some won't be automatically overridden, and manual work will be needed to fix the override.
<h2>Editing an Override</h2>

Essentially, and override is edited the same way as a regular local data-block.
You can use operators on them, edit their properties from various editors, etc.
There are some limitations however, most notably Edit Mode is not allowed currently for override.
In most cases, as soon as you edit a property, you can see that it's overridden by it's teal blue
outline/background (like the yellow/green/purple colors of animated/driven ones).
You can also animate overrides, animated properties just replace/supersede overrides then.

Note that you cannot override-edit an existing animation, you'll have to create a new action.
You can manually define or remove an override from the context menu of the relevant property.

Hint
If you are not interested in technical details,
a good rule of thumb for selecting output formats for your project is:
<dt>Use OpenEXR</dt><dd>if you intend to do compositing or color grg on these images.</dd>
<dt>Use PNG</dt><dd>if you intend on-screen output or encoding into iple video formats.</dd>

<dt>Use JPEG</dt><dd>for on-screen output where file size is a con and quality loss is acceptable.</dd>
All these formats support compression which can be important when rendering out animations.
Hint
Bit depths for image formats represent the following numbers of tonal levels per channel:
<dt class="field-odd">8</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">256 levels</dd>

<dt class="field-even">10</dt>
<dd class="field-even">1024 levels</dd>
<dt class="field-odd">12</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">4096 levels</dd>
<dt class="field-even">16</dt>
<dd class="field-even">65536 levels</dd>

<h2>Opening Images</h2>
<dt>Relative Path</dt><dd>Sets the file path to be relative to the currently open blend-file.
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/blend/open_save.html#files-blend-relative-paths"><span class="std std-ref">Relative Paths</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Detect Sequences</dt><dd>Automatically looks for image sequences in the selected images (based on the file name).
Disable this when you do want to get single images that are part of a sequence.</dd>
<dt>Detect UDIMs</dt><dd>Automatically looks for <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/editing/uv/workflows/udims.html"><span class="blue">UDIM</span></a>

tiles in the directory of the selected image; if matches are found they are loaded into Blender as UDIMs.
This works by detecting if the filename has a <code><span class="sapphire">.xxxx</span></code> (four digit number) before the file extension.</dd>
<h3>Opening an Image Sequence</h3>
The filename of the images must contain a digit, indicating the frame.
The sequence could be opened by the selection of the images and
by the confirmation with the Open Image button or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Return</kbd>.

<h2>Saving Images</h2>
<dt>File Format</dt><dd>Choose what format to save the image as.</dd>
<dt>Color Mode</dt><dd>Choose the color format to save the image (or video) to.
Note that RGBA is not available for all image formats, check the list above for details.
BW, RGB, RGBA</dd>
<dt>Color Depth</dt><dd>Some image file formats support a varying number of bits per pixel.

This affects the color quality and file size. Commonly used depths:
<dt>8 bit (256 levels)</dt><dd>Most common for on-screen graphics and o.</dd>
<dt>10, 12, 16 bit</dt><dd>Used for some formats focusing on photography and digital films
(such as DPX and JPEG 2000).</dd>
<dt>16 bit half float</dt><dd>Since full 32bit float is often more than enough precision,
half float can save drive space while still providing a high dynamic range.</dd>

<dt>32 bit float</dt><dd>Highest quality color depth.</dd>
Note
Internally Blender's image system supports either:
8 bit per channel (4 × 8 bits).
32 bit float per channel (4 × 32 bits) – using 4 times as much memory.
Images higher than 8 bits per channel will be converted into a float on loading into Blender.

</dd>
<dt>Compression</dt><dd>Used to reduce the size of the image file.
How this is done may vary depending on the file format and settings used.</dd>

<h2>Format Details</h2>
<h3>Cineon &amp; DPX</h3>
Cineon is Kodak's standard for film scanning, 10 bits/channel and logarithmic.
DPX has been derived from Cineon as the ANSI/SMPTE industry standard.

DPX supports 16 bits color/channel, linear as well as logarithmic.
DPX is currently a widely adopted standard used in the film hardware/software industry.
DPX as well as Cineon only stores and converts the “visible” color range of values between 0.0
and 1.0 (as a result of rendering or composite).
<h3>OpenEXR</h3>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openexr.com/">ILM's OpenEXR</a> has become a software industry standard

for HDR image files, especially because of its flexible and expandable structure.
An OpenEXR file can store multiple layers and passes.
This means OpenEXR images can be loaded into a Compositor keeping render layers and passes intact.
<h4>Output Options</h4>
Available options for OpenEXR render output are:
<dt>Color Depth</dt><dd>Half saves images in a custom 16 bits per channel floating point format.

This reduces the actual “bit depth” to 10 bits, with a 5 bits power value and 1 bit sign.
Float (Half), Float (Full)</dd>
<dt>Codec</dt><dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">PXR24</span></code></dt><dd>Lossy algorithm from Pixar, converting 32 bits floats tobits floats.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">ZIP</span></code></dt><dd>Standard lossless compression using Zlib, operatin 16 scanlines at a time.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">PIZ</span></code></dt><dd>Lossless wavelet compression. Compresses images with grwell.</dd>

<dt><code><span class="sapphire">RLE</span></code></dt><dd>Run-length encoded, lossless, works well when scanlihave same values.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">ZIPS</span></code></dt><dd>Standard lossless compression using Zlib, operating on ngle scanline at a time.</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">DWAA</span></code></dt><dd>JPEG-like lossy algorithm from DreamWorks.</dd></dd>
<dt>Z Buffer</dt><dd>Save the depth information.
In Blender, this now is written in floats too,
denoting the exact distance from the camera.</dd>

<dt>Preview</dt><dd>On rendering animations (or single frames via command line),
Blender saves the same image also as a JPEG, for quick preview or download.</dd>
<h3>Radiance HDR</h3>
Radiance is a suite of tools for lighting simulation.
Since Radiance had the first (and for a long time the only) HDR image format,
this format is supported by many other software packages.

Radiance <code><span class="sapphire">.hdr</span></code> files store colors still in 8 bits per component, but with an additional
(shared) 8 bits exponent value, making it 32 bits per pixel.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Supported Video &amp; Audio Formats</span></h2>
<h2>Video Formats</h2>
These formats are primarily used for compressing rendered sequences into a playable movie
(they can also be used to make plain audio files).

A codec is a little routine that compresses the video so that it will fit on a Blu-ray,
or be able to be streamed out over the Internet, over a cable, or just be a reasonable file size.
Codecs compress the channels of a video down to save space and enable continuous playback.
Lossy codecs make smaller files at the expense of image quality,
while lossless codecs compress as much as possible the video, but without losing any existing data.
Some codecs, like H.264, are great for larger images. Codecs are used to encode and decode the movie,

and so must be present on both the encoding machine (Blender) and the target machine.
The results of the encoding are stored in a container file.
There are dozens, if not hundreds, of codecs, including Xvid, H.264, DivX, Microsoft,
and so on. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and compatibility with different players on
different operating systems.
Note

Most codecs can only compress the RGB or YUV <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-color-space"><span class="xref std std-term">color space</span></a>,
but some support the Alpha channel as well. Codecs that support RGBA include:
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFV1">FFmpeg video codec #1</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a>
Quicktime
PNG TIFF Pixlet is not lossless, and may be only available on macOS.

Blender offers three ways to export videos, in the File Format selector of the Output properties:
<dt>AVI JPEG</dt><dd>AVI but with JPEG compression.
Lossy, smaller files but not as small as you can get with a Codec compression algorithm.
JPEG compression is also the one used in the DV format used in digital camcorders.</dd>
<dt>AVI Raw</dt><dd>Audio-Video Interlaced (AVI) uncompressed frames.</dd>
<dt>FFmpeg video</dt><dd>FFmpeg codec compression. Which codecs are available depends on the operating system and FFmpeg version.

This options allows for a lot of different encodings, some presets are available
(to the right of the Encoding sub-panel) to help getting started.
This option is also the only one allowing to export audio.</dd>

<h2>Importing &amp; Exporting Files</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><span class="saddlebrown">Topbar ‣ File ‣ Import/Export</span></dd>

Sometimes you may want to utilize files that either came from other 2D or 3D software,
or you may want to use the things you have made in Blender and edit them in other software.
Luckily, Blender offers a wide range of file formats (e.g. OBJ, FBX, 3DS, PLY, STL, etc.)
that can be used to import and export.
Popular formats are enabled by default, other formats are also supported and distributed with Blender,
these can be enabled in the Preferences through the use of <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/addons.html"><span class="blue">Add-ons</span></a>.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Alembic</span></h2>
From the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.alembic.io/">Alembic home page</a>:
<blockquote>
Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic distills complex, animated
scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent set of baked geometric results.
This ‘distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of

lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data.
Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex procedural geometric constructions.
It is very specifically not concerned with storing the complex dependency graph
of procedural tools used to create the computed results.
For example, Alembic will efficiently store the animated vertex positions and
animated transforms that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process

which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving simulations,
cloth and flesh simulations, and so on.
Alembic will not attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, basically)
which are required to produce the final, animated vertex positions and animated transforms.
</blockquote>
<abbr title="Too long; didn't read.">TL;DR</abbr>: Alembic can be used to write an animated mesh to a drive, and

read it back quickly and efficiently. This means that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-intensive rig,
‘baked' to an Alembic file, and loaded into the shot file for shading and lighting
with only moderate CPU usage.
Support for the Alembic file format was introduced in
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/2.78">Blender 2.78</a>.
Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard as well as

the C++ library implementing that standard, Blender can be used in a hybrid pipeline.
For example, other software, such as Houdini or Maya, can export files to Alembic,
which can then be loaded, shaded, and rendered in Blender.
It is also possible to animate characters (or other models) in Blender, export to Alembic, and
load those files into other software for further processing.
<h2>Exporting to Alembic Files</h2>

This section describes the effect of the different export options.
<h3>Manual Transform</h3>

<dt>Scale</dt><dd>This sets the global scale of the Alembic file. Keep it at the default value of 1.0 to use
Blender's units.</dd>

<h3>Scene Options</h3>
<dt>Start Frame and End Frame</dt><dd>Sets the frame range to et to Alembic. This defaults to the current scene frame range.</dd>
<dt>Sub-frame Sampling</dt><dd>These options control the sub-frame sampling of animations.
<dt>Transform Samples</dt><dd>Transform Samples sets the number of times per frame at which animated transformations

<dt>Geometry Samples</dt><dd>Geometry Samples sets the same, but  for animated geometry.</dd>

<dt>Shutter Open/Close</dt><dd>Shutter Open/Close define the interval [open, close] over which those samples are taken.
The valid range is -1 to 1, where -1 indicates the previous frame,
0 indicates the current frame, and 1 indicates the next frame.
For example, if information for detailed mesh motion blur is desired, some subframes around
the current frame can be written to Alembic by using a sample count of 5,
Shutter Open at -0.25 and Shutter Close at 0.25.

This mimics a “180 degree” shutter, opening 90 degrees before the frame
and closing 90 degrees after the frame.</dd></dd>
<dt>Selected Objects Only</dt><dd>When enabled, exports only the cted objects. When disabled, all objects are exported.</dd>
<dt>Renderable Objects Only</dt><dd>This is useful to, for examplvoid exporting custom bone shapes.</dd>
<dt>Visible Objects Only</dt><dd>Limits the export to scene collectithat are currently visible.</dd>
<dt>Flatten Hierarchy</dt><dd>When disabled, parent/child relations between objects are exported too. Any parent object that

When enabled, parent/child relations are not exported, and transformations are all written in world coordinates.</dd>
<h3>Object Options</h3>

<span class="orange">Particle Systems options.</span>
Alembic has no support for Particle Systems, in the same way that it does not support armatures.
Hair is exported as animated zero-width curves. Particles are exported as animated points.

<h2>Importing Alembic Files</h2>
When importing an Alembic file, <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/modifiers/modify/mesh_sequence_cache.html"><span class="blue">Mesh Sequence Cache modifiers</span></a>
are automatically added to time-varying meshes. For time-varying object transforms
(so animation of rotation, location, or scale)
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/animation/constraints/transform/transform_cache.html#bpy-types-transformcacheconstraint"><span class="std std-ref">Transform Cache Constraint</span></a> is used.
<h2>Custom Split Normals of Meshes</h2>

Blender supports the import and export of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/structure.html#modeling-meshes-normals-custom"><span class="std std-ref">custom normals</span></a> to
Alembic files. As a basic rule of thumb, a completely smooth mesh will be exported without normals
and thus produce the smallest Alembic file. This is reflected in the importer; an Alembic mesh
without normals is loaded as a smooth mesh.
On export, for every mesh:
If it has Custom Loop Normals then the loop normals are exported.

If one or more polygons are marked flat then loop normals are also exported.
Otherwise, no normals are exported.
On import, when the Alembic mesh contains:
Loop normals (<code><span class="sapphire">kFacevaryingScope</span></code>) are used as custom loop normals, and enable Auto Smooth to have
Blender actually use them.
Vertex normals (<code><span class="sapphire">kVertexScope</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">kVaryingScope</span></code>) are convert to loop normals, and handle as above.

If there are no normals then the mesh is marked as smooth.
Unsupported normal types (<code><span class="sapphire">kConstantScope</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">kUniformScope</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">kUnknownScope</span></code>) are handled as no normals.
When an imported mesh does not contain normals, the final look can be controlled by enabling
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/modeling/meshes/structure.html#auto-smooth"><span class="std std-ref">Auto Smooth</span></a> checkbox and altering the threshold angle.
<h2>Handling Time</h2>
Unlike Blender and many other applications and file formats, Alembic files don't have any concept of frames.

Alembic works purely with time, and values that are sampled over time. For example,
there is no way to distinguish 30 FPS with 2 samples per frame, and 60 FPS with 1 sample per frame.
This has caused many developers to just <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.blender.org/T55288#754358">hard-coded 24 FPS</a>
when reading Alembic files.
Blender uses the current scene frame rate to convert a frame number (in Blender) to a time
in seconds (in Alembic). As a result, you can import an Alembic file that was produced at 120 FPS into

a Blender scene that is 30 FPS and still not see any time stretching.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Collada</span></h2>
The COLLADA™ module has been implemented as a flexible tool for exporting and importing <code><span class="sapphire">.dae</span></code> files.
A design goal is to provide a set of parameters which should make it possible
to export/import Collada files from/to a variety of tools.
But please be aware that the Collada module is still a work in progress.

So it may be possible that your particular usage scenario is not yet supported.
<h2>Collada Exporter</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/files_import-export_collada_export.png" />
<h3>Operator Presets</h3>
There are two operator presets (see top of Operator panel) for Second Life (SL) users:
Second Life Static – is good for exporting static meshes.

Second Life Rigged – is good for exporting the SL default character.
Special Notes for Second Life users:
Please use the Operator presets. All other export settings will not work for Second Life.
The character orientation needs to be such that the character looks towards positive X.
Scale and Rotation must be applied before the export!
<h3>Export Data Options</h3>

<dt>Apply Modifiers</dt><dd>All active modifiers will be applied in a non-destructive way.
That is, the modifiers will be applied to copies of the meshes.
Thus you no longer need to apply your modifiers before exporting.
That is now done automatically in the background.
Hint
Some modifiers provide a preview mode and a render mode with different mesh settings.

The module now support both modes when applying the modifiers.
</dd>
<dt>Selection Only</dt><dd>When Selection Only is enabled, then only the selected objects will be exported.
Otherwise the entire scene is exported with all visible and all invisible objects.</dd>
<dt>Include Children</dt><dd>When this option is enabled then all children of the selected objects
will also be exported regardless of their selection state.

Hint
You now can select only an armature, then in the exporter enable
Include Children then all rigged meshes attached to the armature will also be exported.
</dd>
<dt>Include Armatures</dt><dd>When this option is enabled, then all armatures related to the selected objects
will also be exported regardless of their selection state.

Hint
You now can just select your objects, then in the exporter enable
Include Armatures then the armature data is also exported.
</dd>
<dt>Include Shape keys</dt><dd>This option also includes the application of shape keys!
So now you can export your meshes with the current shape key configuration baked in.</dd>

<h3>Texture Options</h3>
<dt>Only Selected UV Map</dt><dd>When your mesh contains multiple UV layers, then Blender exports all layers by default.
This option allows you to only export the active (selected) UV layer.</dd>
<dt>Include Textures</dt><dd>Blender supports two ways to add texturesyour objects.</dd>
<dt>Copy</dt><dd>When you export images either material based image textures,
then the exporter creates absolute file references in the export file.

But if the Copy option is enabled, the exporter will create copies of the images instead and
place the copies besides the export file. In that case the file references are made relative.</dd>
<h3>Armature Options</h3>
<dt>Deform Bones Only</dt><dd>When this option is enabled, then the exporter strips all non-deforming bones
from the exported armatures. This option is useful when your armatures contain control bones
which are not actually part of the character skeleton. For example you can now export

the Avastar rig with this option enabled. The resulting exported rig is compatible to Second Life.
But please note the restrictions further below.</dd>
<dt>Export to SL/OpenSim</dt><dd>This option is very special. In fact some issues with bone orientation are calculated
differently when this option is enabled. This is only relevant for rigged meshes.
This option might be replaced by something more meaningful in the future
(and will be still compatible to Second Life).

This option is only important when you want to export rigged meshes.
For static meshes it just does nothing at all.</dd>
<h3>Collada Options</h3>
<dt>Triangulate</dt><dd>The mesh can be triangulated on-the-fly. The triangulation is based on the same function
which is used in the Triangulate Faces tool for triangulating the current selection of faces.
For full control over the triangulation you can do this manually before exporting.

However this option allows to do the triangulation only for the exported data.
The mesh itself is not affected.</dd>
<dt>Use Object Instances</dt><dd>In Blender you can reuse the same mesh for multiple objects.
This is named “object instantiation”. When you enable this option,
then Blender will propagate object instantiation to the Collada file.</dd>
<dt>Use Blender Profile</dt><dd>Collada can be extended with tool specific data (profiles) Blender has its own (not official) profile

that allows to export rig information into the Collada file, that can later be used to reconstruct
the rig should it ever be necessary to import a dae file back into Blender.</dd>
<dt>Transformation Type</dt><dd>Collada supports two types of transformation matrix specifications.
Either as <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;Matrix&gt;</span></code> or as a set of transformation decompositions (for move, rotate and scale).
Note that the exporter will not strictly follow this option setting,
but will rather take it as a hint to use the option if ever possible.

This is so because some of the exported data types have specific rules
about how the transformation matrix has to be exported.
This is ongoing development and a less ambiguous method may be provided in the future.</dd>
<dt>Sort by Object Name</dt><dd>The export order of data is bound to internal object order and it can not be influenced in a reliable way.
This option ensures that the Geometry nodes and the Object nodes are both exported in alphabetical order.</dd>
<dt>Keep Bind Info</dt><dd>When a rig is imported to Blender, then the rig's bind pose will be used as Blender's rest pose.

So all Matrix information of the original rest pose is lost.
But in some cases you may want to preserve the original rig information.
The new option Keep Bind Info checks each bone for having two arrays:
<code><span class="sapphire">rest_mat</span></code> – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone's original rest-pose matrix.
<code><span class="sapphire">bind_mat</span></code> – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone's original bind-pose matrix.
If the arrays are present, then those arrays will be used instead of the current rest pose/bind pose.

Those two arrays are either created by a previous Collada import (see <a href="#collada-importer">Collada Importer</a> below),
or they can be created manually, or by an add-on (script based).</dd>
<h2>Collada Importer</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/files_import-export_collada_import.png" />
The Collada importer is mostly driven by the imported data.
There is one option for controlling the import units:

<dt>Import Units</dt><dd>If not enabled the imported data will be rescaled according to the currently used unit system.
If this option is enabled, then Blender will adjust itself to the unit system as provided by the Collada file.</dd>
<dt>Fix Leaf Bones</dt><dd>Collada only records “joints” which is mostly similar to Blender's bone heads.
But when you import a Collada file then the bone ends are not defined.
This does not matter for connected bones where the bone parent only has one child.
In that case the parent bone's end location is adjusted to the child's joint position.

But especially for unconnected bones and for bones with more than one child we get an issue.
When the Fix Leaf Bones option is enabled then Blender tries to guess where the bone end
of unconnected bones would best be placed. If the option is disabled,
then the bone ends are placed at an offset along the Y axis. That is why bones often point towards the Y axis.</dd>
<dt>Find Bone Chains</dt><dd>When a bone has multiple children, then it is not defined which (if any)
of the children should be connected to the bone. When the Find Bone Chains option is enabled,

then Blender determines the longest bone chain (of children) for each bone.
All bones along this chain will then be auto connected.
If the option is disabled, then children will only be connected to parents,
if the parent has only one child. But see the Auto Connect option below.</dd>
<dt>Auto Connect</dt><dd>When this option is enabled, then children will automatically
be connected to their parents, if the parent has only one child.</dd>

<dt>Keep Bind Info</dt><dd>When this option is enabled, then the importer creates two custom properties for each bone:
<code><span class="sapphire">rest_mat</span></code> – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone's original rest-pose matrix.
<code><span class="sapphire">bind_mat</span></code> – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone's original bind-pose matrix.
Those two arrays can later be used when you want to export the rig
again and be sure the original rest pose/bind pose combination must be used.</dd>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<h3>Mesh</h3>
<h4>Import</h4>
Supported geometry types are:
Tris (not tested)
Polylist
Polygons

N-gons
Tri-fans (not tested)
Lines
<h4>Export</h4>
Mesh data is exported as <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;polylist&gt;</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;lines&gt;</span></code> and <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;vertices&gt;</span></code>.
<h3>Light</h3>

<h4>Import</h4>
Blender does a best effort on importing lights from a dae-file.
If a Blender profile is detected for lights, all values from these will be used instead.
This ensures full re-import from a Blender exported dae-file. <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;extra&gt;</span></code> support has been added in Blender 2.57.
<h4>Export</h4>
A Blender profile for lights has been added through the <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;extra&gt;</span></code> tag.

The entire Light struct from Blender will be exported through this profile,
with the exception of light curve falloff.
<h3>Material &amp; Effect</h3>
<h4>Export</h4>
Since Blender 2.57 some changes to export of effects have been made.
Most notably <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;lambert&gt;</span></code> is exported if and only if specularity is 0.

<h3>Animation</h3>
<h4>Export &amp; Import</h4>
Support for object (mesh, camera, light) transform animations. Only Euler rotations,
which is the default option for Objects, can be exported for now.
For armature bone animations Euler and quaternion rotation types are supported.
Import and export of animations for the following parameters are supported:

Light
Camera
Material effects
Non-skin controlling armature bone animation.
Animations of armatures with skin deforming bones.
Animations of armatures in Object Mode.

Fully rigified armature animations (referring to the Rigify add-on). For export of rigified armature animations:
Select Bake Action. (Open <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/operator_search.html"><span class="blue">Operator Search</span></a> and type “Bake Action”.)
If you have only the deform bones selected check Only Selected.
This will give smaller dae. Otherwise uncheck Only Selected.
Check Clear Constraints.
Bake Action.

Select the mesh and the deform bones. Then export to Collada while checking only selected option.
(Selecting only the Mesh and bones is not strictly necessary.
Selecting and export only selected will give smaller dae.)
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTlmmd13J1w">Demonstration video</a>
<h3>Nodes</h3>
On import parent transformations for <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;instance_node&gt;</span></code>s is properly propagated to child node instances.

Blender materials are exported with the following mapping:
Phong
Blinn
Lambert
For bone nodes which are leaf nodes in the armature tree,
or if a bone has more than one children a Blender profile for tip with an <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;extra&gt;</span></code> tag,

is added for those joint nodes. To correctly derive the bone-to-tail location on re-import.
Note
Important Things to Remember
Object and data-block names are constrained to 21 characters (bytes).
UV layer names are constrained to 32 characters (bytes).
Only armature animation on mesh, single skin controller.

No support for modifiers yet.
When importing a dae-file that has <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;instance_node&gt;</span></code> on exporting
this information is essentially lost and these nodes will be <code><span class="sapphire">&lt;node&gt;</span></code>s.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Universal Scene Description</span></h2>
Universal Scene Description (USD) files can contain complex layering, overriding,
and references to other files. Blender's USD Exporter takes a much simpler approach.

When exporting, all visible, supported objects in the scene are exported, optionally limited by their selection state.
Blender does not (yet) support exporting invisible objects, USD layers, variants, skeletal animation, etc.
The following objects can be exported to USD:
Meshes (of different kinds, see below).
Cameras (perspective cameras only at the moment, not orthogonal ones).
Light (all types except area lights).

Hair (exported as curves, and limited to parent strands).
When exporting an animation, the final, evaluated mesh is written to USD.
This means that the following meshes can be exported:
Static meshes.
Deforming meshes; here the topology of the mesh does not change,
but the locations of the vertices change over time. Examples are animated characters or

bouncing (but not cracking) objects.
Arbitrarily animated meshes; here the topology does change.
An example is the result of a fluid simulation, where splashes of fluid can break off the main body.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/files_import-export_usd_example.png" />
<span class="orange">Shot from <a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.blender.org/p/spring/">Spring</a> exported to USD and opened in USDView.</span>
<h2>Export Options</h2>

The following options are available when exporting to USD:
<dt>Selection Only</dt><dd>When checked, only selected objects are exported.
Duplicated objects, for example collections that are instanced in the scene,
are considered ‘selected' when their duplicator is selected.</dd>
<dt>Animation</dt><dd>When checked, the entire scene frame range is exported.
When unchecked, only the current scene frame is exported.</dd>

<dt>Hair</dt><dd>When checked, parent hair strands are exported as a curve system.
Hair strand colors are not exported.</dd>
<dt>UV Maps</dt><dd>When checked, includes UV coordinates for exported meshes.
The name of the UV map in USD is the same as the name in Blender.
In USD the default name is <code><span class="sapphire">st</span></code> whereas in Blender the default name is <code><span class="sapphire">UVMap</span></code>.
To export to the standard UV map name <code><span class="sapphire">st</span></code>, rename the UV map in Blender to <code><span class="sapphire">st</span></code>.</dd>

<dt>Normals</dt><dd>When checked, includes normals for exported meshThis includes custom loop normals.</dd>
<dt>Materials</dt><dd>When checked, exports the viewport materials of meshes.
When a mesh has multiple materials assigned, a geometry subset is created for each material.
The first material (if any) is always applied to the mesh itself as well
(regardless of the existence of geometry subsets),
because the Hydra viewport does not support materials on subsets.

See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/542">USD issue #542</a>
for more information.</dd>
<dt>Use Settings for</dt><dd>Determines the whether to use Viewport or Render visibility of collection, modifiers,
or any other property that can be set for both the Viewport and Render.</dd>
<h3>Experimental</h3>
<dt>Instancing</dt><dd>As this is an experimental option. When unchecked,

duplicated objects are exported as real objects, so a particle system with
100 particles that is displayed with 100 meshes will have 100 individual meshes
in the exported file. When checked, duplicated objects are exported as
a reference to the original object. If the original object is not part of the export,
the first duplicate is exported as real object and used as reference.</dd>
<h2>Limitations</h2>

<dt>Single-sided and Double-sided Meshes</dt><dd>USD seems to support neither per-material nor per-face-group double-sidedness,
so Blender uses the flag from the first material to mark the entire mesh as single/double-sided.
If there is no material it defaults to double-sided.</dd>
<dt>Mesh Normals</dt><dd>The mesh subdivision scheme in USD is ‘Catmull-Clark' by default,
but Blender uses ‘None' instead, indicating that a polygonal mesh is exported.
This is necessary for USD to understand the custom normals;

otherwise the mesh is always rendered smooth.</dd>
<dt>Vertex Velocities</dt><dd>Currently only fluid simulations (not meshes in general) have explicit vertex velocities.
This is the most important case for exporting velocities, though,
as the baked mesh changes topology all the time, and
thus computing the velocities at import time in a post-processing step is hard.</dd>
<dt>Coordinate System Orientation</dt><dd>Blender uses the Z axis as up axis. Since USD supports both Y up and Z up,

the USD files written by Blender always use Z up.</dd>
<dt>Materials</dt><dd>Very simple versions of the materials are exported, using only
the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/materials/settings.html#render-materials-settings-viewport-display"><span class="std std-ref">Viewport Display</span></a> color, metallic, and roughness.
When there are multiple materials, the mesh faces are stored as geometry subset
and each material is assigned to the appropriate subset.
If there is only one material this is skipped. Note that the geometry subsets are not time-sampled,

so it may break when an animated mesh changes topology.</dd>
<dt>Hair</dt><dd>Only the parent strands are exported, and only with a constant color.
No UV coordinates, and no information about the normals.</dd>
<dt>Camera</dt><dd>Only perspective cameras are exported.</dd>
<dt>Lights</dt><dd>USD does not directly support spot lights, so those not exported.</dd>
<dt>Particles</dt><dd>Particles are only written when they are alive, which means that they are always visible.

There is currently no code that deals with marking them as invisible outside their lifespan.
Objects instanced by particle system are exported by suffixing the object name with
the particle's persistent ID, giving each particle transform a unique name.</dd>
<dt>Instancing/Referencing</dt><dd>This is still an experimental feature that can be enabled when exporting to USD.
When enabled, instanced object meshes are written to USD as references to the original mesh.
The first copy of the mesh is written for real, and the following copies are referencing the first.

Which mesh is considered ‘the first' is chosen more or less arbitrarily.</dd>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Startup</span></h2>
<h2>Blender</h2>
There are some common causes for problems when using Blender. If you cannot find a solution to your problem here,
try asking the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/getting_started/about/community.html"><span class="blue">community</span></a> for help.
If Blender crashes on startup, there are a few things to check for:
See if your computer meets the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/">minimum requirements</a>.

Confirm that your graphics card is supported and that the drivers are up to date.
Make sure you are using the correct Blender version (32 or 64 bit) for your architecture.
Known causes listed below.
<h2>Common Startup Messages</h2>
The Blender Console Window can display many different types of status and error messages.
Some messages simply inform the user what Blender is doing, but have no real impact on Blender's ability to function.

Other messages can indicate serious errors that will most likely prevent Blender carrying out a particular task and
may even make Blender non-responsive or shut down completely. The Blender Console Window messages can
also originate internally from within the Blender code or from external sources such as
<a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/addons.html"><span class="blue">Python scripts</span></a>.

To avoid this:
Increase the near clipping when working on large scenes.
Decrease the far clipping when objects are not viewed at a distance.
When perspective is disabled only the far Clip End is used, very high values can still give artifacts.
This is not specific to Blender, all OpenGL/DirectX graphics applications have these same limitations.

<h3>Objects Invisible in Camera View</h3>
If you have a large scene, viewing it through Camera View may not display all of the objects in the scene.
One possibility may be that the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/render/cameras.html#camera-clipping"><span class="std std-ref">clipping distance</span></a> of the camera is too low.
The camera will only show objects that fall within the clipping range.
<h2>Performance</h2>
<h3>Slow Rendering</h3>

There are a couple of reasons why you may be experiencing a slow viewport.
<dt>Old Hardware</dt><dd>Sometimes your hardware, mainly your graphiard, may be too slow to keep up with your model.</dd>
<dt>Upgrade Graphics Driver</dt><dd>In some cases, slow selection is lved by using updated drivers.</dd>
<h3>Slow Selection</h3>
Blender uses OpenGL for selection, some graphics card drivers are slow at performing this operation.
This becomes especially problematic on dense geometry.

Possible Solutions:
<dt>OpenGL Depth Picking (Preferences)</dt><dd>See <span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ Viewport ‣ Selection</span>.
This option is enabled by default, disabling it may give a better performance at
the cost of selection accuracy.</dd>
<dt>Upgrade Graphics Driver</dt><dd>In some cases, slow selection is resolved by using updated drivers.
It is generally good to use recent drivers when using 3D software.</dd>

<dt>Select Centers (Workaround)</dt><dd>In Object Mode, holding <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> while selecting uses the object center point.
While this can be useful on its own, it has the side effect of not relying on OpenGL selection.</dd>
<dt>Change Display Mode (Workaround)</dt><dd>Using Wireframeplay mode can be used to more quickly select different objects.</dd>
Note
Obviously, the workarounds listed here are not long term solutions,
but it is handy to know if you are stuck using a system with poor OpenGL support.

Ultimately, if none of these options work out it may be worth upgrading your hardware.
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<h3>Lost in Space</h3>
When navigating your scene, you may accidentally navigate away from your scene
and find yourself with a blank viewport. There are two ways to fix this:
Select an object in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/outliner.html"><span class="blue">Outliner</span></a>,

then zoom to that object with <span class="saddlebrown">View ‣ Frame Selected</span> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">NumpadPeriod</kbd>.
Use <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Home</kbd> to fit all objects into the 3D View.
<h3>Invisible Limit Zooming In</h3>
Sometimes when navigating you may be trying to zoom in but it seems that you have hit a limit
to how far you can zoom.
This is because Blender uses a central point to orbit around.

In practice this is good for modeling an object which you rotate about a lot to see from all sides
(think of a potter using a wheel).
However, this makes it awkward to explore a scene or model an object from the ‘inside', for example.
<h4>Solutions</h4>
Use <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/navigate/navigation.html#dview-nav-zoom-dolly"><span class="std std-ref">View Dolly</span></a>.
Use <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/navigate/walk_fly.html#dview-fly-walk"><span class="std std-ref">Walk/Fly modes</span></a>.

Use <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/navigation.html#prefs-auto-depth"><span class="std std-ref">Auto Depth</span></a> and <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/navigation.html#prefs-zoom-mouse-pos"><span class="std std-ref">Zoom to Mouse Position</span></a>.
These tools will make sure the distance is always the value under the mouse cursor,
Use <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/3dview/navigate/navigation.html#dview-nav-zoom-region"><span class="std std-ref">Zoom Region</span></a> as it also resets the center point when zooming.
Center the view around the mouse cursor <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-MMB</kbd>.
This will take the position under the cursor and make it your viewpoint center.
Use an <abbr title="N-Degrees of Freedom">NDOF</abbr>, also known as a 3D mouse,

see <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/getting_started/configuration/hardware.html#hardware-ndof"><span class="std std-ref">configuring peripherals</span></a> for more information.
<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>Invalid Selection</h3>
There are times when selection fails under some configurations,
often this is noticeable in mesh Edit Mode,
selecting vertices/edges/faces where random elements are selected.

Internally Blender uses <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-opengl"><span class="xref std std-term">OpenGL</span></a> for selection,
so the graphics card driver relies on giving correct results.
Possible Solutions:
<dt>Disable Anti-Aliasing <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/glossary/index.html#term-multisampling"><span class="xref std std-term">Multisampling</span></a></dt><dd>This is by far the most common cause of selection issues.
There are known problems with some graphics cards when using multisampling.
You can disable this option by:

Turning multisampling off in your graphics card driver options.
Turning Multisampling off in the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/viewport.html#prefs-system-multisampling"><span class="std std-ref">System Preferences</span></a>.
</dd>
<dt>Change Anti-Aliasing Sample Settings</dt><dd>Depending on your OpenGL configuration,
some specific sample settings may work while others fail.
Unfortunately finding working configuration involves trial &amp; error testing.</dd>

<dt>Upgrade Graphics Driver</dt><dd>As with any OpenGL-related issues, using recent drivers can resolve problems.
However, it should be noted that this is a fairly common problem and remains unresolved with many drivers.</dd>
<h2><span class="greenbut">Graphics Hardware</span></h2>
Blender uses of OpenGL for the 3D Viewport and user interface.
The graphics card (GPU) and driver have a big impact on Blender's behavior and performance.
This section lists possible solutions for graphics glitches, problems with Eevee and Cycles,

and crashes related to your GPU.
<h2>Drivers</h2>
Upgrading to the latest graphics drivers often solves problems.
Newer drivers have bug fixes that help Blender function correctly.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Crashes</span></h2>
The most common causes of Blender crashes:
Running out of memory.
Issues with graphics hardware or drivers.
Bugs in Blender.

Firstly, you may be able to recover your work with <span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ Recover ‣ Auto Save…</span>.
To prevent the problem from happening again, you can check that the graphics drivers are up to date, upgrade your
machine's hardware (the RAM or graphics card), and disable some options that are more memory intensive:
Reduce undo steps
<span class="saddlebrown">Preferences ‣ System ‣ Memory &amp; Limits ‣ Undo Steps</span>.
Using multisample anti-aliasing also increases the memory usage and makes the display slower.

On Linux, the Window Manager (KDE, Gnome, Unity) may be using hardware accelerated effects
(e.g. window shadows and transparency) that are using up the memory that Blender needs.
Try disabling the desktop effects or switch to a lightweight Window Manager.
<h2>Crash Log</h2>
When Blender crashes, it writes out a text file
which contains information that may help identify the cause of the crash.

On a crash, a file is written based on the name of the currently loaded blend-file,
so <code><span class="sapphire">test.blend</span></code> will create a file called <code><span class="sapphire">test.crash.txt</span></code>.
The crash log for unsaved files will be written into the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html#temp-dir"><span class="std std-ref">Temporary Directory</span></a> directory.
This file contains a log of tools used up until the crash as well as some other debug information.
When reporting bugs on crashes it can be helpful to attach this file to your reports,
especially when others are unable to reproduce the crash.

Warning
This is currently disabled for Windows.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Python Errors</span></h2>
<h2>Precompiled Libraries</h2>
While not common practice, Python add-ons can be distributed with their own precompiled libraries.
Unlike regular Python scripts, these are not portable between different platforms.

It is possible the library is incompatible with your Blender installation
(attempting to load a library built for a different version of Python,
or loading a 32-bit library on a 64-bit system).
If the add-on contains <code><span class="sapphire">.pyd</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">.so</span></code> files,
check that the distribution is compatible with your operating system.
<h2>Platform Specific</h2>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<h4>Mixed Python Libraries (DLL's)</h4>
If Python is raising errors or you have an add-on that just fails when enabled with an error, e.g:
<code><span class="sapphire">...</span> <span class="sapphire">is</span> <span class="sapphire">not</span> <span class="sapphire">a</span> <span class="sapphire">valid</span> <span class="sapphire">Win32</span> <span class="sapphire">application.</span></code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/troubleshooting_python_traceback.png" />
<span class="orange">A Python traceback.</span>

This may be caused by some inconsistency in the Python libraries.
While Blender comes with its own bundled Python interpreter, duplicate, incompatible libraries can cause problems.
To find out which Python Library caused the Problem check the error message.
This is normally reported somewhere around the bottom line of the traceback.
With the error above you see the problem is caused while trying to import <code><span class="sapphire">_socket</span></code>.
This corresponds to either a file named <code><span class="sapphire">_socket.py</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">_socket.pyd</span></code>.

To help troubleshoot this problem,
the following script can be pasted into the Text editor and run to check for duplicate libraries in your search path.

<h2><span class="greenbut">Recovering Data</span></h2>
Computer crashes, power outages, or simply forgetting to save can result in
the loss or corruption of your work. You can use Blender's Auto Save feature
to reduce the chance of losing files when such events occur.

There are options to save a backup of your files like
Auto Save that saves your file automatically over time, and Save on Quit,
which saves your blend-file automatically when you exit Blender.
In addition to these functions being enabled by default,
the Save on Quit functionality cannot be disabled.
Note

For your actions, there are options like Undo, Redo and an Undo History,
used to roll back from mistakes under normal operation, or return back to a specific action.
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/undo_redo.html"><span class="blue">Undo &amp; Redo</span></a>.
The File tab of the Preferences allows you to configure the two ways
that Blender provides for you to regress to a previous version of your work.
See <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/save_load.html#prefs-auto-save"><span class="std std-ref">Auto Save Preferences</span></a> for details.

<h2>Recovering Auto Saves</h2>

<dt class="field-even">Menu</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ Recover ‣ Auto Save…</span></dd>

<h3>Recover Last Session</h3>
The Recover Last Session will open the <code><span class="sapphire">quit.blend</span></code> file
that is saved into the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html#temp-dir"><span class="std std-ref">Temporary Directory</span></a> when you quit Blender under normal operation.
Note that files in your temporary directory may be deleted when you reboot your computer
(depending on your system configuration).
<h3>Recover Auto Save</h3>

The Recover Auto Save allows you to open the Auto Saved file.
You will have to navigate to your <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html#temp-dir"><span class="std std-ref">Temporary Directory</span></a>.
The Auto Saved files are named using a random number and have a blend extension.
It is important, when browsing, to enable the detailed list view.
Otherwise, you will not be able to figure out the dates of the auto-saved blend-files.
See Fig. <a href="#fig-troubleshooting-file-browser"><span class="std std-ref">File Browser with detailed view selected.</span></a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/_images/troubleshooting_recover_display-file-date.png" />
<span class="orange">File Browser with detailed view selected.</span>
Warning
When recovering an Auto Saved file, you will lose any changes made
since the last Auto Save was performed.
Only one Auto Saved file exists for each project,

i.e. Blender does not keep older versions.
Hence, you will not be able to go back more than a few minutes with this tool.

<h2>Application Templates</h2>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Application templates are a feature that allows you to define a re-usable configuration

that can be selected to replace the default configuration,
without requiring a separate Blender installation or overwriting your personal settings.
Application templates can be selected from the splash screen or <span class="saddlebrown">File ‣ New</span> sub-menu.
When there are no templates found the menu will not be displayed on the splash screen.
New application templates can be installed from the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/window_system/topbar.html#topbar-app-menu"><span class="std std-ref">App Menu</span></a>.
If you would like to keep the current application template active on restarting Blender, save your preferences.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
In some cases it's not enough to write a single script or add-on,
and expect someone to replace their preferences and startup file, install scripts and change their keymap.
The goal of application templates is to support switching to a customized configuration
without disrupting your existing settings and installation.
This means people can build their own applications on top of Blender that can be easily distributed.

<h3>Details</h3>
An application template may define its own:
<dt>Startup File</dt><dd>The default file to load with this template.</dd>
<dt>Preferences</dt><dd>Only certain preferences from a template are used:
Themes.
Add-ons.

Keymaps.
Viewport lighting.
</dd>
<dt>Splash Screen</dt><dd>Templates may provide their own splash scremage.</dd>
<dt>Python Scripts</dt><dd>While templates have access to the same functionality as any other scripts,
typical operations include:

Modifying and replacing parts of the user interface.
Defining new menus, keymaps and tools.
Defining a custom add-on path for template specific add-ons.
</dd>
Templates also have their own user configuration, so saving a startup file while using a template
won't overwrite your default startup file.

<h3>Directory Layout</h3>
Templates may be located in one of two locations within the <code><span class="sapphire">scripts</span></code> directory.
<dt>Template locations:</dt><dd>
<code><span class="sapphire">{BLENDER_USER_SCRIPTS}/startup/bl_app_templates_user</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">{BLENDER_SYSTEM_SCRIPTS}/startup/bl_app_templates_system</span></code>
</dd>

User configuration is stored in a subdirectory:
<dt>Without a template:</dt><dd>
<code><span class="sapphire">./config/startup.blend</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">./config/userpref.blend</span></code>
</dd>
<dt>With a template:</dt><dd>

<code><span class="sapphire">./config/{APP_TEMPLATE_ID}/startup.blend</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">./config/{APP_TEMPLATE_ID}/userpref.blend</span></code>
</dd>
See <a href="blender_directory_layout.html#blender-directory-layout"><span class="std std-ref">Blender's Directory Layout</span></a> for details on script and configuration locations.
<h3>Command Line Access</h3>
Using the <a href="command_line/arguments.html#command-line-args"><span class="std std-ref">command-line arguments</span></a> you can setup a launcher

that opens Blender with a specific app template:
<span></span>blender --app-template my_template
</pre>
<h2>Template Contents</h2>
Each of the following files can be used for application templates but are optional.
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">startup.blend</span></code></dt><dd>Factory startup file to use for this template.</dd>

<dt><code><span class="sapphire">userpref.blend</span></code></dt><dd>Factory preferences file to use for this template.
When omitted preferences are shared with the default Blender configuration.
(As noted previously, this is only used for a subset of preferences).</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">splash.png</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">splash_2x.png</span></code></dt><dd>Splash screen to override Blender's default artwork (not including header text).
Must be <code><span class="sapphire">501x250</span></code> and <code><span class="sapphire">1002x500</span></code> (used for HiDPI monitors).</dd>
<dt><code><span class="sapphire">__init__.py</span></code></dt><dd>A Python script which must contain <code><span class="sapphire">register</span></code> and <code><span class="sapphire">unregister</span></code> functions.</dd>

Note
Bundled blend-files <code><span class="sapphire">startup.blend</span></code> and <code><span class="sapphire">userpref.blend</span></code> are considered Factory Settings
and are never overwritten.
The user may save their own startup/preferences while using this template
which will be stored in their user configuration.
The original template settings can be loaded using: Load Template Factory Settings

from the file menu in much the same way Load Factory Settings works.
<h2>Template Scripts</h2>
While app templates can use Python scripts,
they simply have access to the same API's available for add-ons and any other scripts.
As noted above, you may optionally have an <code><span class="sapphire">__init__.py</span></code> in your app template.
This has the following advantages:

Changes can be made to the startup or preferences, without having to distribute a blend-file.
Changes can be made dynamically.
You could for example – configure the template to check the number of processors, operating system and memory,
then set values based on this.
You may enable add-ons associated with your template.
On activation a <code><span class="sapphire">register</span></code> function is called, <code><span class="sapphire">unregister</span></code> is called when another template is selected.

As these only run once, any changes to defaults must be made via handler.
Two handlers you're likely to use are:
<code><span class="sapphire">bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_preferences_post</span></code>
<code><span class="sapphire">bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_startup_post</span></code>
These allow you to define your own “factory settings”, which the user may change,
just as Blender has it's own defaults when first launched.

This is an example <code><span class="sapphire">__init__.py</span></code> file which defines defaults for an app template to use.
<span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bpy</span>

<h2><span class="greenbut">Keymap Customization</span></h2>
<h2>Keys</h2>

<h3>Available Keys</h3>
When customizing keymaps it's useful to use keys which won't conflict with Blender's default keymap.
Here are keys which aren't used and aren't likely to be used in the future.
<dt>F-Keys (<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">F5</kbd> - <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">F8</kbd>)</dt><dd>These F-keys (including modifier combination)
have been intentionally kept free for users to bind their own keys to.</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">OSKey</kbd> (also known as the <code><span class="sapphire">Windows-Key</span></code>, <code><span class="sapphire">Cmd</span></code> or <code><span class="sapphire">Super</span></code>)</dt><dd>Blender doesn't use this key for any bindings.

macOS is an exception, where <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Cmd</kbd> replaces <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>
except in cases it would conflict with the system's key bindings.</dd>
<dt>Modifier Double Click</dt><dd>Binding modifier keys as primary keys is supported,
to avoid conflicts with regular usage you can bind them to double click.</dd>
<h3>Multi-Action Keys</h3>
<h4>Click/Drag</h4>

It's possible to configure a single key to perform multiple operations
using Click event instead of Press. Then you may bind Drag to a separate action.
This is useful for mixing actions where one uses a drag event, e.g:
Toggle a setting using with tab, drag to open a pie menu showing all options related to the setting.
<h4>Click/Tweak</h4>
Unlike click/drag, this only works for the mouse buttons,

but has the advantage that tweak events can be directional.
To use this, events in this keymap must use Click instead of Press,
then you can bind Tweak actions to the mouse buttons.
This is used in the default keymap in the 3D Viewport,
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt-MMB</kbd> dragging in different directions rotates the view.
<h2>Common Operations</h2>

This section lists useful generic operations which can be used.
<h3>Key Bindings for Pop-Ups</h3>
Menus and panels can be assigned key shortcuts,
even if they're only accessible from sub-menus elsewhere.
<dt>Open a Pop-up Menu (<code><span class="sapphire">wm.call_menu</span></code>)</dt><dd>Open any menu on key press.</dd>
<dt>Open a Pie Menu (<code><span class="sapphire">wm.call_menu_pie</span></code>)</dt><dd>Open any pie menu on key s.</dd>

<dt>Open a Panel (<code><span class="sapphire">wm.call_panel</span></code>)</dt><dd>Open a pop-up panel (also knas a pop-over).</dd>
<h4>Menu &amp; Panel Identifiers</h4>
To find the <code><span class="sapphire">name</span></code> of a menu,
enable the preference <span class="saddlebrown">Interface ‣ Display ‣ Python Tooltips</span>.
Then hover the cursor over the popover button or menu item,
for sub-menus you will need to use the back arrow to prevent the sub-menu from opening and gaining focus.

<h3>Key Bindings for Properties</h3>
There are many properties you might want to bind a key with.
To avoid having to define operators for each property,
there are generic operators for this purpose:
Operators for adjusting properties begin with <code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_</span></code>.
Some of these include:

<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_toggle</span></code> toggle a boolean property.
<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_cycle_enum</span></code> cycle an <abbr title="enumeration">enum</abbr> property forwards or backwards.
<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_menu_enum</span></code> show a pop-up menu for an enum property.
<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_pie_enum</span></code> show a pie menu for an enum property.
<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_scale_float</span></code> scale a number (used for increasing / decreasing brush size for example).
<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_toggle_enum</span></code> toggle between two options of an enum.

<code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_modal_mouse</span></code> moving the cursor to interactively change a value.
See <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.wm.html">bpy.ops.wm</a> for a complete list.
Each of these operators has a <code><span class="sapphire">data_path</span></code> setting to reference the property to change.
To find the <code><span class="sapphire">data_path</span></code>, basic Python knowledge is needed.
For example, you can use the Python Console to access a boolean property you wish to map to a key:
<span></span><span class="n">bpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">show_name</span>

</pre>
To bind this to a key, add a new keymap item using the operator <code><span class="sapphire">wm.context_toggle</span></code>
with <code><span class="sapphire">data_path</span></code> set to <code><span class="sapphire">object.show_name</span></code> (notice the <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.context</span></code> prefix is implicit).
See <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.context.html">bpy.context</a>
for other context attributes.
The Python API documentation can be used to find properties

or you may use the Python Console's auto-complete to inspect available properties.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Working Limits</span></h2>
<h2>Space</h2>
While object positions, vertex locations are not clamped, larger values become increasingly imprecise.
To get an idea of the precision you can work with using different scales.
Here's a table of scales and their associated accuracy.

<dt class="field-odd">10</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">1/1,048,576<sup>th</sup></dd>
<dt class="field-even">100</dt>
<dd class="field-even">1/131,072<sup>th</sup></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">1,000</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">1/16,384<sup>th</sup></dd>

<dt class="field-even">10,000</dt>
<dd class="field-even">1/1,024<sup>th</sup></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">100,000</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">1/128<sup>th</sup></dd>
<dt class="field-even">1,000,000</dt>
<dd class="field-even">1/16<sup>th</sup></dd>

Hint
For a rough rule of thumb, values within -5,000/+5,000 are typically reliable (range of 10,000).
Internally single precision floating point calculations are used.
<h2>Time</h2>
The maximum number of frames for each scene is currently 1,048,574, and allows for continuous shots for durations of:
<dt class="field-odd">24 fps</dt>

<dd class="field-odd">12 hours, 8 minutes.</dd>
<dt class="field-even">25 fps</dt>
<dd class="field-even">11 hours, 39 minutes.</dd>
<dt class="field-odd">30 fps</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">9 hours, 42 minutes.</dd>
<dt class="field-even">60 fps</dt>

<dd class="field-even">4 hours, 51 minutes.</dd>
Note
In practice, a finished work is typically composed of output from many scenes.
So this limit does not prevent you from creating longer works.
<h2>Text Fields</h2>
Fixed strings are used internally, and while it is not useful to list all limits, here are some common limits.

<dt class="field-odd">directory</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">767</dd>
<dt class="field-even">file-name</dt>
<dd class="field-even">255</dd>
<dt class="field-odd">file-path</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">1023</dd>

<dt class="field-even">identifier</dt>
<dd class="field-even">63</dd>
Used for data-block names, modifiers, vertex groups, UV layers…
Note
Multi-byte encoding means some Unicode characters use more than a single ASCII character.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Operators</span></h2>

<h2>Debug Menu</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Mode</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">All Modes</dd>
<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-D</kbd></dd>

This operator brings up a menu to set Blender into a certain debug mode.
See the
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/B/browse/master/source/blender/blenkernel/BKE_global.h">source code</a>
for a description of what each value does.
Tip
Developers can search the code for <code><span class="sapphire">G.debug_value</span></code> to find other possible uses for this operator.

Note
Additional debug options are available by launching Blender in debug mode or setting <code><span class="sapphire">bpy.app.debug</span> <span class="sapphire">=</span> <span class="sapphire">True</span></code>.
<h2>Redraw Timer</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Mode</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">All Modes</dd>

<dt class="field-even">Hotkey</dt>
<dd class="field-even"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-Alt-T</kbd></dd>
This operator brings up a menu with a list of tests to benchmark UI render times along with undo/redo functions.
<h2>Memory Statistics</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Mode</dt>

<dd class="field-odd"><code><span class="sapphire">--debug-memory</span></code></dd>
This operator which can be found by searching “Memory Statistics” from
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/operator_search.html"><span class="blue">Operator Search</span></a>
will print useful information about memory objects, their size and user count.
Important
To fully use this operator run Blender from the console with <code><span class="sapphire">--debug-memory</span></code>.

<h2>Dependency Relations</h2>
Reference
<dt class="field-odd">Mode</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><code><span class="sapphire">--debug-depsgraph</span></code></dd>
This operator which can be found by searching “Dependency Relations” from
the <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/interface/controls/templates/operator_search.html"><span class="blue">Operator Search</span></a>

will print the relations for every scene and object in the blend-file.
Important
This operator will only work if Blender is started from the console with <code><span class="sapphire">--debug-depsgraph</span></code>.
<h2><span class="greenbut">Blender's Directory Layout</span></h2>
This page documents the different directories used by Blender
(which can be helpful for troubleshooting).

There are three different directories Blender may use,
their exact locations are platform dependent.
<dt class="field-odd">LOCAL</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">Location of configuration and run-time data (for self-contained bundle).</dd>
<dt class="field-even">USER</dt>
<dd class="field-even">Location of configuration files (typically in the user's home directory).</dd>

<dt class="field-odd">SYSTEM</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">Location of run-time data for system wide installation (may be read-only).</dd>
For system installations both SYSTEM and USER directories are needed.
For locally extracted Blender distributions, the user configuration and run-time data are
kept in the same subdirectory, allowing multiple Blender versions to run without conflict,
ignoring the USER and SYSTEM files.

This requires you to create a folder named <code><span class="sapphire">config</span></code> in the LOCAL directory.
<h2>Platform Dependent Paths</h2>
Here are the default locations for each system:
<h3>Linux</h3>
<dt class="field-odd">LOCAL</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">./2.82/</pre></dd>

<dt class="field-even">USER</dt>
<dd class="field-even">$HOME/.config/blender/2.82/</pre></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">SYSTEM</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">/usr/share/blender/2.82/</pre></dd>
Note
The path ./2.82/ is relative to the Blender executable and

is used for self-contained bundles distributed by official blender.org builds.
Note
The USER path will use <code><span class="sapphire">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</span></code> if it is set:
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/blender/2.82/</pre>
<h3>macOS</h3>
<dt class="field-odd">LOCAL</dt>

<dd class="field-odd">./2.82/</pre></dd>
<dt class="field-even">USER</dt>
<dd class="field-even">/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/2.82/</pre></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">SYSTEM</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">/Library/Application Support/Blender/2.82/</pre></dd>
Note

macOS stores the Blender binary in <code><span class="sapphire">./Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender</span></code>.
The local path to data and config is:
./Blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.82/</pre>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<dt class="field-odd">LOCAL</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">.\2.82\</pre></dd>

<dt class="field-even">USER</dt>
<dd class="field-even">%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.82\</pre></dd>
<dt class="field-odd">SYSTEM</dt>
<dd class="field-odd">%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.82\</pre></dd>

<h2>Temporary Directory</h2>
The temporary directory is used to store various files at run-time
(including render layers, physics cache, copy-paste buffer and crash logs).
The temporary directory is selected based on the following priority:
User Preference (see <a href=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.82/editors/preferences/file_paths.html#prefs-file-paths"><span class="std std-ref">File Paths</span></a>).
Environment variables (<code><span class="sapphire">TEMP</span></code> on Windows, <code><span class="sapphire">TMP</span></code> &amp; <code><span class="sapphire">TMP_DIR</span></code> on other platforms).

<em>Update note</em>: Eric Van de Kerckhove updated this tutorial for Blender 2.9. 
Vicki Wenderlich wrote the original.
Imagine you’re a game developer getting ready to make a 3D game. 

You’ve come up with some cool ideas and prepared some sound effects, everything is right in the world. 
That is, until you realize you have no clue how to create 3D models!
Don’t feel bad though, you’re not alone. 
In this situation, you have some options:
Cry
Decide that a 2D game isn’t that bad after all

Find free 3D models online
Pay an artist to make some for you
Create your own!
If you’ve never touched Blender before but want to be able to make some simple objects for use in your game, look no further – this tutorial is for you! Blender is a hugely popular free and open source 3D creation suite. 
Its main feature set includes 3D modeling, rigging, animating, simulating and rendering. 
Since version 2.8, Blender has become more streamlined and easier to use than ever. 

It’s now a perfect candidate for beginners delving into the world of 3D modeling!
In this Blender tutorial for beginners, you’ll learn the basic setup of Blender by creating a cute creature you will recognize from the 8-bit days. 
:]
This tutorial will only scratch the surface of what Blender can do, the stuff you need to know to get started making objects and using them in your games. 
At the end of this tutorial you’ll learn how to:
Download and install Blender

Navigate around the application
Add and transform objects in Object Mode
Edit objects in Edit Mode
Unwrap an object’s UV map
Create and use textures
Exporting your files to common 3D formats

<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-1"><span class="orange">Getting Started</span></h3>
If you don’t have Blender installed on your computer, <a href="http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download the latest version here</a>. 
This tutorial uses Blender 2.92, but with any version of Blender from 2.8 onward you’ll be able to follow along just fine.
Like other 3D modeling tools, Blender is a graphically intensive application; check out the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">system requirements</a> before installing to make sure your rig will run Blender without any hiccups.
Once you have Blender installed, launch it and you’ll be greeted by a splash screen. 
Click anywhere outside of the splash screen to get started.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlenderSplashScreen.png">
You now see the default scene that contains a cube, a camera and a light, as illustrated in the screenshot below:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlenderDefaultScene.png">
<em>Note:</em> Don’t see the elements above? Simply select <em>File ► New ► General</em> to generate a default scene.
These objects are located in the <em>3D view</em>. 
You can orient yourself in the 3D space using the X, Y and Z axes:

The X-axis is red and moves from left to right.
The Y-axis is green and moves from front to back.
The Z-axis is blue and moves from top to bottom.
To visualize this, Blender has a gizmo at the top right that acts like a 3D compass and colored lines on the grid.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlenderAxes.gif">
There are five regions on the screen that you’ll use to create your 3D objects:

<em>Outliner</em>: Lists all objects in your scene.
<em>Properties</em>: Allows you to edit the properties of the selected scene and object.
<em>3D View</em>: Contains a 3D visualization of the objects in the scene.
<em>3D View Header</em>: A top menu with a collection of context-aware functions.
<em>Toolbar</em>: Displays relevant tools for the mode you’re in.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlenderLayout.png">

Now that you know where to look, it’s time to cover a few more concepts that you’ll need before creating your first 3D model. 
Hang on tight!
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-2"><span class="orange">Controlling Your View</span></h3>
Navigating around your 3D view is something you’ll be doing frequently, so you should get really comfortable with the navigational controls.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-3"> Navigating In a 3D Space</h3>
The primary ways to manipulate your view are as follows:

<em>To rotate around</em>: hold the middle mouse button and drag around.
<em>To zoom in and out</em>: Scroll up and down.
<em>To pan the view</em>: Hold down Shift and the mouse scroll wheel, then drag around.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlenderViewControl.gif">
If you ever lose your way in the 3D view, press <em>Period</em> (.) on your numpad, this will snap your view back to the selected object.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-4"> Orthographic And Perspective Projection</h3>

There are two ways of projecting 3D objects on a 2D plane like your computer screen:
<em>Perspective</em> : Objects further away in your view appear smaller, and lines on your objects display perspective distortion. 
This is how we perceive things with our eyes in real life.
<em>Orthographic</em>: Objects are drawn linearly without any perspective distortion. 
This is more common for technical drawings and isometric games like <i>SimCity</i> and <i>Diablo</i> .
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlenderPerspectiveVSOrthographic.gif">

Although objects look more natural with a perspective projection, it’s easier to design your models using the orthographic projection where you can view and edit objects on a flat plane without any distortions caused by distance.
Perspective is the default projection for new scenes. 
To switch between projections, click on the projection toggle button at the top right of the 3D view. 
It looks like a grid:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ToggleProjectionButton.png">
Alternatively, press <em>5</em> on your numpad to do the same.

<em>Note:</em> Blender is all about knowing the right shortcuts to do what you want efficiently. 
Just about every common function has a dedicated shortcut. 
If there’s a button or menu option you often use, try hovering over it for a second and you’ll see a description and the assigned shortcut.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/HoverOverProjectionButton.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-5"><span class="orange">Customizing The Regions</span></h3>
To resize a region, simply mouse over the edge until your cursor changes to a resize icon and drag to change expand or shrink the region:

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ResizingRegion.gif">
To create another region, click and drag the black corner at the top right or bottom left of the current region inwards. 
To merge it with an existing region, do the same but drag the corner outwards to another region. 
Here’s a demonstration:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/AddingRegion.gif">
Adding regions like this can be useful to get multiple angles of a 3D model at once while you’re modeling. 

This way, you can have a front view in one 3D view, and a side view in another!
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/TwoRegions.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-6"><span class="orange">Manipulating Objects in Object Mode</span></h3>
Blender works in different interaction modes. 
Up until now, you’ve been working in <em>Object mode</em>, where you can add, delete and manipulate objects. 
Later on in this tutorial, you’ll switch over to <em>Edit mode</em>, where you can edit the vertices, edges and faces of meshes. 

To check what mode you’re currently in, take a look at the left side of the 3D view.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ModeDropdown.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-7"> Selecting Objects</h3>
The cube in your scene should have an orange outline; this means that it’s selected. 
Here are a few ways to quickly select and deselect objects:
<em>Select</em>: Simply click on an object to select it.

<em>Deselect</em>: Click anywhere outside the object to deselect it.
<em>Select all</em>: Press the <em>A</em> key to select all objects.
<em>Deselect all</em>: Press <em>ALT/Option + A</em> or double tap <em>A</em> to deselect all objects.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectDeselect.gif">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-8"> Deleting Objects</h3>
You’re here to create a mushroom, not a sugar cube, so you’ll need to get rid of the cube. 

Select it and press either the X or Delete key to banish it from the scene.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/DeletingCube.png">
If you accidentally deleted the wrong object, you can undo your last action by pressing <em>CTRL/Command + Z</em>.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-9"> 3D Cursor</h3>
Now you’re ready to add some new shapes to your scene. 
But how do you know where they’ll be added? That’s where the 3D cursor comes in!

The 3D cursor is a point in 3D space where new objects and other geometry will be created. 
It looks like a red and white circle with a 3D cross in the middle.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/3DCursor.png">
With every new scene, the 3D cursor is sitting in the middle of the grid, the <em>origin</em>. 
You can manually move the cursor by selecting the <em>3D Cursor</em> tool in the toolbox and clicking anywhere in the 3D view.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MovingCursor.gif">

Make sure to activate the <em>Box Select</em> tool again by clicking the top button in the toolbox once you’re done.
To reset your 3D cursor to the origin, select <em>Object ► Snap ► Cursor to World Origin</em> in the <em>3D View Header</em> or press <em>Shift + S</em> and choose <em>Cursor to World Origin</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SnapCursorToOrigin.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-10"> Adding Objects</h3>
Press <em>Shift + A</em> to display the <em>Add</em> menu and select <em>Mesh</em>. 
You’ll be presented with all built-in shapes that you can add, select <em>Cylinder</em> here to generate a new cylinder.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MeshAdd.png">
Now that you have a cylinder in your scene, click on the <em>Add Cylinder</em> button on the bottom left of the <em>3D View</em>. 
This pops out a menu with the available options for your new shape. 
These only appear immediately after you add an object and before you’ve done any other editing, so now’s your chance to get the settings right!
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/AddCylinderMenu.gif">
You can either click the field and type in the values, or you can scrub back and forth with the mouse to set the values. 

Modify the following properties in the left-hand panel as follows:
<em>Vertices:</em> 10
<em>Radius:</em> 1.5 m
<em>Depth:</em> 3 m
<em>Cap Fill Type:</em> Triangle Fan
Leave all other properties as-is. 

Your panel should appear as below:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/NewCylinderProperties.png">
The cylinder looks like this now:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/CylinderAdded.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-11"><span class="orange">Transforming Objects in Object Mode</span></h3>
In <em>Object Mode</em>, you can move, scale or rotate objects. 

This can be accomplished using shortcut keys, tools and using the <em>Transform</em> properties.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-12"> Transforming with Shortcut Keys</h3>
To transform an object using the shortcut keys, first ensure the object is selected. 
Next, press the key to begin the action and move the mouse to adjust the transform. 
The further you move the mouse, the greater the effect. 
To complete a transform, you simply <em>left click</em>, to discard the changes you <em>right click</em>.

The shortcut keys for transforms are as follows:
<em>Move</em>: G
<em>Scale</em>: S
<em>Rotate</em>: R
<em>Note:</em> If <em>G</em> is hard to remember for a <em>Move</em> action, try thinking of <em>grabbing</em> the object!
Try scaling the cylinder up a bit! Make sure it’s selected, press the <em>S</em> key and move your cursor outwards until you’re satisfied with the change. 

Once the cylinder has grown a bit, left click anywhere in the <em>3D View</em> to confirm:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ScaleCylinder.gif" alt="Demonstation of scaling the cylinder. 
Press S, move outwards, click">
You can constrain transforms to a particular axis by pressing its letter: <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, or <em>Z</em>. 
So, if you only want to scale along the Z axis, press <em>S</em>, and then press <em>Z</em>:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ScaleCylinderZOnly.gif">

Feel free to play around with the cylinder by moving, scaling and rotating it. 
Just make sure to undo the action each time using <em>CTRL/Command + Z</em>.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-13"> Transforming Using Tools</h3>
The second method to transform your object is by using the <em>Move</em>, <em>Rotate</em>, <em>Scale</em> and <em>Transform</em> tools from the <em>Toolbar</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/TransformTools.png">
Select the <em>Move</em> tool from the <em>Toolbar</em> and drag the blue arrow up with your mouse. 

You should see the object translate along the Z-axis. 
Undo this change by pressing <em>CTRL/Command + Z</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/UsingMoveTool.gif">
The <em>Scale</em> and <em>Rotate</em> tools work exactly the same. 
The <em>Transform</em> tool combines the three other transform tool into a single gizmo.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/TransformToolGizmo.png">

<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-14"> Transforming with Properties</h3>
The third method of transforming — editing the object properties directly — offers the most control. 
You can use this method if you need very specific control over the shape and position of your object.
Make sure the <em>Object Properties</em> tab is active in <em>Properties region</em>. 
You can transform the object by changing its <em>Location</em>, <em>Rotation</em>, and <em>Scale</em> values directly, as shown below:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ObjectProperties.png">

<em>Note:</em> Blender measures distance by using the <em>Metric</em> unit system by default. 
If you want to use “freedom units” instead, you can switch to the <em>Imperial</em> units by activating the <em>Scene Properties</em> tab in the <em>Properties region</em>, unfolding the <em>Units</em> section and setting the <em>Unit System</em> to <em>Imperial</em>. 
For this tutorial, leave this at <em>Metric</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SwitchToImperial.gif">
That covers the most important aspects of <em>Object Mode</em>. 
Now it’s time to edit the vertices, edges, and faces of the object!

<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-15"><span class="orange">Editing Objects in Edit Mode</span></h3>
<em>Edit Mode</em> is where you delve deep into the details of an object and change its geometry. 
To enter <em>Edit Mode</em>, select the object to be edited and press <em>Tab</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/EditModeCylinder.png">
You’ll see that the object turns orange and all of its edges and points are highlighted. 
The icons at the left of the <em>3D View Header</em> tell you which select mode you are in: vertex mode (left icon), edge mode (middle icon), or face mode (right icon), as shown below:

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/EditSelectModes.png">
<em>Note:</em> If the relation between faces, edges and vertices isn’t clear, here’s a quick rundown! Every mesh consists of faces that make up the surface, every face consists of multiple edges, most commonly three (called a tri) or four (called a quad). 
Every edge consists of two vertices.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/VerticesEdgesFaces.png">
At the moment, you’re in <em>Vertex mode</em>, with everything in your object selected. 
Double tap the <em>A</em> key to deselect everything and click one of the vertices to select it. 

Hold down <em>Shift</em> and click another vertex to add it to the selection. 
Finally deselect everything again.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectVertices.gif">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-16"> Loop Cut and Slide</h3>
At the moment, your object doesn’t look much like a mushroom, does it? Before you can deform your cylinder to look like a mushroom, you’ll need to add a few more <em>segments</em>. 
To add segments you’ll need to do a <em>loop cut</em>; either activate the <em>Loop Cut</em> tool from the <em>Toolbox</em> or press the <em>CTRL/Command + R</em> shortcut to start creating a new loop cut.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/LoopCutTool.png">
Now move your mouse over the side of the cylinder, and you’ll see a yellow edge ring show up.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ShowLoop.gif">
Now the exact way this works depends on the way you start the loop cut:
<em>Loop Cut Tool</em>: Click and drag the ring, you’ll notice it will turn orange and will follow your cursor. 
Drag the ring about up until there’s about a third left, then release the mouse button.

<em>Loop Cut Shortcut</em>: Click once so the ring turns orange and starts following your cursor. 
Drag the ring about up until there’s about a third left, then click to confirm.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MakeLoopCut.gif">
If you don’t like where the loop ended up, use <em>CTRL/Command + Z</em> to undo the action.
Now double tap the <em>A</em> key to deselect all vertices.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-17"><span class="orange">Selecting Vertices, Edges, and Faces</span></h3>

You <i>could</i> select the edges to be moved by holding <em>Shift</em> and clicking, each of them, but that can be cumbersome when you’ve got a lot of edges to select. 
Fortunately, there are several ways to select multiple items!
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-18"> Selection Tools</h3>
Click and hold the <em>Select Box Tool</em> in the <em>Toolbox</em>. 
Most of the tool icons have little arrows indicating they’re part of a group. 
In the case of the <em>Select Box Tool</em>, it’s part of a selection tools group, so you can switch to a <em>Select Circle Tool</em> or a <em>Select Lasso Tool</em>.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectionOptions.png">
You can activate another tool in the same group by releasing your mouse button while hovering over the tool you want to use.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ToolsInAGroup.gif">
Here’s an overview of the selection tools:
<em>Select Box</em>: Drag and hold a selection box around a selection. 
Release to confirm.

<em>Select Circle</em>: Drag and hold a circle over a selection. 
Release to confirm
<em>Select Lasso</em>: Drag and hold a free-form shape around a selection. 
Release to confirm.
With each of these, holding <em>Shift</em> while selecting will add to the selection and holding <em>CTRL/Command</em> will remove from the selection.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectionTools.gif">

<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-19"> Edge Loop Selection Shortcut</h3>
Besides the selection tools, there’s another way to select an edge loop, with a handy shortcut! Hold <em>ALT/Option</em> and click on an edge in the loop you want to select, this will select the whole loop. 
As with other ways of selecting, holding <em>Shift</em> while doing this will add to your selection and holding <em>CTRL/Command</em> will subtract from the selection.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectEdgeLoops.gif">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-20"><span class="orange">Transforming Edges, Vertices, and Faces</span></h3>
Transforming edges, vertices, and faces is very similar to transforming an entire object: you can use the same tools and shortcuts to move, rotate and scale your selection. 

I will focus on the shortcut keys as it’s good practice to use and remember those, but feel free to use the tools from the <em>Toolbar</em> instead.
Select the horizontal edge loop you added last if it isn’t selected yet, press the <em>G</em> key to move the vertices followed by the <em>Z</em> key to constrain the movement to the <em>Z-axis</em>. 
Now move your cursor up until the edge loop is near the top of the model and click to confirm.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MoveLoopUp.gif">
Add some more detail to the cylinder by doing two more loop cuts near the bottom. 
Use either the <em>Loop Cut Tool</em> or the <em>CTRL/Command + R</em> shortcut to do this.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/AddedBottomLoops.png">
Now it’s time to alter the edges and faces to create the top of your mushroom!
Select the top edge loop and press <em>S</em> to scale the edge loop. 
Next, drag your cursor inwards so the edge loop shrinks and confirm with a click:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ScalingTheTop.gif">
Next, you need to make the bottom edge of the top of the mushroom larger than the top. 

Select the second and third edge loops from the bottom and scale them up until you get a nice mushroom cap shape. 
Remember to hold <em>Shift</em> to add to your selection.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ScaleBottomUp.gif">
The lower edge of your mushroom looks a little thin, time to learn another trick! Double tap <em>A</em> to deselect everything and select just the third edge loop from the top. 
Now double tap the <em>G</em> key, this activates <em>Edge Slide</em> mode, which allows you to slide edges between edge loops smoothly. 
Move your cursor up until the bottom faces are a fair bit bigger and click to confirm.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/LoopSlide.gif">
It’s looking more like a mushroom now!
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-21"> Using the Extrude Tool</h3>
Your mushroom head is looking pretty good, but every good mushroom needs a stalk! You’ll do this by using the extrude tool.
Move the view around so you can see the bottom of the mushroom head. 
You’re going to create the stalk by extruding the bottom faces of your mushroom head.

Switch to <em>Face Select</em> mode by clicking the <em>Face Select</em> icon or press the <em>3</em> key on your number row.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SwitchToFaceSelect.png">
Now select the inner fan of faces on the bottom using any of the selection techniques and press the <em>E</em> key to start extruding. 
As soon as you do so, your mouse movement extrudes the selected faces, creating a stem. 
Move your cursor down until the stem is about as big as the cap and click to confirm.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ExtrudeBottom.gif">

Now extrude the same faces one more time just a bit to create the rounded bottom of the stalk.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ExtrudedMoreBottom.png">
Now scale the faces inward by a small amount to create a beveled edge.
[spoiler title=”Solution Inside: Can’t remember how to scale?”]
Press the <em>S</em> key, move inwards with your cursor and click to confirm.
[/spoiler]

Your mushroom should look similar to this fine specimen:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BeveledEdge.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-22"><span class="orange">Changing the Object Origin</span></h3>
Your mushroom is sprouting up nicely! However, at the moment your mushroom is almost fully buried underground, as shown in this front view:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MushroomBuried.png">
You’ll need to move your mushroom upwards a little bit to have it sitting properly on the XY plane. 

You could just eyeball it, select all faces and move the whole mesh up until it looks about right, but it’s good practice to align things neatly. 
In order to get the mushroom placed perfectly, you will need to do some steps:
Move the 3D cursor to the lowest center point of the mushroom.
Set the origin of the mushroom to to where the 3D cursor is at.
Move the mushroom to the world origin.
To start off, double tap the <em>A</em> key to deselect everything. 

Next, switch to <em>Vertex Select</em> mode and select the center bottom vertex in the stalk.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectBottomVertex.gif">
Now press <em>Shift + S</em> and choose <em>Cursor to Selected</em>. 
The 3D cursor moved to the selected vertex, which is exactly where the origin should be placed.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/CurrentDesiredOrigin.png">
Hit <em>Tab</em> to switch to <em>Object Mode</em>. 

Right click the mushroom and choose <em>Set Origin ► Origin to 3D Cursor</em> to move the origin to the bottom.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MoveOrigin.gif">
Now move the mushroom back to the world origin by setting its position to <em>(X:0, Y:0, Z:0)</em>. 
Either change its <em>Z</em> location to <em>0</em> in the <em>Properties</em> region or simply press <em>ALT/Option + G</em> to clear the location, Blender is all about shortcuts after all!
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/PoppingUpAboveGround.gif">
Making a “pop” sound effect is optional while doing this, but it sure is fun. 

:]
Now don’t forget to save all your hard work. 
Navigate to <em>File ► Save</em>, or simply press <em>CTRL/Command + S</em> to open the save dialog. 
Next, choose a good location, name your project “Mushroom.blend” and hit <em>Enter</em> twice or click the <em>Save As</em> button.
At this point you’ve already created a mushroom from scratch so pat yourself on the back! While your mushroom could be used as-is if you really wanted to, I hope you’ll agree that a dash of color would make it even better.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-23"><span class="orange">Coloring the Mushroom</span></h3>

Coloring an object in Blender is done in three steps:
Applying a material
Unwrapping the mesh into a 2D texture that you can paint on (called a UV wrap)
Painting on the UV wrap
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-24"> Applying a Material</h3>
Start off with activating the <em>Material Properties</em> tab in the <em>Poperties</em> region.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MaterialProperties.png">
The <em>Material Properties</em> tab contains a list of materials available to the selected object. 
Time to add the first material to the mushroom! Click the <em>New</em> button below the list, you’ll see a new material appear in the list with a bunch of material properties below it:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MaterialAdded.png">
The material is currently named “Material.001”. 
Give it a more descriptive name by clicking the material name and type in <em>“Mushroom”</em> followed by <em>Enter</em> to confirm the name change.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/RenamedMaterial.png">
There are lots of ways you can change your material, but leave it as-is for now, since you’ll be adding a texture later in this tutorial.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-25"> Unwrapping a Mesh</h3>
The next step is to unwrap the mesh so that you have a flat “canvas” to paint on. 
This is much like peeling an orange and laying the peel down flat on a table.
The easiest way to start the unwrapping process is by switching to the <em>UV Editing</em> workspace. 

You can switch workspaces by clicking on the tabs at the top, so click on the one that’s labeled <em>UV Editing</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/UvEditingWorkspace.png">
A workspace is a predefined region layout. 
Up until now you’ve been modeling in the <em>Layout</em> workspace, which is meant for general modeling tasks. 
The <em>UV Editing</em> workspace is split into two main regions: an <em>UV Editor</em> and a <em>3D View</em> in <em>Edit Mode</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/UVEditingOverview.png">

Right now the UV editor is blank because you haven’t unwrapped anything yet. 
Place your cursor in the right-hand window and hit <em>A</em> to select all vertices. 
You might notice that the UV map on the left is displaying the default map for a cylinder now, since that gets generated automatically when creating a new mesh. 
That map won’t be usable though, since it doesn’t match the mushroom mesh. 
That would be like trying to wrap a nice poster around a plush doll, lots of weird bends all over the place.
Time to create a brand new UV map! Imagine your model as if it’s made out of paper and you need to make cuts in it along the edges until you can lay it out flat on a table in separate pieces. 

That’s basically the gist of what UV unwrapping is, fully mapping a 3D object to a 2D image.
The “cuts” in this case are called <em>seams</em>, just like the ones you’d find on your clothes or plushies. 
To start creating seams, you need to be in <em>Edge Select</em> mode first, so click on the <em>Edge Select</em> button in the <em>3D View Header</em> or press <em>2</em> on your number row.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectEdgeSelect.png">
Deselect all edges by double tapping <em>A</em>. 
Next, select these four edge loops by holding <em>ALT/Option</em> and clicking the edges:

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectSeamLoops.png">
Now right click and select <em>Mark Seam</em>. 
You’ll notice that those edges have become bright red.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/Seams.png">
Blender can now figure out where to cuts into the model to create a flat UV map. 
To update the UV map on the left based on the seams you made, press the <em>A</em> key to select all edges followed by <em>U</em> and select <em>Unwrap</em>.

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/UnwrapNew.gif">
You’ll now see a map similar to this in the <em>UV Editor</em>:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/UnwrappedMap.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-26"> Creating the Texture</h3>
Now that you have unwrapped the mesh, you need to add an image for the mesh to be mapped to. 
This is like drawing or painting on the “paper pieces” you laid out on the table while having a copy of the original model that’s linked to the pieces, reflecting everything you do.

Click the <em>New</em> button in the header of the <em>UV Editor</em> on the left to start creating an image texture.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/NewImage.png">
A small menu pops up for you to fill in, leave everything at their default values except for the name, put “MushroomTexture” in there and click <em>OK</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/NewImageProperties.png">
The background of the <em>UV Editor</em> now becomes black, this is the image you just created. 
Before you start editing the image, it’s a good idea to save it as an image next to your .blend file. 

Select <em>Image ► Save</em> in the header (or press <em>Alt/Option + S</em>) and press the <em>Save As Image</em> button to save the image as a PNG.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SaveAsImage.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-27"> Preparing the Material</h3>
You might have noticed that the mushroom still looks pretty gray. 
This is because the base color in its material is still set to a solid white color. 
To link your texture to the mushroom’s material, open the <em>Material Properties</em> tab in the <em>Properties</em> section and click the small yellow button next to <em>Base Color</em>. 

A selection menu will open up, select <em>Image Texture</em>  here so Blender knows the colors will come from an image texture.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectImageTextureProperty.png">
Next, click the image dropdown button left from the <em>New</em> button and select <em>MushroomTexture</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/TextureDropdown.png">
Now switch to the <em>Texture Paint</em> workspace by clicking the tab with the same name at the top of the Blender window.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SelectTexturePaint.png">

Now the mushroom looks pitch black and is finally ready for painting!
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/BlackMushroom.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-28"> Using Your Brush</h3>
The <em>Texture Paint</em> workspace consists of two regions: an <em>Image Editor</em> in <em>Paint Mode</em> on the left and a <em>3D View</em> in <em>Texture Paint Mode</em> on the right. 
The <em>Image Editor</em> is used to paint onto your texture, while you can paint directly on the 3D model in the <em>3D View</em>.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ImageEditor3DView.png">

Time to add a splash of color to this mushroom!
<em>Note:</em> From now on, don’t worry if things look different on your side — painting is all about being creative and doing whatever feels right to <i>you</i>. 
If you want to make the mushroom purple or green with yellow stripes, go right ahead and let the artistic juices flow through your body.
Right now, the edges of your virtual brush hold a lot less paint than the center, while you want more of a permanent marker at this point, nice and full. 
To achieve this, change the falloff curve of your brush in the <em>Properties</em> region to be a straight line by clicking the <em>Falloff</em> menu open en choosing the last icon in the series.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/SettingFalloff.gif">

Now you’re ready to do some painting, choose a color you like in the color picker wheel. 
I’m going with a bright red. 
You can click the color on the left for a more detailed color menu where you can set the saturation or even the hex value.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/ChoosingColor.png">
With your color chosen, click and drag over the mushroom in the <em>3D View</em> to paint its cap. 
Rotate the view around and zoom in and out to get a good look at what you’re doing. 

You can change the size of the brush by pressing the <em>F</em> key, moving your cursor until you found the right size and clicking to confirm.
Don’t worry if the color get somewhere you don’t want it, you can use <em>CTRL/Command + Z</em> to undo your last action, or just leave it as-is and fix it in the next steps!
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/Painting.gif">
Here’s how mine looks like after adding this first color:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/FirstPaintCoat.png">
If you take a look at the UV map, that could be a piece of art by itself!

<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/UVMapAfterPaint.png">
Now for the rest of the mushroom, I’m going with an off-white color, but feel free to choose any color you like.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/OffWhite.png">
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-29"> Using a Mask</h3>
It’s time for a new trick to make things easier! You can mask out parts of your model so only those faces can get paint on them. 
If you ever painted in real life before, this like applying painter’s tape next to the parts you’re giving a fresh lick of paint so you don’t accidentally paint something you didn’t want to.

To create a mask, press the <em>Tab</em> key when hovering over the <em>3D View</em> to enter <em>Edit Mode</em> and activate <em>Face Select</em> mode by pressing <em>3</em> on your numpad or by clicking the corresponding icon in the header. 
Now select the faces you just painted and press the <em>CTRL/Command + I</em> to invert your selection, thus selecting the black faces.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/CreateMask.gif">
Now switch back to <em>Texture Paint Mode</em> by pressing <em>Tab</em> and click the little button between the mode dropdown and the <em>View</em> button, this activates the <em>Paint Mask</em>. 
All faces of the mushroom where you can’t paint are now faded and lighter in color.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MaskApplied.png">

Now paint away all around the model without worry, you can’t paint over your first color.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/PaintingSecondLayer.gif">
For a final touch, I’m going to add white spots and a face to the mushroom. 
Why? Because I can! Make sure to disable the <em>Paint Mask</em> first by clicking that little button again, this way you can paint with total freedom once again.
For these final features, I’m going to be using pure white and pure black. 
First some white spots on the head, then two black stretched circles for the eyes and then a point of white in each to emulate some bright light hitting it. 

Like this:
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MushroomFinalPaint.png">
You can do the same, or do something completely different. 
I’d love to see what you came up with so make sure to share your creation in the discussion below!
Now save your texture to its file by hovering over the <em>Image Editor</em> and pressing <em>ALT/Option + S</em> or by selecting <em>Image ► Save</em> in the header. 
This is a crucial step, as you can imagine the horror of forgetting to save your nice paint job and returning to Blender to see a black mushroom, ouch.

The last thing you need to do is export your masterpiece so you can use it in your game or application.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-30"><span class="orange">Exporting Files</span></h3>
Depending on the specifications of your game engine, API, etc. 
of choice you need to export to a different 3D format. 
Always check the documentation of your tool before choosing a format.
The two most popular formats are FBX and OBJ: FBX is a proprietary file format owned by Autodesk that holds both the mesh and material data in a single file. 

OBJ on the other hand is an open format developed by Wavefront Technologies. 
It’s a simple data format that only holds mesh data, the material description is stored in a separate MTL file. 
For both of these, any textures are stored separately in image formats like JPG, PNG or TIFF.
Blender has a lot more export options built-in and even more can be added via add-ons, but in this tutorial I’ll go over the basics of exporting FBX and OBJ files. 
For both of these, you’ll need the <em>Mushroom.png</em> image file to use as a texture, so keep both the exported 3D file(s) and that image in the same folder.
Before delving into exporting, switch back to the <em>Layout</em> workspace by clicking its tab at the top and make sure to select just the mushroom by clicking on it. 

It should have an orange outline.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/MushroomSelected.png">
By default, the exporters will export <i>everything</i> in the scene, including any cameras and lights. 
By selecting just the mesh(es), you can easily only export the 3D data you want.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-31"> Exporting to FBX</h3>
Select <em>File ► Export ► FBX (.fbx)</em> in the top menu to open an export window. 

This is essentially the same as the file save window, with some specific options on the right for exporting. 
Check the <em>Selected Objects</em> checkbox here to only export the mushroom mesh.
<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2021/03/OnlySelected.png">
That’s it! You should already be in the same folder as your .blend file and the texture image, so click the blue <em>Export FBX</em> button at the bottom to create a brand new FBX.
<h3 id="MakeAMushroomtopic-32"> Exporting to OBJ</h3>
The procedure for exporting to the OBJ is almost exactly the same.

Select <em>File ► Export ► Wavefront (.obj)</em> in the top menu to open an export window. 
Check the <em>Selected Objects</em> checkbox and click the blue <em>Export OBJ</em> button at the bottom. 
This creates two files: <em>Mushroom.obj</em> with the 3D mesh data and <em>Mushroom.mtl</em> which holds the material data.
Now that you have the model in popular 3D formats, you can put mushrooms in all of your games, applications or even 3D print some if you’re feeling wacky like yours truly!
