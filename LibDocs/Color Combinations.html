<p> <em>Color makes a design come alive.</em></p>
<p>It can attract attention, set a mood, and even<a href="https://learn.canva.com/blog/color-science/"> influence our emotions and perceptions</a>.</p>
<p>But sometimes it can be hard to know where to start when choosing a color palette for your design project.</p>
<p>So we've done the hard work for you- giving you 100 color combinations inspired by nature, food & drink, travel, and everyday items.</p>

<h2>Nature</h2>
<h2>01. <br>
Fresh & Bright</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-1.png">


<p>Fresh greenery and colorful blossoms make springtime a welcome sight after a long winter. <br>
This color palette features bright shades of green and coral that will make your design pop. <br>
These types of colors might be used for a spring- or summer-season event poster or perhaps an advertisement that wants to come across as fresh and youthful.</p>
<h2>02. <br>
Subdued & Professional</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-2.png">


<p>Red and blue are some of the most common colors that businesses use for branding, and for good reason. <br>
Red says "confident and powerful," while blue says "calming and trustworthy." This palette offers a little bit of both, with slightly desaturated shades that aren't overpowering. <br>
To the conservative blue and gray hues, the brick red shade adds a burst of extra color that is still professional. <br>
This would work well in any corporate context or for a more "serious" design project.</p>
<h2>03. <br>
Dark & Earthy</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-3.png">


<p>Desert landscapes are full of dramatic contrasts, and so is this color scheme. <br>
For an unexpected color combination that is more toned down than bright and garish, try this pairing featuring shades of plum and reddish-orange.</p>
<h2>04. <br>
Crisp & Dramatic</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-4.png">


<p>Iceland's natural beauty is legendary, and this palette tries to capture its dramatic contrasts. <br>
The warm, grayish undertones of the top two colors contrast nicely with the cooler greens. <br>
A range of lighter and darker shades makes it easy to combine any two or three of the colors and have them still complement each other.</p>
<h2>05. <br>
Cool Blues</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-5.png">


<p>Monochromatic color schemes (made up of the various tints, tones, or shades of one color) are extremely versatile. <br>
While this palette may not qualify as monochromatic according to the technical definition, for visual purposes, it creates a similar effect. <br>
With a color as multipurpose as blue, this combination could be used just about anywhere.</p>
<h2>06. <br>
Outdoorsy & Natural</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-6.png">


<p>If you have a brand or need a design that emphasizes natural or "green" qualities, a color palette featuring greens and browns is a logical choice. <br>
Rather than your typical dull shades, this palette brightens things up with a splash of lime green.</p>
<h2>07. <br>
Watery Blue-Greens</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-7.png">

<h2>08. <br>
Primary Colors With a Vibrant Twist</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-8.png">


<h2>09. <br>
Refreshing & Pretty</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-9.png">

<p>Crisp turquoise hues set off bright yellow and bubblegum pink for a palette almost reminiscent of Easter candy. <br>
If the pink makes the palette too "girly" for your design's purposes, just leave it out and opt for the top two aqua shades plus the yellow for a bright, clean combination.</p>
<h2>10. <br>
Playful Greens & Blues</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-10.png">


<p>The bluish shades at the top and bottom of this selection have gray undertones, which makes them almost neutral - a great foundation for playing with more daring tones like the lime green.</p>
<h2>11. <br>
Fresh & Energetic</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-11.png">


<p>The almost neon shades of blue and green balance out the other two more conservative colors and add a bright freshness that gives the combination some kick. <br>
This kind of scheme might work well for a fitness brand or any design that needs to balance a businesslike feel with an energetic vibe.</p>
<h2>12. <br>
Surf & Turf</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-12.png">


<p>This landscape features both warm and cool colors in both bright and subdued shades. <br>
The beachy, mellow color palette inspired by it draws from those contrasts for a combination that brings to mind relaxing island vacations - just one example of how we can associate color with certain places, moods, or emotions.</p>
<h2>13. <br>
Autumn in Vermont</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-13.png">


<h2>14. <br>
Icy Blues and Grays</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-14.png">

<p>Contrasting warm grays with cool, glacial blues makes for a dynamic color scheme that's more visually interesting than your average combination of drab blues and grays. <br>
If you're in need of a palette that's more restrained, instead of opting for navy and dark gray, try these lighter, brighter hues.</p>
<h2>15. <br>
Birds & Berries</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-15.png">


<h2>16. <br>
Day & Night</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-16.png">


<h2>17. <br>
Stylish & Retro</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-17.png">


<p>The muted shades of this color scheme have a vintage vibe, with the light aqua and gold particularly being colors that were popular in the 1950s and 60s. <br>
But that doesn't mean this combination looks dated. <br>
These colors (and the mid-century modern aesthetic in general) have seen a resurgence in popularity and still look stylish.</p>
<h2>18. <br>
Shades of Citrus</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-18.png">


<h2>19. <br>
Sunset to Dusk</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-19.png">

<h2>20. <br>
Bright & Tropical</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-20.png">


<h2>21. <br>
Warm Naturals</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-21.png">


<h2>22. <br>
Bold Berries</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-22.png">


<h2>23. <br>
Summer Sunflower</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-23.png">


<p>This combination has an outdoor feel to it, like a summer baseball game: you have the red dirt of the baseball diamond, the green grass in the outfield, the bright sun in a blue sky overhead. <br>
However, it's more subtle (and has more variety of color) than, say, the more obvious greens and browns in #6.</p>
<h2>24. <br>
Modern & Crisp</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-24.png">


<p>Pairing black and white with bright, crisp shades of green makes for a modern palette that is sophisticated without being too serious. <br>
Instead of pairing red or blue with your black and white, freshen things up with some green.</p>
<h2>25. <br>
Timeless & Nautical</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-25.png">

<h2></h2>
<h2>Food & Drink</h2>
<h2>26. <br>
Neutral & Versatile</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-26.png">

<p>Neutral colors like the shades of gray and tan here are very versatile and can be paired with almost anything. <br>
A color scheme of all neutrals, however, can be quite nice, too. <br>
Depending on how you apply it to a design, it can be upscale and sophisticated (think branding for a luxury hotel) or calming and comfortable (think the d&eacute;cor of a favorite neighborhood coffee shop).</p>
<h2>27. <br>
Cheerful Brights</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-27.png">

<h2>28. <br>
Garden Fresh</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-28.png">


<h2>29. <br>
Summer Barbeque</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-29.png">


<h2>30. <br>
Berry Blues</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-30.png">

<h2>31. <br>
Lemonade Stand</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-31.png">


<h2>32. <br>
Serene & Spa-Like</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-32.png">


<p>Calming, spa-like greens and blue - great by themselves - look a little more lively with a splash of raspberry as an accent color. <br>
Adding a brighter or bolder accent color to a more restrained selection is a nice technique to liven up a color palette and give it a little extra interest.</p>
<h2>33. <br>
Fun & Tropical</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-33.png">


<p>This happy blend of colors doesn't take itself too seriously. <br>
Have a summer party invitation to design? Maybe a children's event poster or advertisement? A palette like this one will make it clear where the fun is at.</p>
<h2>34. <br>
Spicy Neutrals</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-34.png">


<p>Shades ranging from light to dark make it easy to apply this color palette to a design. <br>
There's enough contrast that you can choose a background color, a text color, and an accent color or two just from these four.</p>
<h2>35. <br>
Pastels</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-35.png">


<p>Applications for a pastel palette will be somewhat limited - designs having to do with Easter, spring, babies, or tea parties are pretty safe choices. <br>
Pastel colors generally come across as pretty and delicate, so you'll want to make sure your design calls for a similar mood if you want to use a color combination like this one.</p>
<h2>36. <br>
Bold & Cultured</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-36.png">


<h2>37. <br>
Sunny Citrus</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-37.png">


<h2>38. <br>
Crisp Complementary Colors</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-38.png">


<p>Red and green is one of three pairs of complementary (or opposite) colors on the traditional color wheel; others include orange/blue and violet/yellow. <br>
When combined, these colors make a striking, high-contrast impression that can be a little jarring if you don't use them carefully. <br>
That's why, for this palette, the reds and greens have been balanced and toned down (not full saturation like the red and green you see on Christmas decorations) for a fresher twist on a complementary color palette.</p>
<h2>39. <br>
Warm & Rustic</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-39.png">


<h2>40. <br>
Neon Night</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-40.png">


<h2>41. <br>
Jewel Tones</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-41.png">


<h2>42. <br>
Polished & Inviting</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-42.png">


<p>Warm grays with a pop of golden yellow is a combination you'll see sometimes in interior design and home d&eacute;cor contexts. <br>
It's primarily neutral (and the warmness of the grays feels calming and inviting) but the yellow adds some cheerfulness and energy for an overall palette that's refined but not stuffy.</p>
<h2>43. <br>
Fresh Greens</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-43.png">

<h2>44. <br>
Wintery Reds</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-44.png">

<p>Reminiscent of winter berries and bare branches against a snowy sky, this combination of colors would make a great alternative to your traditional Christmas or holiday palettes. <br>
The rich reds paired with violet-tinged grays feel festive, but sophisticated.</p>
<h2>45. <br>
Summer Fiesta</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-45.png">

<h2>46. <br>
Chocolaty Browns</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-46.png">

<p>Who says brown has to be boring? Add some red and violet undertones, and you have a full, rich color palette that - like these chocolate cupcakes - feels a little decadent.</p>
<h2>47. <br>
Naturally Elegant</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-47.png">

<h2>48. <br>
Cozy & Warm</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-48.png">

<h2>49. <br>
Violet Sunset</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-49.png">

<h2>50. <br>
Strawberries & Cream</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-50.png">

<h2></h2>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<h2>51. <br>
Grecian Holiday</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-51.png">

<h2>52. <br>
Bold & Basic</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-52.png">

<p>White, black (or in this case, very dark navy), red, and yellow is a very common combination. <br>
But with these saturated shades, it certainly isn't boring. <br>
If you're looking for a bold palette that doesn't mess around with unusual colors but that still makes a strong, eye-catching statement in your design, this type of color scheme is an easy one to apply.</p>
<h2>53. <br>
Vineyard Neutrals</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-53.png">

<h2>54. <br>
Modern & Urban</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-54.png">

<h2>55. <br>
Misty Greens</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-55.png">

<h2>56. <br>
Sunkissed Village</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-56.png">

<p>Many cliff-hugging villages along the Mediterranean coast are painted in warm pastels. <br>
You can replicate that sunny, carefree look with this selection of shades and bring a little of the Italian <i>dolce vita </i>to your design, creating a warm and welcoming effect.</p>
<h2>57. <br>
Sun & Sky</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-57.png">

<h2>58. <br>
Aqua Blues</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-58.png">

<h2>59. <br>
Urban Oasis</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-59.png">

<h2>60. <br>
Candy-Coated Brights</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-60.png">

<p>These vibrant hues look like they belong in a candy store, and they're sure to give a design some youthful energy. <br>
Just make sure that it's okay that the overall effect of the design is a little "loud," because like the graffiti they're inspired by, these colors certainly aren't quiet; they're out to make a statement.</p>
<h2>61. <br>
Muted & Antique</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-61.png">

<h2>62. <br>
Classy & Timeless</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-62.png">

<p>It's hard to replicate a metallic effect with just flat color, but dark blue and gold is a timeless combination that you'll see on everything from swanky party invitations to the official colors of elite schools and sports teams. <br>
To add a little class to a design, try some combination of the two colors. <br>
(If you can manage to get your design printed with gold foil accents, even better!)</p>
<h2>63. <br>
Cosmopolitan</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-63.png">

<h2>64. <br>
Cheerful & Friendly</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-64.png">

<h2>65. <br>
Nightlife</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-65.png">

<p>The ink colors that all printers use (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black; abbreviated CMYK) make a striking combination on their own, similar to the neon and illuminated signs of a big city at night.</p>
<h2>66. <br>
Coastal</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-66.png">

<h2>67. <br>
Maritime Brights</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-67.png">

<h2>68. <br>
Vintage Charm</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-68.png">

<h2>69. <br>
Understated & Versatile</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-69.png">

<h2>70. <br>
Arctic Sunrise</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-70.png">

<p>Blue and gray always work nicely together (and you could certainly use the bottom three selections of this palette by themselves) - but the addition of a light coral pink, along with the brighter blues, gives this combination a little extra sparkle.</p>
<h2>71. <br>
Mediterranean Afternoon</h2>

<img src="https://learn.canva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color-combo-71.png">

<p>Lunch at an Italian restaurant, anyone? Some of the things most often associated with Italian cuisine - wine, rich tomato sauce, fresh handmade pasta - all make an appearance in this color scheme. <br>
Try it out to add some warmth and flavor to a design. <br>
The inclusion of a creamy neutral shade balances out the more colorful selections; you can use it as a background or base color and one or more of the others as tasteful accents.</p>
<h2>72. <br>
Hazy Grays</h2>

<p>Black, gray, and white are always acceptable, usable colors. <br>
But add some cobalt blue, and those run-of-the-mill neutral shades become a backdrop for a modern, attractive palette that could work for any design style, from corporate to trendy.</p>

<p>Red or blue might be common pairings for basic black and white, but here, a deeper red along with a brighter turquoise blue gives a fresh twist to a familiar combination.</p>

<p>Reminiscent of colors you might see decorating a beach house, this palette is slightly nautical, slightly faded and vintage, but the hues included here won't box you into a certain style. <br>
They're pretty versatile and subtle, and won't overwhelm your design.</p>

<p>Dark wood, leather, old books - things you might find in an English pub or one of those gentlemen's clubs you see in old movies. <br>
If your design could use some suave sophistication, try out this combination of rich browns plus a lighter, smoky neutral shade.</p>
