<h2><span class="orange">How to Add & Subtract Weeks to Date in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formulas to add and subtract weeks from a date in Google Sheets:
<b>Formula 1: Add Weeks to Date</b>
<b>=A1+7*(3) </b>
This particular formula adds <b>3</b> weeks to the date in cell <b>A1</b>.
<b>Formula 2: Subtract Weeks from Date</b>
<b>=A1-7*(1) </b>
This particular formula subtracts <b>1</b> week from the date in cell <b>A1</b>.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:

<h2><span class="orange">How to Auto Increment Values in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to automatically increment values in Google Sheets.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the drag-and-fill feature built into Google Sheets and the following examples show how to do so in different scenarios.
<h3>Example 1: Auto Increment Values by One</h3>
Suppose we’d like to create a list of values from 0 to 20.
First, type the values 0 and 1 into consecutive cells:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto1.png">
Next, highlight both cells. Then hover over the bottom right corner of the cell containing the value 1:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto2.png">
When you see a tiny “<b>+</b>” symbol appear, simply click and drag down to copy the pattern into the remaining cells in the column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto3.png">
The result is a list of values that range from 0 to 20, automatically incremented by one.
<h3>Example 2: Auto Increment Values by a Multiple</h3>
Suppose we’d like to create a list of values ranging from 0 to 20, auto incremented by four.
First, type the values 0 and 4 into consecutive cells:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto4.png">
Next, highlight both cells. Then hover over the bottom right corner of the cell containing the value 4:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto5.png">
When you see a tiny “<b>+</b>” symbol appear, simply click and drag down to copy the pattern into the remaining cells in the column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto6.png">
The result is a list of values that range from 0 to 20, automatically incremented by four.
<h3>Example 3: Auto Increment a Pattern</h3>
Suppose we’d like to create a list of weeks called “Week 1, Week 2, Week 3,” and so on.
First, type “Week 1” into a cell:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto7.png">
Next, select the cell then hover over the bottom right corner of it. When you see a tiny “<b>+</b>” symbol appear, simply click and drag down to copy the pattern into the remaining cells in the column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/auto8.png">
The result is a list of week names ranging from Week 1 to Week 10.
<h2><span class="orange">How to AutoFill Dates in Google Sheets (3 Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to autofill dates in Google Sheets. Fortunately this is easy to do using the simple drag and fill feature built into Google Sheets.
The following examples show how to autofill dates in Google Sheets in practice.
<h3>Example 1: AutoFill Days in Google Sheets</h3>
To autofill a list of days in Google Sheets, simply type in one date to start:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fill1.png">
Then hover over the bottom right-hand corner of the cell until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears. Then click and drag down to however many cells you’d like in the same column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fill2.png">
The result is a list of consecutive days.
<h3>Example 2: AutoFill Weeks in Google Sheets</h3>
To autofill a list of weeks in Google Sheets, simply type in two dates that are exactly one week apart:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fill3.png">
Then highlight both cell A1 and cell A2, then hover over the bottom right-hand corner of cell A2 until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears.
Then click and drag down to however many cells you’d like in the same column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fill4.png">
The result is a list of consecutive weeks.
<h3>Example 3: AutoFill Months in Google Sheets</h3>
To autofill a list of months in Google Sheets, simply type in two dates that are exactly one month apart in cells A1 and A2.
Then highlight both cell A1 and cell A2, then hover over the bottom right-hand corner of cell A2 until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears.
Then click and drag down to however many cells you’d like in the same column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fill5.png">
The result is a list of consecutive months.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Autofill Values from Another Sheet</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to autofill values from another sheet in Google Sheets.
<h3>Step 1: Enter Data in First Sheet</h3>
First, let’s enter the following data into <b>Sheet1</b> in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/another1.jpg"502">
<h3>Step 2: Autofill Data in Second Sheet</h3>
Now suppose we have another sheet titled <b>Sheet2</b> that contains the following data:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/another2.jpg"483">
Suppose we would like to autofill the values from the Points column in <b>Sheet1</b> into a Points column in <b>Sheet2</b>.
To do so, we can type the following formula in cell <b>C2</b> of <b>Sheet2</b>:
<b>=Sheet1!B2 </b>
This will automatically populate cell <b>C2</b> in <b>Sheet2</b> with the value from cell <b>B2</b> in <b>Sheet1</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/another4.jpg"481">
To autofill the rest of the values in column C, we can hover over the bottom right-hand corner of cell <b>C2</b> until a tiny “+” appears.
Then click and drag down to all of the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/another3.jpg"461">
Notice that all of the values from the Points column in <b>Sheet1</b> have been autofilled into <b>Sheet2</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Average by Group in Google Sheets</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate the average value by group in Google Sheets.
<h2>Example: Calculate Average by Group in Google Sheets</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset that shows the total points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/avggroup1.jpg"492">
Now suppose we’d like to find the average value of the points scored, grouped by team.
To do so, we can use the <b>UNIQUE()</b> function to first create a list of the unique teams.
We’ll type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(B2:B12)</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, a list of unique team names will be displayed:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/avggroup2.jpg"598">
Next, we can use the <b>=AVERAGEIF()</b> function to find the average of points scored by players on each team:
<b>=AVERAGEIF($B$2:$B$12, E2, $C$2:$C$12)
</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>F2</b> and copy and paste it down to each remaining cell in column F:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/avggroup3.jpg"665">
Column E displays each of the unique teams and column F displays the average value of the points scored by each team.
We can verify these results are correct by manually calculating the average for one of the teams.
For example, the average points scored by players on the Spurs team would be:
Average points by Spurs players: (13.7 + 12.7 + 22.4) / 3 = <b>12.26667</b>.
This matches the value calculated using the formula.
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>AVERAGEIF</b> formula in Google Sheets  here .

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Average by Month in Google Sheets</span></h2>
Often you may want to calculate the average value grouped by month in Google Sheets.
For example, suppose we have the following dataset and we’d like to calculate the average daily sales, grouped by month:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/avg1.jpg"481">
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, enter the data values into Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/avg1.jpg"481">
<h2>Step 2: Extract the Month from Dates</h2>
Next, we need to use the <b>=MONTH()</b> function to extract the month from each date.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>D2</b>:
<b>=MONTH(A2)
</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/avg2.jpg"625">
<h2>Step 3: Find the Unique Months</h2>
Next, we need to use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> function to produce a list of unique months.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>F2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(D2:D10)
</b>
This will produce a list of unique months:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/avg3.jpg"671">
<h2>Step 4: Calculate the Average by Month</h2>
Next, we will use the <b>AVERAGEIF(range, criterion, average_range)</b> function to find the average of the daily sales values, grouped by month.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>G2</b>:
<b>=AVERAGEIF($D$2:$D$10, F2, $B$2:$B$10)
</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to the remaining cells in column G:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/avg4.jpg">
This tells us:
The average daily sales value in January was <b>39</b>.
The average daily sales value in February was <b>25</b>.
The average daily sales value in March was <b>27.75</b>.

 How to Average Filtered Rows in Google Sheets 
 How to Calculate Average If Not Blank in Google Sheets 
<h2><span class="orange">How to Average Filtered Rows in Google Sheets (With Example)</span></h2>
The easiest way to take the average of a filtered range in Google Sheets is to use the following syntax:
<b>SUBTOTAL(101, A1:A10)
</b>
Note that the value 101 is a  shortcut  for taking the average of a filtered range of rows.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Average Filtered Rows in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following spreadsheet that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt1.png">
To add a filter to this data, we can highlight cells <b>A1:B10</b>, then click the <b>Data</b> tab, then click <b>Create a filter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt2.png">
We can then click the Filter icon at the top of the Points column and uncheck the box next to the first three values 84, 89, and 93:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt3.png">
Once we click <b>OK</b>, the data will be filtered to remove these values.
If we attempt to use the <b>AVERAGE()</b> function to average the points column of the filtered rows, it will not return the correct value:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/avgfilt1.jpg"477">
Instead, need to use the <b>SUBTOTAL()</b> function:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/avgfilt2.jpg">
This function takes the average of only the visible rows.
We can manually verify this by calculating the average of the visible rows:
Average of Visible Rows: (99 + 94 + 97 + 104 + 109 + 99) / 6 = <b>100.333</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Calculate Average If Cell Contains Text</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate the average in Google Sheets only for the cells that contain a specific text:
<b>=AVERAGEIF(A2:A13,"*text*",B2:B13)
</b>
This particular formula will calculate the average of the values in the range <b>B2:B13</b> only for the cells that contain “text” in the range <b>A2:A13</b>.
<b>Note</b>: The asterisks are wildcard characters that tell Google Sheets to ignore any text before or after a specific string.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Calculate Average If Cell Contains Text</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the points scored by 12 different basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/averagecontains1.jpg"409">
We can use the following formula to calculate the average points scored by players on any team with “avs” in the team name:
<b>=AVERAGEIF(A2:A13,"*avs*",B2:B13)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/avgcontain1.jpg">
The average points scored by players on a team with “avs” in the name is <b>22.75</b>.
In this particular example, there are two team names with “avs” in the name: Mavs and Cavs.
We can manually calculated the average points scored by players on these teams:
Average Points Scored = (31 + 23 + 21 +16) / 4= <b>22.75</b>.
This matches the value calculated by our formula.
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>AVERAGEIF </b>function in Google Sheets  here .

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Calculate Average if Greater Than Zero</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate the average in Google Sheets only for values that are greater than zero:
<b>=AVERAGEIF(B2:B14, ">0", B2:B14)
</b>
This particular formula calculates the average value in the range <b>B2:B14</b> only for the cells that have a value greater than zero.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Calculate Average if Greater than Zero in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the total sales made by various employees at a company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/avgg1.jpg"471">
If we simply used the <b>AVERAGE()</b> formula, we would find the average sales for all of the employees:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/avgg2.jpg"470">
The average sales per employee is <b>3.307</b>.
However, suppose we wanted to only calculate the average for employees who had greater than zero sales.
We could type the following formula into cell D2:
<b>=AVERAGEIF(B2:B14, ">0", B2:B14)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/avgg3.jpg">
The average sales for employees who had greater than zero sales was <b>4.3</b>.
This formula calculated the average by only using the values that were greater than zero.
We can confirm that this is correct by manually calculating the average of all values that are greater than zero:
Average of Values Greater than Zero: (10+4+4+3+9+2+1+1+4+5) / 10 = <b>4.3</b>.
This matches the value calculated by our formula.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Calculate Average If Not Blank</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate the average value of a range in Google Sheets only if every cell in the range is not blank:
<b>=IF(COUNT(A1:A10),AVERAGE(A1:A10),0)
</b>
This formula calculates the average value of cells in the range <b>A1:A10</b>. If every value in the range is blank, then the formula simply returns <b>0</b>.
You could also use the following formula to return a blank instead:
<b>=IF(COUNT(A1:A10),AVERAGE(A1:A10),"")</b>
The following examples show how to use these formulas in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Average If Not Blank (Return a Value)</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the average value in column B where there are only a few missing values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blank11.jpg"525">
Since there were only a few missing values, the formula simply returned the average of the non-missing values.
<h3>Example 2: Average If Not Blank (Return a Zero)</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the average value in column B where every single value is missing:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blank12.jpg"550">
Since every single value was missing in column B, the formula simply returned a value of 0.
<h3>Example 3: Average If Not Blank (Return a Blank)</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the average value in column B where every single value is missing:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blank13.jpg"554">
Since every single value was missing in column B, the formula simply returned a blank.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Average Percentage in Google Sheets</span></h2>
Often you may want to calculate an average percentage of some dataset.
Fortunately this is easy to do using built-in functions in Google Sheets.
This tutorial provides two examples of how to calculate an average percentage in different scenarios.
<h2>Example 1: Calculate Average Percentage with Percentages Only</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of percentages in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/perc11.jpg"508">
To calculate the average percentage, we can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b>:
<b>=AVERAGE(A2:A9)</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, the average percentage will be shown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/perc12.jpg">
We can see that the average percentage is <b>82%</b>.
<h2>Example 2: Calculate Average Percentage with Counts & Percentages</h2>
Suppose we administer a survey to parents, students, and teachers at a certain school and ask them if they would be in favor of a new school rule.
The following dataset shows the number of people who responded to the survey in each of the three groups along with the percentage of individuals in each group who are in favor of the new rule:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/perc13.jpg"563">
We can use the following formula to calculate the average percentage of individuals who are in favor of the new rule across all three groups:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(B2:B4, C2:C4)/SUM(B2:B4)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/perc14.jpg">
We can see that <b>58.33%</b> of total individuals are in favor of the new rule.
We can verify that this is correct by manually calculating how many people were in favor of the rule from each group and then dividing by the total number of people:
% in Favor from Students = 400 * 30% = 120.
% in Favor from Parents = 300 * 90% = 270.
% in Favor from Teachers = 50 * 95% = 47.5.
% All Individuals in Favor = (120+270+47.5) / 750 = <b>0.5833</b>.
This matches the average percentage that we calculated using the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> formula.

The y-axis label will automatically be modified on the chart:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/axislabel8.jpg"543">
The x-axis label is now <b>Period</b> and the y-axis label is now <b>Total Sales</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Make a Burndown Chart in Google Sheets</span></h2>
A <b>burndown chart</b> is a chart that shows the ideal “burndown” (i.e. completion) of tasks vs. the actual burndown of tasks at some company.
This type of chart can help teams and project managers determine if they’re working at a planned pace or not.
This tutorial provides a step-by-step example of how to create the following burndown chart in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/burn4.jpg">
Let’s jump in!
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset that shows the ideal burndown of tasks vs. the actual burndown of tasks by date:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/burn1.jpg"506">
<h2>Step 2: Insert the Burndown Chart</h2>
Next, highlight the cells in the range <b>A1:C15</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab, then click <b>Chart</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/burn2.jpg"527">
In the <b>Chart editor</b> panel that appears on the right side of the screen, choose <b>Line chart</b> as the Chart type:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/burn3.jpg"314">
The following chart will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/burn4.jpg">
Feel free to customize the title, the colors, the line style, and the axis labels to make the plot look however you’d like.
<h2>Step 3: Interpret the Burndown Chart</h2>
The blue line in the burndown chart represents the “ideal” burndown or the “planned” burndown of tasks.
The red line represents the “actual” burndown of tasks.
When the red line is above the blue line, the team is burning through tasks <b>slower</b> than planned and when the red line is below the blue line, the team is burning through tasks <b>faster</b> than planned.
From the burndown chart above we can see that the team is burning through tasks slower than the planned pace up until January 11.
After this point, the red line is below the blue line which means the team burns through the tasks quicker than the planned pace.
<b>Note</b>: In this example we used individual days for the x-axis but you could also use weekly intervals, bi-weekly intervals, or any other interval that is standard for your particular team or company.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Change Axis Scales in Google Sheets Plots</span></h2>
This tutorial provides a step-by-step example of how to change the axis scales on a plot in Google Sheets.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter a simple dataset into Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/scalesheets1.jpg"490">
<h3>Step 2: Create Plot</h3>
Next, highlight the cells in the range <b>A2:B16</b>. Then click the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon and then click <b>Chart</b>.
The following scatterplot will be created:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/scalesheets2.jpg"557">
<h3>Step 3: Change the Axis Scales</h3>
By default, Google Sheets will choose a scale for the x-axis and y-axis that ranges roughly from the minimum to maximum values in each column.
To change the scale of the x-axis, simply double click any value on the x-axis.
This will bring up the <b>Chart editor</b> panel on the right side of the screen.
Within this panel you can click the <b>Customize</b> tab, then click the dropdown arrow next to<b> Horizontal axis</b>, then check the box next to <b>Log scale</b> to convert the x-axis to a logarithmic scale:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/scalesheets3.jpg">
The x-axis will automatically be converted to a logarithmic scale:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/scalesheets4.jpg"542">
<b>Related:</b>  When Should You Use a Log Scale in Charts? 
You can also change the range of values for the x-axis.
For example, we could choose to make the maximum value on the x-axis equal to 100:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/scalesheets5.jpg">
The x-axis on the chart will automatically be updated:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/scalesheets6.jpg"540">
Note that in this example, we chose to change only the x-axis scale.
However, we can just as easily change the y-axis scale by clicking the dropdown arrow next to <b>Vertical axis</b> within the <b>Customize</b> tab of the <b>Chart editor</b> panel and performing the same steps as above.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Chart Data from Multiple Sheets</span></h2>
You can easily chart data from multiple sheets in Google Sheets by simply adding multiple ranges for <b>Series</b> in the <b>Chart editor</b> panel.
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset into <b>Sheet1</b> that shows the sales of various products at Store A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart1.jpg"598">
Next, we’ll enter the following dataset into <b>Sheet2</b> that shows the sales of the same products at Store B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart2.jpg"583">
<h2>Step 2: Create Initial Chart</h2>
Next, we’ll highlight the range <b>A2:B7</b> in <b>Sheet1</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab, then click <b>Chart</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart3.jpg"536">
In the <b>Chart editor</b> panel that appears, we’ll choose <b>Column chart</b> as the <b>Chart type</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart4.jpg"335">
This will produce the following chart that shows the sales of each product from <b>Sheet1</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart5.jpg"546">
<h2>Step 3: Add Data from Second Sheet to Chart</h2>
To add the sales data from <b>Sheet2</b> to the chart, click <b>Add Series</b> from the <b>Setup</b> tab within the <b>Chart editor</b> panel, then click the tiny grid icon:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart6.jpg"322">
In the new window that appears, type <b>Sheet2!B1:B7</b> for the data range:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart7.jpg"438">
Once you click <b>OK</b>, the sales data from <b>Sheet2</b> will be added to the chart:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chart8.jpg">
The blue bars represent the sales of each product from Store A and the red bars represent the sales of each product from Store B.
<b>Note #1</b>: This example assumes that the data is arranged the same way in each sheet.
<b>Note #2</b>: In this example, we created a chart using data from two sheets. However, you can add as many ranges for <b>Series</b> in the <b>Chart editor</b> panel as you’d like to create a chart using even more sheets.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Add Strikethrough When Checkbox is Checked</span></h2>
You can use the <b>custom formula</b> function in Google Sheets to add a strikethrough to specific cells when a checkbox is checked.
The following example shows how to use the custom formula function in practice.
<h2>Example: Conditional Formatting Based on Checkbox</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of basketball team names in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/checkbox11.jpg"522">
Now suppose we know that the following teams have been eliminated from the playoffs:
Mavs
Warriors
Hawks
Suns
Suppose we’d like to create a checkbox that, when checked, each of the teams that have been eliminated will have a strikethrough applied to their team name.
To do so, we need to first insert a checkbox by selecting cell <b>C2</b>, then clicking the <b>Insert</b> tab, then clicking <b>Checkbox</b>.
The following checkbox will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/checkbox13.jpg"500">
Next, click cell <b>A2</b>, then click the <b>Format</b> tab, then click <b>Conditional formatting</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/checkbox14.jpg"580">
In the <b>Conditional format rules</b> panel that appears on the right side of the screen, type the following cells in the box called <b>Apply to range</b>:
<b>A2,A5,A7,A10</b>
Then click the <b>Format cells if</b> dropdown, then choose <b>Custom formula is</b>, then type in the following formula:
<b>=C$2=TRUE
</b>
<b>Note</b>: It’s important that you include the equal sign (<b>=</b>) at the beginning of the formula, otherwise the conditional formatting won’t work.
Then, in the <b>Formatting style</b> box, click the icon that has a strikethrough symbol (to the right of the underline symbol).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/checkbox15.jpg"336">
Lastly, click <b>Done</b>.

<b>Method 1: Check if Dates are Equal</b>
<b>=A1=B1</b>
<b>Method 2: Check if Dates are Not Equal</b>
<b>=A1&lt;>B1</b>
<b>Method 3: Check if First Date is Greater than Second Date</b>
<b>=A1>B1</b>
<b>Method 4: Check if First Date is Less than Second Date</b>

</b>
The following example shows how to use each method in practice.
<h3>Example: Compare Dates in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have two columns in Google Sheets that each contain date values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comparedate1.jpg"431">
The following screenshot shows how to use the formulas defined earlier to compare the values in the date columns:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comparedate2.jpg">
Here’s how each formula works:
Column C: If the dates are equal, a value of <b>TRUE</b> is returned. Otherwise, <b>FALSE</b> is returned.
Column D: If the dates are not equal, a value of <b>TRUE</b> is returned. Otherwise, <b>FALSE</b> is returned.
Column E: If the first date is greater (i.e. later), a value of <b>TRUE</b> is returned. Otherwise, <b>FALSE</b> is returned.
Column F: If the first date is less (i.e. earlier), a value of <b>TRUE</b> is returned. Otherwise, <b>FALSE</b> is returned.
The following screenshot also shows how to use an <b>IFS()</b> function to determine which date is latest:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/comparedate3.jpg"651">
Note that these formulas will only work if the values in the first two columns are both formatted as dates.
To convert the values in each column to date, simply highlight all of the date values, then click the <b>Format</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click <b>Number</b>, then click <b>Date</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Compare Two Columns in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to compare two columns in Google Sheets to look for similarities and differences.
The following examples show how to make the following comparisons between two columns:
<b>1.</b> Compare Two Columns to Find Which Values are Equal
<b>2.</b> Compare Two Columns to Find Which Values are Greater / Less Than
<b>3.</b> Compare Two Columns to Find Which Values Belong to Both Columns
<h3>Example 1: Find Which Values are Equal</h3>
We can use the following syntax to compare values across two columns and find which values are equal:
<b>=IF(A1=B1, "Yes", "No")
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this syntax in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/compare1.png">
This allows us to quickly see which values match in each row between the two columns.
<h3>Example 2: Find Which Values are Greater & Less Than</h3>
We can use the following syntax to compare values across two columns and find which values are greater:
<b>=IF(A1>B1, "Team 1", "Team 2")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this syntax in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/compare2.png">
This allows us to quickly see which team scored more points in each row.

Suppose we have the following two columns and we want to find which values in column B also belong to column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/compare3.png">
We can use Conditional formatting to accomplish this.
First, highlight cells <b>B2:B13</b>. Then click the <b>Format</b> tab and then click <b>Conditional formatting</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/compare4-1.png">
In the <b>Conditional format rules</b> panel that appears on the right side of the screen, click the dropdown menu next to <b>Format cells if…</b> and scroll to the bottom of the list and click <b>Custom formula is</b>.
Then enter the following formula:
<b>=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$13,B2)>0</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/compare5-1.png">
Once you click <b>Done</b>, the conditional formatting will be applied to column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/compare6.png">
Notice that each value in column B that also appears in column A is highlighted.
Note that you can also change the color used for highlighting in the <b>Conditional format rules</b> panel.
For example, we could change the highlighting color to orange:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Use CONCATENATE with a Space</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to concatenate strings with a space in Google Sheets:
<b>=CONCATENATE(A2, " ", B2)
</b>
This particular formula will concatenate the strings in cells <b>A2</b> and <b>B2</b> with a space in between the strings.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Concatenate Strings with Space in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains the city location and team name of various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/concat1.jpg"487">
If we use the following <b>CONCATENATE</b> function to concatenate the city and team names into one cell, no space will be added by default:
<b>=CONCATENATE(A2, B2)
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/concat2.jpg"514">
To concatenate with a space, we must explicitly use a space:
<b>=CONCATENATE(A2, " ", B2)</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/concat3.jpg">
Notice that the city and team names have been concatenated with a space.
If we’d like, we can also add additional text to any location in the string.
For example, we can include “Team: ” in the <b>CONCATENATE</b> function:
<b>=CONCATENATE("Team: ", A2, " ", B2)
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/concat4.jpg"565">
Feel free to include as many strings and as many variables as you’d like in the <b>CONCATENATE</b> function, each separated by a comma.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Convert Date to Number in Google Sheets (3 Examples)</span></h2>
This tutorial explains how to convert a date to a number in three different scenarios:
<b>1.</b> Convert One Date to Number
<b>2.</b> Convert Several Dates to Numbers
<b>3.</b> Convert Date to Number of Days Since Another Date
Let’s jump in!
<h2>Example 1: Convert One Date to Number</h2>
Suppose we would like to convert the date “4/10/2022” to a number in Google Sheets.
We can use the <b>DATEVALUE</b> function in Excel to do so:
<b>=DATEVALUE("4/10/2022")
</b>
By default, this function calculates the number of days between a given date and <b>1/1/1900</b>.
The following screenshot shows how to use this function in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/convertdate1.jpg">
This tells us that there is a difference of <b>44,661</b> days between 4/10/2022 and 1/1/1900.
<h2>Example 2: Convert Several Dates to Numbers</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of dates in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/convertdate2.jpg"480">
To convert each of these dates to a number, we can highlight the range of cells that contain the dates, then click the <b>Format</b> tab, then click <b>Number</b> from the dropdown menu, then click <b>Automatic</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/convertdate3.jpg">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/convertdate4.jpg"475">
<h2>Example 3: Convert Date to Number of Days Since Another Date</h2>
We can use the following formula to convert a date to a number of days since another date:
<b>=DATEDIF(B2, A2, "d")
</b>
This particular formula calculates the number of days between the date in cell <b>B2</b> and the date in cell <b>A2</b>.
The following screenshot shows how to use the <b>DATEDIF</b> formula to calculate the number of days between the dates in column A and 1/1/2022:

Note that each formula assumes the date is in cell <b>A1</b>.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice.
<h2>Example 1: Convert Date to Quarter Only </h2>
We can use the following formula to convert a date to a quarter only:
<b>="Q" &INT((MONTH(A2)+2)/3)</b>
We can type this formula into cell B2 and drag the formula down to every remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/quarter1.jpg"487">
The quarter for each date in column A is shown in column B.
<h2>Example 2: Convert Date to Quarter and Year</h2>
We can use the following formula to convert a date to a quarter and year:
<b>="Q" &INT((MONTH(A2)+2)/3) & "-" & YEAR(A2)</b>

<b>Method 1: Convert Date to String </b>
<b>=TEXT(A1, "mm-dd-yyyy")
</b>
<b>Method 2: Convert Datetime to String</b>
<b>=TEXT(A1,"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss")
</b>
The following examples show how to use these formulas in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Convert Date to String in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following list of dates in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/datesheet1.jpg"486">
We can use the following formula to convert the date in cell A1 to a string:

We can then copy and paste this formula down to the remaining cells in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/datesheet2.jpg"474">
All of the cells in column B are now a string.
To verify this, we can type <b>=ISTEXT(A2)</b> and <b>=ISTEXT(B2)</b> to check if the values in cells A2 and B2 are strings, respectively:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/datesheet3.jpg"459">
We can see that the value in cell A2 is not a string since the<b> ISTEXT()</b> function returned <b>FALSE</b>.
Conversely, we can see that the value in cell B2 is a string since the<b> ISTEXT()</b> function returned <b>TRUE</b>.
<h3>Example 2: Convert Datetime to String in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following list of datetimes in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/datesheet4.jpg"511">
We can use the following formula to convert the datetime in cell A1 to a string:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Convert Minutes to Hours</span></h2>
Often you may want to convert minutes to hours in Google Sheets.
Fortunately this is easy to do and this tutorial explains how to make the following conversions in Google Sheets:
<b>1.</b> Convert Minutes to Hours
<b>2.</b> Convert Minutes to Hours & Minutes
The following examples show how to make each of these conversions in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hours11.jpg"480">
<h2>Example 1: Convert Minutes to Hours in Google Sheets</h2>
To convert hours to minutes in Google Sheets, we simply need to divide the minutes by 60.
To do so, we can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b>:
<b>=B2/60</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hours2.jpg">
Column C now displays the minutes in column B in terms of hours.
For example:
30 minutes is equal to <b>0.5</b> hours.
35 minutes is equal to <b>0.5833</b> hours.
71 minutes is equal to <b>1.1833</b> hours.
And so on.
<h2>Example 2: Convert Minutes to Hours & Minutes in Google Sheets</h2>
To convert hours to hours and minutes in Google Sheets, we need to use two steps.
<b>Step 1: Divide Minutes by 1440 </b>
First, we need to divide the minutes by 1440.
To do so, we can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b>:
<b>=B2/1440</b>

<h2><span class="orange">How to Count Duplicates in Google Sheets (With Example)</span></h2>
Often you may want to count duplicate values in Google Sheets.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>COUNTIF()</b> function.
The following example shows how to count duplicate values for the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dup5.jpg"491">
Let’s jump in!
<h2>Example: Count Duplicates in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains the names of various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dup1.jpg"481">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>B2</b> to generate a list of unique team names from column A:

The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dup2.jpg"487">
We can then type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b> to count the number of duplicate values for the Mavs team:
<b>=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$14, B2) - 1</b>
We can then click and drag this formula down to each remaining cell in column C to count the number of duplicate values for each team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dup3.jpg"487">
From the output we can see:
Mavs have <b>3</b> duplicate values.
Warriors have <b>2</b> duplicate values.
Hawks have <b>1</b> duplicate value.
Kings have <b>0</b> duplicate values.
And so on.
Note that his formula counts how many times each unique value occurs and then subtracts one.
Thus, if a team name only occurs once, then the formula returns <b>0</b> to indicate that the team has 0 duplicate values.
If you’d like to calculate the total number of duplicate values in the entire dataset, you can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b>:
<b>=SUM(C2:C8)</b>

<h2><span class="orange">How to Count Filtered Rows in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
The easiest way to count the number of filtered rows in Google Sheets is to use the following syntax:
<b>SUBTOTAL(102, A1:A10)
</b>
Note that the value 102 is a  shortcut  for taking the count of a filtered range of rows.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Count Filtered Rows in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following spreadsheet that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt1.png">
To add a filter to this data, we can highlight cells <b>A1:B10</b>, then click the <b>Data</b> tab, then click <b>Create a filter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt2.png">
We can then click the Filter icon at the top of the Points column and uncheck the box next to the first three values 84, 89, and 93:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt3.png">
Once we click <b>OK</b>, the data will be filtered to remove these values.
If we attempt to use the <b>COUNT()</b> function to count the number of filtered rows, the value will not be correct:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/countfiltersheets1.jpg"473">
The number of filtered rows is 6, but the <b>COUNT()</b> function returns 7.
Instead, we need to use the <b>SUBTOTAL()</b> function:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/countfiltersheets2.jpg"474">
This function only counts the number of visible rows.
We can manually verify this is correct by observing that there are 6 visible rows.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Count Number of Occurrences in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> and <b>=COUNTIF()</b> functions to count the number of occurrences of different values in a column in Google Sheets.

<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the names for some professional basketball teams in column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/occur1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Find the Unique Values in the Column</h3>
Next, let’s use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> function to create a list of every unique team name in column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/occur2.png">
Note that this function creates an array of unique values by default.
<h3>Step 3: Count the Occurrence of Each Unique Value</h3>
Next, let’s use the <b>=COUNTIF()</b> function to count the number of occurrences of each unique team name:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/occur3.png">
Note that we simply copy and pasted the formula in cell E2 to each of the remaining cells in column E.
From the output we can see:
The team name ‘Hornets’ occurs <b>1</b> time in column A.
The team name ‘Hawks’ occurs <b>3</b> times in column A.
The team name ‘Spurs’ occurs <b>5</b> times in column A.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Count Rows with Value in Google Sheets (3 Examples)</span></h2>

<h2><span class="orange">How to Use Count Unique IF Function in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following methods to count unique values based on criteria in Google Sheets:
<b>Method 1: Count Unique Values Based on One Criteria</b>
<b>=COUNTUNIQUEIFS(A2:A10, C2:C10, ">30")
</b>
This particular formula counts the number of unique values in the range <b>A2:A10</b> where the corresponding value in the range <b>C2:C10</b> is greater than 30.
<b>Method 2: Count Unique Values Based on Multiple Criteria</b>
<b>=COUNTUNIQUEIFS(A2:A10, B2:B10, "Forward", C2:C10, "&lt;20")
</b>
This particular formula counts the number of unique values in the range <b>A2:A10</b> where the corresponding value in the range <b>B2:B10</b> is equal to “Forward” and the value in the range <b>C2:C10</b> is less than 20.
The following examples shows how to use each method in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ci1.jpg"503">
<h2>Example 1: Count Unique Values Based on One Criteria</h2>
We can use the following formula to count the unique values in the <b>Team</b> column only where the corresponding values in the <b>Points</b> column is greater than 30:
<b>=COUNTUNIQUEIFS(A2:A10, C2:C10, ">30")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ci2.jpg">
The output tells us that there are only <b>2</b> unique values in the <b>Team</b> column where the corresponding value in the <b>Points</b> column is greater than 30.
If we look at the original dataset we can see that there are 3 rows where the value in the <b>Points</b> column is greater than 30, but there are only two unique team names among those 3 rows: Mavs and Spurs.
This is why the <b>COUNTUNIQUEIFS</b> formula returns a value of <b>2</b>.
<h2>Example 2: Count Unique Values Based on Multiple Criteria</h2>
We can use the following formula to count the unique values in the <b>Team</b> column only where the corresponding values in the <b>Position</b> column is “Forward” and the value in the <b>Points</b> column is less than 20:
<b>=COUNTUNIQUEIFS(A2:A10, B2:B10, "Forward", C2:C10, "&lt;20")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:

<h2><span class="orange">How to Count Unique Values in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to count the number of unique values in Google Sheets.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>COUNTUNIQUE()</b> function.
The following examples show how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Count Unique Values in One Column</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to use the <b>COUNTUNIQUE()</b> function to count the number of unique team names in column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unique1.png">
There are <b>6</b> unique team names in column A.
<h3>Example 2: Count Unique Values in Multiple Columns</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to use the <b>COUNTUNIQUE()</b> function to count the number of unique team names in column A and column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unique2.png">
There are <b>13</b> unique team names in column A and column B.
<h3>Example 3: Count Occurrences of Unique Values</h3>
To count how often each unique value occurs, you can first use the <b>UNIQUE()</b> function to display a list of unique team names:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unique3.png">
You can then use the <b>COUNTIF()</b> function to count how often each unique team name occurs in column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unique4-1.png">
From the output we can see:
Mavericks occurs <b>2</b> times.
Hornets occurs <b>3</b> times.
Nets occur <b>1</b> time.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Create a Countdown Timer in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can create a countdown timer in Google Sheets that counts the number of days, hours, and minutes until some date by using the <b>NOW()</b> function.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this function to create a countdown timer in practice.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Countdown Date</h3>
Suppose today is <b>2/3/2022</b>.
I will create a countdown timer in Google Sheets that counts the number of days, hours, and minutes until <b>2/10/2022</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countdown1.jpg"505">
<h3>Step 2: Create the Formulas for Counting Down</h3>
Next, we can use the following formulas to count the number of days, hours, and minutes until 2/10/2022:
<b>Days</b>: =INT(A2-NOW())
<b>Hours</b>: =HOUR(A2-NOW())
<b>Minutes</b>: =MINUTE(A2-NOW())
We can type these formulas into each of their own cells:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countdown2.jpg">
This tells us that the date 2/10/22 is <b>6</b> days, <b>12</b> hours, and <b>42</b> minutes away.
<h3>Step 3: Update the Countdown Timer Every Minute</h3>
To ensure that the values for the countdown timer update every minute, click the <b>File</b> tab along the top ribbon and then click <b>Settings</b> from the dropdown menu:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countdown3.jpg"406">
Next, click the <b>Calculation</b> tab and then click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Recalculation</b> and choose <b>On change and every minute</b> and then click <b>Save settings</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countdown4.jpg"573">
The countdown timer will now automatically update the values for the days, hours, and minutes every single minute.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Count Cells Between Two Values</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to count the number of cells between two values in Google Sheets:
<b>=COUNTIFS(A:A,">10",A:A,"&lt;15")
</b>
This particular formula counts the number of cells in column <b>A</b> that are greater than <b>10</b> or less than <b>15</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Count Cells Between Two Values in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following data in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countbetween1.jpg"530">
We can use the following formula to count the number of cells in column <b>B</b> that have a value greater than <b>10</b> and less than <b>20</b>:
<b>=COUNTIFS(B:B,">10",B:B,"&lt;20")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countbetween2.jpg"473">
There are <b>4</b> points values that are greater than 10 <em>and</em> less than 20.
We can manually count each of these four values in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countbetween3.jpg"472">
Note that we can also use <b>>=</b> and<b> &lt;=</b> in the formula to count the values between 10 and 20, <b>inclusive</b>:
<b>=COUNTIFS(B:B,">=10",B:B,"&lt;=20")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countbetween4.jpg"476">
There are <b>6</b> points values that are greater than or equal to 10 <em>and</em> less than or equal to 20.
We can manually count each of these six values in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countbetween5.jpg"469">
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>COUNTIFS </b>function in Google Sheets  here .
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: COUNTIF Greater Than Zero</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to count the number of cells that are greater than zero in Google Sheets:
<b>=COUNTIF(B2:B11, ">0")
</b>
This particular formula counts the number of cells in the range <b>B2:B11</b> that have a value greater than zero.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: COUNTIF Greater Than Zero in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the number of sales made by various employees at a company during a given month:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/greater1.jpg"481">
We can use the following formula to count the number of employees who made more than zero sales:
<b>=COUNTIF(B2:B11, ">0")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/greater2.jpg"488">
We can see that <b>6</b> employees had more than zero sales.
We can confirm this by manually identifying each of these employees:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/greater3.jpg"500">
If you would like to count the number of cells in a range that are <b>equal to or greater than zero</b>, simply use the following formula:
<b>=COUNTIF(B2:B11, ">=0")</b>
<h2>Additional Resources</h2>

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Use COUNTIF with Multiple Ranges</span></h2>
The <b>COUNTIFS()</b> function in Google Sheets can be used to count the number of rows in a spreadsheet that meet multiple criteria.
This function uses the following syntax:
<b>COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criterion1, criteria_range2, criterion2, …)</b>
where:
<b>criteria_range1</b>: The first range of cells to look in.
<b>criterion1</b>: The criterion to look for in the first range of cells.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Using COUNTIFS in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the team and average points scored for seven different basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/countif1.png">
We can use the following <b>COUNTIFS()</b> function to count the number of players who play for the Lakers <em>and</em> who score 20 or more points per game:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/countif2.png">
The total number of players that meet these two criteria is <b>2</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/countif3.png">
Specifically we can see that player “D” and “E” meet these two criteria.
Note that in this example we only used the <b>COUNTIFS()</b> function with two cell ranges, but we can use this function with any number of cell ranges that we’d like.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to COUNTIF Not Equal to Text</span></h2>
You can use the following formula in Google Sheets to count the number of cells that are not equal to a specific text:
<b>=COUNTIF(A2:A11, "&lt;>some_string")
</b>
This particular formula counts the number of cells in the range <b>A2:A12</b> that are not equal to “some_string.”
<b>Note</b>: The <b>&lt;></b> operator stands for “not equal” in Google Sheets.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: COUNTIF Not Equal to Text in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/not11.jpg"469">
We can use the following formula to count the number of cells in the <b>Team</b> column that are not equal to “Hawks”:
<b>=COUNTIF(A2:A12,"&lt;>Hawks")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/not12.jpg">
From the output we can see that there are 8 cells not equal to “Hawks” in the <b>Team</b> column.
If you would like to count the number of cells not equal to several different text, you can instead use the COUNTIFS function.
For example, we can use the following formula to count the number of cells in the <b>Team</b> column that are not equal to “Hawks” or “Spurs”:
<b>=COUNTIFS(A2:A12,"&lt;>Hawks", A2:A12, "&lt;>Spurs")
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/not13-1.jpg"598">
From the output we can see that there are 6 cells not equal to “Hawks” or “Spurs” in the <b>Team</b> column.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Use COUNTIFS with a Date Range in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to count the number of cell values that fall in a date range in Google Sheets:
<b>=COUNTIFS(A2:A11,">="&D2, A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)
</b>
This formula counts the number of cells in the range A2:A11 where the start date is equal to or greater than the date in cell D2 and the end date is equal to or less than the date in cell E2.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Use COUNTIFS with Date Range in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the number of products sold on various days:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/countifs1.png">
We can define a start and end date in cells D2 and E2 respectively, then use the following formula to count how many dates fall within the start and end date:
<b>=COUNTIFS(A2:A11,">="&D2, A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/countifs2.png">
We can see that <b>3</b> days fall in between the range 1/10/2021 and 1/15/2021.
We can manually verify that the following three dates in column A fall in this range:
1/12/2021
1/14/2021
1/15/2021
If we change either the start or end date, the formula will automatically update to count the cells within the new date range.
For example, suppose we change the start date to 1/1/2021:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/countifs3.png">
We can see that <b>8</b> days fall between the range 1/1/2021 and 1/15/2021.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Cumulative Percentage in Google Sheets</span></h2>
A <b>cumulative percentage</b> represents the total percentage of values in a dataset up to a certain point.
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate cumulative percentages in Google Sheets.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s create a dataset that shows the number of products that some company sells during consecutive years:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cumu1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Calculate Cumulative Frequency</h3>
Next, let’s use the following formula to calculate the cumulative frequency of the first row:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cumu2.png">
We can then copy and paste this formula to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cumu3.png">
<h3>Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Percentage</h3>
Next, we can use the following formula to calculate the cumulative percentage of the first row:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cumu4.png">
We can then copy and paste this formula to the remaining cells in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cumu5.png">
<h3>Step 4: Change Formatting to Percentage</h3>
Lastly, we can highlight each of the cumulative percentage values in column D and then press <b>Ctrl+Shift+%</b> to convert the formatting to percentages:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cumu6.png">
We interpret the cumulative percentages as follows:
<b>5.6%</b> of all products were sold in year 1.
<b>12.59%</b> of all products were sold in years 1 and 2 combined.
<b>19.78%</b> of all products were sold in years 1, 2, and 3 combined.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Add Custom Data Labels in Google Sheets</span></h2>
Often you may want to add custom data labels to charts in Google Sheets.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>Add labels </b>feature in Google Sheets.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Day of the Year in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to calculate the day of the year in Google Sheets:
<b>Formula 1: Calculate Day of the Year for Today</b>
<b>=TODAY()-DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),1,0)</b>
This formula will return the day of the year for the current day.
<b>Formula 2: Calculate Day of the Year for Date in Cell</b>
<b>=A2-DATE(YEAR(A2),1,1)+1</b>
This formula will return the day of the year for the date in cell A2.
<b>Formula 3: Calculate Date for Day of the Year</b>
<b>=DATE(2022,1,0)+A2</b>
This formula will return the date that corresponds to the day of the year in cell A2.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice.
<h2>Example 1: Calculate Day of the Year for Today</h2>
This article was written on 11/2/2022. To find the day of the year for today, we can type the following formula into Google Sheets:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Calculate Days Between Date and Today</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to calculate the number of days between a given date and today in Google Sheets:
<b>=DATEDIF(A1, Today(), "D") </b>
This particular formula calculates the number of days between today and the date in cell <b>A1</b>.
<b>Note</b>: The “D” tells Google Sheets to calculate the difference in days as opposed to some other unit of measurement like “M” for months or “Y” for years.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Calculate Days Between Date and Today in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sumyear1.jpg"504">
Note that this article is currently being written on <b>7/26/2022</b>.
Thus, I can type the following formula into cell C2 to calculate the difference between the date in cell A2 and today:
<b>=DATEDIF(A2, Today(), "D") </b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/date1.jpg">
Column C now displays the number of days between today and the dates in column A.
For example:
There are <b>937</b> days between 7/26/2022 and 1/1/2020.
There are <b>813</b> days between 7/26/2022 and 5/4/2020.
There are <b>772 </b>days between 7/26/2022 and 6/14/2020.
There are <b>600 </b>days between 7/26/2022 and 12/3/2020.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Use “Does Not Equal” in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
In Google Sheets, we use “<b>&lt;></b>” as the “<b>does not equal</b>” symbol in formulas.
For example, we can use the following formula to determine if the value in cell A2 is equal to “Guard”:
<b>=A2&lt;>"Guard"
</b>
If the value in cell A2 is not equal to “Guard” then the formula will return <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, the formula will return <b>FALSE</b>.
We can also use the “<b>&lt;></b>” symbol to determine if two cell values are not equal. For example, we can use the following formula to determine if the value in cells B2 and C2 are not equal:
<b>=B2&lt;>C2</b>
If the values in B2 and C2 are not equal, then the formula will return <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it will return <b>FALSE</b>.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example 1: Use “Does Not Equal” with String</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/notequal1.jpg"486">
We can use the following formula to determine if the value in the Position column is equal to “Guard” in each row:
<b>=A2&lt;>"Guard"</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/notequal2.jpg"642">
The formula in the first row returns <b>FALSE</b> because the value in the Position column actually is equal to “Guard.”
However, the formula in the last row returns <b>TRUE</b> because the value in the Position column is not equal to “Guard.”
<h2>Example 2: Use “Does Not Equal” to Compare Cell Values</h2>
Once again suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/notequal1.jpg"486">
We can use the following formula to determine if the value in column B and column C is not equal in each row:
<b>=B2&lt;>C2</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/notequal3.jpg"654">
The formula in the first row returns <b>TRUE </b>because the Game 1 points value and Game 2 points value are indeed not equal.
However, the formula in the second row returns <b>FALSE </b>because the Game 1 points value and Game 2 points value are actually equal.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Escape Quotes in Google Sheets (With Example)</span></h2>
There are two ways to escape quotes in formulas in Google Sheets:
<b>Method 1: Wrap Quotes Around Quotes</b>
<b>=CONCATENATE("""",A2,"""")
</b>
<b>Method 2: Use CHAR(34)</b>
<b>=CONCATENATE(CHAR(34),A2,CHAR(34))</b>
Both of these formulas will wrap the string in cell <b>A2</b> in double quotes.
<b>Note</b>: The function <b>CHAR(34)</b> corresponds to double quotes in the current Unicode table.
The following examples show how to use each method in practice with the following list of strings in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/quote1.jpg"521">
<h2>Example 1: Wrap Quotes Around Quotes</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>B2</b> to wrap the string in cell <b>A2</b> in double quotes:
<b>=CONCATENATE("""",A2,"""")</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/quote2.jpg">
Notice that each cell in column B contains the corresponding cell in column A with double quotes wrapped around it.
<h2>Example 2: Use CHAR(34)</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>B2</b> to wrap the string in cell <b>A2</b> in double quotes:
<b>=CONCATENATE(CHAR(34),A2,CHAR(34))</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/quote3.jpg"516">
Notice that each cell in column B contains the corresponding cell in column A with double quotes wrapped around it.
Note that the function <b>CHAR(34)</b> corresponds to double quotes in the current Unicode table.
Thus, this formula concatenates one double quote at the beginning of the string in column A, then concatenates another double quote at the end of the string.
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>CHAR </b>function in Google Sheets  here .

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Exclude Cell from Range in Formulas</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to exclude a cell from a range when using a formula in Google Sheets:
<b>=SUM(FILTER(B2:B11,B2:B11&lt;>B5))
</b>
This particular formula will calculate the sum of the values in the range <b>B2:B11</b> and exclude cell <b>B5</b> from the calculation.
The <b>&lt;></b> symbol in Google Sheets stands for “not equal.” In this formula we first filter the range to include all cells not equal to B5, then we calculate the sum of the remaining cells.
To perform a different calculation, simply replace SUM with another function such as AVERAGE or COUNT.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Exclude Cell from Range in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/exclude1.jpg"502">
We can use the following formula to calculate the sum of values in the <b>Points</b> column, excluding the value for the player named Derrick:
<b>=SUM(FILTER(B2:B11,B2:B11&lt;>B5))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/exclude2.jpg">
From the output we can see that the sum of the values in the <b>Points</b> column excluding Derrick is <b>218</b>.
We can confirm this is correct by manually calculating the sum of each value in the <b>Points</b> column excluding Derrick:
Sum of Points (Excluding Derrick) = 22 + 28 + 14 + 37 + 35 + 28 + 22 + 14 + 18 = 218.
To exclude multiple cells from a range, simply use multiple <b>&lt;></b> symbols in the formula.
For example, we can use the following formula to calculate the sum of the values in the <b>Points</b> column excluding both Derrick and Frank:
<b>=SUM(FILTER(B2:B11,B2:B11&lt;>B5,B2:B11&lt;>B7))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/exclude3.jpg">
The sum of the values in the <b>Points</b> column excluding both Derrick and Frank is <b>183</b>.
We can also replace SUM with a different function.
For example, we can use the following formula to calculate the average of the values in the <b>Points</b> column excluding both Derrick and Frank:
<b>=AVERAGE(FILTER(B2:B11,B2:B11&lt;>B5,B2:B11&lt;>B7))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/exclude4.jpg"601">
The average of the values in the <b>Points</b> column excluding both Derrick and Frank is <b>22.875</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Extract Month from Date in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to extract the month from a date in Google Sheets:
<b>=TEXT(A1, "MMMM")
</b>
This particular formula will return the month from the date in cell <b>A1</b>, formatted as the full month name such as “August.”
Note that you can also use the following abbreviations to return the month formatted in a different way:
<b>M</b>: Month of the year as one or two digits (8)
<b>MM</b>: Month of the year as two digits (08)
<b>MMM</b>: Month of the year as short name (Aug)
<b>MMMM</b>: Month of the year as full name (August)
<b>MMMMM</b>: First letter of the Month (A)
The following example shows how to use these functions in practice.
<h3>Example: Extract Month from Date in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following list of dates in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/monthg1.jpg"520">
We can use the following formulas to extract the month from each date using different formats:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/monthg2.jpg">
 
The values in column <b>B</b> display the month of the date in column A as 1 or 2 digits.
The values in column <b>C</b> display the month of the date in column A as 2 digits.
The values in column <b>D</b> display the month of the date in column A as the short name.
The values in column <b>E</b> display the month of the date in column A as the full name.
The values in column <b>F</b> display the month of the date in column A as the first letter of the month.
For this particular example, we formatted the dates as 1/1/2022 but the <b>TEXT()</b> function can also easily handle dates in different formats such as:
1/1/22
2022-01-01
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>TEXT()</b> function  here .
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Extract Numbers from String</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to extract numbers from a string in Google Sheets:
<b>=REGEXEXTRACT(A1,"-*\d*\.?\d+")
</b>
This formula will extract integers, decimals, and negative signs from a string.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Extract Numbers from String in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following list of strings in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/extract1.jpg"486">
We can use the following formula to extract numbers (including integers, decimals, and negative signs) from the strings:
<b>=REGEXEXTRACT(A2,"-*\d*\.?\d+")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/extract2.jpg">
Notice that the values in column B only contain the integers, decimals, and negative signs from the values in column A.
If you ever attempt to use this formula and you receive <b>#VALUE!</b> as a result, make sure that the strings are formatted as Plain text.
To convert the strings to Plain text, highlight the cell range that contains the strings, then click the <b>Format</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click <b>Number</b> and then click <b>Plain text</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/extract3.jpg"679">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Fill Series in Google Sheets (4 Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to fill in a series with values in Google Sheets. Fortunately this is easy to do using the simple drag and fill feature built into Google Sheets.
This tutorial explains how to fill a series in four different scenarios:
<b>1.</b> Fill a Series of Numbers
<b>2.</b> Fill a Series of Letters
<b>3.</b> Fill a Series of Days
<b>4.</b> Fill a Series of Months
<h3>Example 1: Fill a Series of Numbers</h3>
To fill a series of numbers in Google Sheets, simply enter the value of the first two numbers:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fillgoogle1.jpg"475">
Then hover over the bottom right-hand corner of the cell until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears. Then click and drag down to however many cells you’d like in the same column: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fillgoogle2.jpg">
Google Sheets will automatically detect the pattern between the first two numbers (e.g. add one value) and simply repeat this pattern for as many values as you’d like.
<h3>Example 2: Fill a Series of Letters</h3>
To fill a series of letters in Google Sheets, type in the first letter in some cell and then use the following formula to increment the letter by one:
<b>=CHAR(CODE(A2)+1)
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fillgoogle3.jpg">
Then hover over the bottom right-hand corner of the cell until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears. Then click and drag down to however many cells you’d like in the same column: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fillgoogle4.jpg"454">
A series of letters will automatically be filled in.
<h3>Example 3: Fill a Series of Days</h3>
To fill a series of days in Google Sheets, simply enter the date of the first day:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fillgoogle5.jpg"487">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Filter by List of Values in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to filter a dataset by a list of values in Google Sheets:
<b>=FILTER(A2:C11,COUNTIF(E2:E5,A2:A11))
</b>
This particular formula filters the cells in the range<b> A2:C11</b> to only return the rows where cells in the range <b>A2:A11</b> contain a value from the list of values in the range <b>E2:E5</b>.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list1.jpg"600">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list2.jpg"637">
<h2>Step 3: Filter by List of Values</h2>
Next, let’s type the following formula into cell <b>A14</b> to filter the dataset by the list of teams we defined:
<b>=FILTER(A2:C11,COUNTIF(E2:E5,A2:A11))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list3-1.jpg">
Notice that the filtered dataset only contains the rows where the Team names from original dataset in the range <b>A2:C11</b> are in the list of names in the range <b>E2:E5</b>.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>FILTER</b> function is case-insensitive. This means if you type “nets” instead of “Nets”, the function will still return the row with the “Nets” in the Team column.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Filter for Cells that Contain Text</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to filter for cells that contain certain text in Google Sheets:
<b>=FILTER(A1:C17, REGEXMATCH(A1:A17, "East"))
</b>
This formula filters the cells in the range A1:C17 to only return the rows where cells in the range A1:A17 contain the word “East”.
You can also use the following syntax to filter for cells that contain one of several values in Google Sheets:
<b>=FILTER(A1:C17, REGEXMATCH(A1:A17, "East|West"))</b>
This formula filters the cells in the range A1:C17 to only return the rows where cells in the range A1:A17 contain the word “East” or “West”.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Filter for Cells that Contain Text</h3>
Suppose we have the following data in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/filterText1.png">
We can use the following formula to filter for rows where the Region is equal to “East”.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/filterText2.png">
Notice that only the rows where the Region is equal to “East” are returned.

<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the following data that shows the sales for various products by date:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/filterDate1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Filter by Date Range</h3>
Now suppose we’d like to apply a filter to only show the rows where the date is between 1/5/2020 and 1/15/2020.
To do so, click cell <b>A1</b> and then click the <b>Data</b> tab and then click <b>Create a filter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/filterDate2.png">
Next, click the Filter icon next to <b>Date</b>. Then click <b>Filter by condition</b> and click <b>None</b>.
In the dropdown menu, click <b>Is between</b> and then type in 1/5/2020 and 1/15/2020:

Once you click <b>OK</b>, a filter will automatically be applied to only show the rows where the date is between 1/5/2020 and 1/15/2020:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/filterDate4.png">
To remove this filter, simply click the <b>Data</b> tab and then click <b>Turn off filter</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Filter from Another Sheet</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to filter data from another sheet in Google Sheets:
<b>=FILTER(All_Teams!A2:C11, All_Teams!B2:B11="Western")
</b>
This particular function will return all rows in the range <b>A2:C11</b> from the sheet titled <b>All_Teams</b> where the values in the range <b>B2:B11</b> are equal to “Western.”
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Filter from Another Sheet in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following sheet named <b>All_Teams </b>in Google Sheets that contains some data about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/filteranother1.jpg"499">
Now suppose we’d like to switch to the sheet titled <b>Specific_Teams </b>and only display the teams from <b>All_Teams</b> that are in the Western conference.
We can use the following syntax to do so:
<b>=FILTER(All_Teams!A2:C11, All_Teams!B2:B11="Western")</b>
Here’s how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/filteranother2-1.jpg"584">
Notice that this <b>FILTER</b> function returns all rows from the <b>All_Teams</b> sheet where the conference column is equal to “Western.”
<h3>Potential Error #1: Mismatched Range Sizes</h3>
When using the <b>FILTER</b> function, you may receive an error if you use two ranges that are not of equal size.
For example, suppose we use the following FILTER function:
<b>=FILTER(All_Teams!A1:C11, All_Teams!B2:B11="Western")</b>
The first range <b>A1:C11</b> does not contain the same number of rows as the second range <b>B2:B11</b>, so we’ll receive how an error:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/filteranother3.jpg"576">
To fix this error, simply make sure the two ranges contain the same number of rows.
<h3>Potential Error #2: Using Single Quotes</h3>
When using the <b>FILTER</b> function, you may receive an error if you use single quotes instead of double quotes.
For example, suppose we use the following FILTER function:
<b>=FILTER(All_Teams!A1:C11, All_Teams!B2:B11='Western')</b>
Since we wrapped the word <em>Western</em> in single quotes instead of double quotes, we receive how an error:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/filteranother4.jpg"572">
To fix this error, simply use double quotes.

Suppose we have the following two columns in Google Sheets that contain the names of basketball players on two teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/duptwo2.jpg"485">
Now suppose that we would like to highlight the duplicate names across both columns.
To do so, we can highlight the cells in the range<b> A2:B9</b>, then click the <b>Format</b> tab, then click <b>Conditional formatting</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/duptwo3.jpg"567">
In the <b>Conditional format rules</b> panel that appears, click the dropdown menu under <b>Format cells if</b> and choose <b>Custom formula is</b>, then type the following formula:
<b>=COUNTIF($A$2:$B$9,A2)>1</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/duptwo4.jpg"347">
Once you click <b>Done</b>, the duplicate values that occur in both columns will be highlighted in green:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/duptwo1.jpg">
We can see that the following names are duplicates across the two columns:
Andy
Chad
Frank
Each of these names occur in both columns.
Note that by default, Google Sheets uses a light green background for conditional formatting.
However, you can change the background color, font color, and font style of the conditional formatting to format the duplicate values however you’d like.

A <b>histogram</b> is a plot that can be used to quickly visualize the distribution of values in a dataset.
This tutorial provides a step-by-step example of how to create a histogram in Google Sheets and how to modify the <b>number of bins</b> so that the histogram looks exactly how you’d like.
<h2>Step 1: Create the Data</h2>
First, let’s create the following dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/histbins1.jpg"463">
<h2>Step 2: Create the Histogram</h2>
Next, highlight the cells in the range <b>A2:A21</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab, then click <b>Chart</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/histbins2.jpg"519">

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Number of Bins</h2>
To adjust the number of bins in the histogram, click the <b>Customize</b> tab within the <b>Chart editor</b> panel, then click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Histogram</b>.
Click the dropdown arrow under <b>Bucket size</b> to bring up a list of potential bucket sizes you can use:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/histbins5.jpg"323">
If we click <b>2</b>, then this will change the bucket size to <b>2</b> in the histogram:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/histbins6.jpg"543">
The first bucket tells us how many values in the original dataset are greater than or equal to 2 but less than 4.
The second bucket tells us how many values in the original dataset are greater than or equal to 4 but less than 6.
And so on.
If we instead choose a bucket size of <b>10</b>, the buckets will have a width of 10:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/histbins7.jpg"583">
Feel free to modify the number of bins to whatever value you’d like and keep in mind the following rules of thumb:
<b>Increasing the bucket size</b> decreases the number of total bins in the histogram and leads to fatter and fewer bins.
<b>Decreasing the bucket size</b> increases the number of total bins in the histogram and leads to narrower and more bins.

<b>=IF(OR(A2="Mavs", B2="Guard", C2>25), "Yes", "No")</b>
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/if1.jpg"590">
<h2>Example 1: Nested IF Function</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to return a specific value based on the value for each player in the <b>Points</b> column:
<b>=IF(C2&lt;15, "Bad", IF(C2&lt;20, "OK",  IF(C2&lt;25, "Good", "Great")))</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/if2.jpg"614">
Here’s what this formula did:
If the value in the Points column is less than 15, return <b>Bad</b>.
Else, if the value in the Points column is less than 20, return <b>OK</b>.
Else, if the value in the Points column is less than 25, return <b>Good</b>.
Else, return <b>Great</b>.
<h2>Example 2: IF Function with AND Logic</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to return “Yes” if three conditions are met for a specific player or “No” if at least one of the conditions is not met:
<b>=IF(AND(A2="Mavs", B2="Guard", C2>25), "Yes", "No")</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/if3.jpg"603">
Here’s what this formula did:
If the value in the Team column was “Mavs” and the value in the Position column was “Guard” and the value in the Points column was greater than 25, return <b>Yes</b>.
Else, if at least one condition is not met then return <b>No</b>.
Notice that only one row returned “Yes” because only one row met all three conditions.
<h2>Example 3: IF Function with OR Logic</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to return “Yes” if one of three conditions are met for a specific player or “No” if none of the conditions are met:
<b>=IF(OR(A2="Mavs", B2="Guard", C2>25), "Yes", "No")</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/if4.jpg"570">
Here’s what this formula did:
If the value in the Team column was “Mavs” or the value in the Position column was “Guard” or the value in the Points column was greater than 25, return <b>Yes</b>.
Else, if none of the conditions are met then return <b>No</b>.
Notice that six total rows returned “Yes” because each of those rows met at least one of the three conditions.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Convert Negative Numbers to Zero</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to convert negative numbers to zero in Google Sheets:
<b>Formula 1: Convert Existing Negative Numbers to Zero</b>
<b>=IF(A2&lt;0, 0, A2)
</b>
For this particular formula, if the value in cell A2 is negative then it is converted to a zero. Otherwise, it is left alone.
<b>Formula 2: Convert Negative Numbers to Zero in Formula</b>
<b>=MAX(0, B2-C2)</b>
For this particular formula, if the result of the formula B2 – C2 is negative then the formula simply returns a zero. Otherwise, the formula returns the result of the subtraction.
The following examples shows how to use each formula in practice.
<h2>Example 1: Convert Existing Negative Numbers to Zero</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/neg1.jpg"477">
We can use the following formula to convert each negative number in column A to a zero:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;0, 0, A2)</b>
We can type this formula into cell B2 and simply click and drag the formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/neg2.jpg"501">
Notice that all negative numbers have been converted to zero.
<h2>Example 2: Convert Negative Numbers to Zero in Formula</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/neg3.jpg"485">
We can use the following formula to subtract the values in column C from the values in column B and return a zero if the result of the subtraction is negative:
<b>=MAX(0, B2-C2)</b>
We can type this formula into cell D2 and simply click and drag the formula down to each remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/neg4.jpg"580">
Notice that in each case where the formula would have produced a negative number, a zero is returned instead.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: A Simple Formula for “If Not Empty”</span></h2>
You can use the following formula in Google Sheets to perform some task if a cell is not empty:
<b>=IF(A1&lt;>"", Value_If_Not_Empty, Value_If_Empty)
</b>
This particular formula checks if cell <b>A1</b> is empty. If it is not empty, then <b>Value_If_Not_Empty</b> is returned. Otherwise, <b>Value_If_Empty</b> is returned.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Use “If Not Empty” Formula</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/empty1.jpg"476">
We can use the following formula to return a value of “Team Exists” if the cell in column A is not empty. Otherwise, we’ll return a value of “Does Not Exist”:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>"", "Team Exists", "Does Not Exist")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/empty2.jpg">
If the team name is not empty in column A, then “Team Exists” is returned.
Otherwise, “Does Not Exist” is returned.
Note that we could also return numeric values instead of character values.
For example, we could use the following formula to return the value of the points column multiplied by two if the cell in column A is not empty. Otherwise, we’ll return an empty value:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>"", B2*2, "")
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/empty3.jpg"498">
If the team name is not empty in column A, then we return the value in the points column multiplied by two.
Otherwise, we return an empty value.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Formula for “If Time is Greater Than”</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to create an IF statement that compares the time in a cell to some specific time in Google Sheets:
<b>=IF(B2>TIME(0, 5, 0), "Slow", "Fast")
</b>
This particular formula checks the time in cell B2 and returns “Slow” if it is greater than 5 minutes or “Fast” if it is equal to or less than 5 minutes.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>TIME</b> function uses a format of <b>TIME(hours, minutes, seconds)</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Formula for “If Time is Greater Than” in Google Sheets</h2>

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Ignore Blank Cells with Formulas</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas in Google Sheets to ignore blank values when performing calculations:
<b>Formula 1: Calculate Average & Ignore Blanks</b>
<b>=AVERAGEIF(A2:A13,"&lt;>",B2:B13)
</b>
This formula calculates the average value in the range <b>B2:B13</b> only for the cells where <b>A2:A13</b> is not blank.
<b>Formula 2: Calculate Sum & Ignore Blanks</b>
<b>=SUMIF(A2:A13,"&lt;>",B2:B13)
</b>
This formula calculates the sum of values in the range <b>B2:B13</b> only for the cells where <b>A2:A13</b> is not blank.
The following examples show how to use these formulas in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Calculate Average & Ignore Blanks</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the average value in the <b>Points</b> column only for the cells where the value in the <b>Team</b> column is not blank:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank1.jpg"574">
The average points value for the teams that aren’t blank is <b>16.25</b>.
We can verify this is correct by manually calculating the average points value for the non-blank teams:
Average Points for Non-Blank Teams: (14+19+15+5+12+14+32+19) / 8 = <b>16.25</b>.
<h3>Example 2: Calculate Sum & Ignore Blanks</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the sum of values in the <b>Points</b> column only for the cells where the value in the <b>Team</b> column is not blank:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank2.jpg"570">
The sum of the points values for the teams that aren’t blank is <b>130</b>.
We can verify this is correct by manually calculating the sum of the points values for the non-blank teams:
Sum of Points for Non-Blank Teams: 14+19+15+5+12+14+32+19 = <b>130</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Ignore #N/A Values with Formulas in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to calculate different metrics in Google Sheets while ignoring #N/A values:
<b>=AVERAGE(IFNA(A2:A14, "")) 
=SUM(IFNA(A2:A14, ""))
=IFNA(VLOOKUP(E2, A2:A14, 2, FALSE), "")</b>
These formulas simply replace #N/A values with blanks and then calculates the metric you’re interested in.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Calculate Average & Ignore #N/A Values</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the average of a dataset that contains #N/A values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nagoogle1.jpg"532">

    IMPORTRANGE("URL2", "'sheetname2'!A1:B10");
    IMPORTRANGE("URL3", "'sheetname3'!A1:B10");
  })</b>
This particular query returns data from three different spreadsheets at once.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Use IMPORTRANGE with Multiple Sheets</h3>
Suppose we would like to import data from two different Google spreadsheets at once.
The first sheet is located in a tab called <b>stats</b> at the following URL:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q3.png">

Notice that the data from both sheets is returned.
Also notice that the header column from the second sheet is returned in row 13.
To prevent this column from being imported, we can insert a <b>where</b> statement into our <b>IMPORTRANGE</b> function:
<b>=QUERY({IMPORTRANGE("1AdlE9V0aYMdrCmAGtvGXIEfo3szQ1tWRJ2HhJkUhg_4","'stats'!A1:C12");

You can use the following basic syntax to use the <b>IMPORTRANGE</b> function in Google Sheets with specific conditions:
<b>=QUERY(IMPORTRANGE("URL","Sheet1!A1:G9"),"where Col2='Spurs'")
</b>
This returns only the data in the range <b>A1:G9</b> from the tab named <b>Sheet1</b> within the Google Sheets spreadsheet with a specific <b>URL </b>where the second column has a value of <b>Spurs</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Use IMPORTRANGE with Conditions</h3>
Suppose the data we’re interested in is located in a Google Sheets spreadsheet within a tab called <b>stats</b> at the following URL:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q3.png">
We can use the following syntax to return only the rows from this tab where the value in the second column is equal to <b>Spurs</b>:
<b>=QUERY(IMPORTRANGE("1AdlE9V0aYMdrCmAGtvGXIEfo3szQ1tWRJ2HhJkUhg_4",

Notice that only the Player and Points columns are returned where the team name is equal to <b>Spurs</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Use INDEX MATCH with Multiple Criteria</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to perform an <b>INDEX MATCH</b> in Google Sheets with multiple criteria:
<b>=INDEX(reference,MATCH(1,(criteria1)*(criteria2)*(criteria3)*...,0))
</b>
where:
<b>reference</b>: The range from which a value will be returned
<b>MATCH</b>: Gives the position of your search key
<b>1</b>: Specifies a fixed search key
<b>criteria1</b>, <b>criteria2</b>, <b>criteria3</b>: The criteria to match
<b>0</b>: Species to search for an exact value
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: INDEX MATCH with Multiple Criteria in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following data in Google Sheets that shows information for various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/indexmatch1.jpg"552">
Now suppose we would like to find the Points value associated with the player who is on the <b>Mavs</b>, has a Position of <b>Forward</b>, and has an All Star Status of <b>Yes</b>.
We can use the following <b>INDEX MATCH</b> formula to find this Points value:
<b>=INDEX(D:D,MATCH(1,(A:A=A15)*(B:B=B15)*(C:C=C15),0))
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/indexmatch2.jpg">
The formula correctly returns a Points value of <b>11</b> for the player who is on the <b>Mavs</b> team, has a position of <b>Forward</b>, and has an All Star Status of <b>Yes</b>.
Note that if we change the values in row 15, our INDEX MATCH formula will automatically update.
For example, suppose we instead use this formula to find the Points value for the player who is on the <b>Spurs</b> team, has a position of <b>Guard</b>, and has an All Star Status of <b>Yes</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/indexmatch3.jpg"577">
The formula correctly returns a Points value of <b>22</b> for this player.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Use ISBLANK with Cell Range</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to check if cells in a range are blank in Google Sheets:
<b>Method 1: Check if All Cells in Range Are Blank</b>
<b>=AND(ARRAYFORMULA(ISBLANK(A2:C2)))
</b>
If <em>all</em> cells in the range A2:C2 are blank, this formula returns TRUE. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.
<b>Method 2: Check if Any Cells in Range Are Blank</b>
<b>=OR(ARRAYFORMULA(ISBLANK(A2:C2))) 
</b>
If <em>any</em> cells in the range A2:C2 are blank, this formula returns TRUE. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.
The following examples show how to use each method in Google Sheets.
<h3>Example 1: Check if All Cells in Range Are Blank</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/isblank1.jpg"476">
We’ll type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to check if every cell in row 2 is blank:
<b>=AND(ARRAYFORMULA(ISBLANK(A2:C2)))</b>
We’ll then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/isblank2.jpg">
From the output we can see that the only row to return <b>TRUE</b> is row 8, which contains blank values in each column.
<h3>Example 2: Check if Any Cells in Range Are Blank</h3>
Once again suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/isblank1.jpg"476">
We’ll type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to check if any cell in row 2 is blank:
<b>=OR(ARRAYFORMULA(ISBLANK(A2:C2)))</b>
We’ll then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/isblank3.jpg"522">
From the output we can see that three rows return a value of <b>TRUE</b>.
Each of these rows has at least one blank cell.
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>ISBLANK </b>function in Google Sheets  here .
<h2><span class="orange">How to Link to Another Tab in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to link from one tab in a Google Sheets spreadsheet to another tab in the same spreadsheet.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>HYPERLINK()</b> function and the following example shows how to do so.
<h3>Example: Link to Another Tab in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following spreadsheet that has four tabs containing various information about basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/link1.png">
To create a link to the <b>Points</b> tab, first click on the Points tab and then copy the URL at the top of your browser.
You’ll notice that the URL of the <b>Points</b> tab will be different than the <b>Team</b> tab. For example, the URL of the <b>Team</b> tab ends with:
<b>#gid=0
</b>
Conversely, the URL of the <b>Points</b> tab ends with:
<b>#gid=788433911</b>
We can then type in the following formula in cell B2 to create a link to the <b>Points</b> tab:
<b>=HYPERLINK("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jTA/edit#gid=788433911", "Points")</b>
Once we do so, a hyperlink will appear in the spreadsheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/link2.png">
When we click this hyperlink, it will automatically take us to the <b>Points</b> tab:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/link3.png">
Note that we can use this same process to create a link to the <b>Assists</b> and <b>Rebounds</b> tabs as well.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Find Max Value by Group</span></h2>
Often you may want to find the max value of some dataset in Google Sheets based on a category or group.
For example, suppose we have the following dataset and we’d like to find the max value of “points” for each team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/maxgroup1.jpg"507">
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, enter the data values into Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/maxgroup1.jpg"507">
<h2>Step 2: Find the Unique Groups</h2>
Next, we need to use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> function to produce a list of unique team names.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>D2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(A2:A16)
</b>
This will produce a list of unique teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/maxgroup2.jpg"512">
<h2>Step 3: Find the Max Value by Group</h2>
Next, we will use the following formula to find the max points scored by each team:
<b>=ArrayFormula(MAX(IF(A:A=D2,B:B)))
</b>
We will type this formula into cell <b>E2</b> and then drag it down to the remaining cells in column E:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/maxgroup3.jpg">
From the results we can see:
The max points scored by players on the Mavs is <b>26</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Warriors is <b>19</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Lakers is <b>33</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Heat is <b>19</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Celtics is <b>29</b>.
<b>Note</b>: To calculate the minimum points scored by each team, simply replace the <b>MAX</b> in the formula with <b>MIN</b>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/monthsbetween2.jpg">
Here’s how to interpret the output:
There are approximately <b>1.099</b> months between 1/1/2022 and 2/4/2022.
There are approximately <b>4.723</b> months between 1/7/2022 and 5/29/2022.
There are approximately <b>0.526</b> months between 1/20/2022 and 2/5/2022.
And so on.
<b>Note #1</b>: This formula uses <b>365/12</b> to approximate the number of days in a month. You can replace this value with <b>30</b> if you’d like to simplify the formula and make the assumption that a typical month has 30 days.
<b>Note #2</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>DATEDIF</b> function in Google Sheets  here .
<h2><span class="orange">How to Add Multiple Trendlines to Chart in Google Sheets</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to create a chart in Google Sheets with multiple trendlines.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter some values that show the total sales of two different products during various years:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend1.jpg"479">
<h3>Step 2: Create the Chart</h3>
To create a chart to visualize the sales of each product by year, highlight the values in the range A1:C11. Then click the <b>Insert</b> tab and then click <b>Chart</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend2.jpg"482">
By default, Google Sheets will insert a line chart:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend3.jpg"547">
To turn this into a scatterplot, click the <b>Setup</b> tab within the <b>Chart editor</b> panel and choose <b>Scatter chart</b> as Chart type:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend4.jpg"321">
The chart will automatically be turned into a scatterplot:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend5.jpg"557">
The blue dots show the sales of product A each year and the red dots show the sales of product B each year.
<h3>Step 3: Add Multiple Trendlines</h3>
In the <b>Chart editor</b> panel that appears on the right side of the screen, use the following steps to add a trendline to the blue dots:
Click the <b>Customize</b> tab.
Then click the<b> Series</b> dropdown.
Then choose <b>Product A Sales</b> from the dropdown list.
Then check the box next to <b>Trendline</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend6.jpg"316">
Repeat this process, except choose <b>Product B Sales</b> from the dropdown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend7.jpg"315">
The trendlines for Product A Sales and Product B Sales will both be added to the chart:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multipletrend8.jpg">
Note that within the <b>Customize</b> tab you can also modify the color, line thickness and opacity of each trendline.
Also note that Google Sheets uses a linear trendline by default, but within the <b>Customize</b> tab you can also choose to use exponential, polynomial, or other trendlines.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Multiply Column by a Constant</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to multiply a column by a constant in Google Sheets:
<b>=CELL*CONSTANT
</b>
For example, you can use the following formula to multiply the value in cell A1 by 5:
<b>=A1*5 
</b>
You can then click and drag this formula down to multiply every value in column A by 5.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Multiply Column by a Constant in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following list of values in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/multpercent1.jpg"523">
We can use the following formula to multiply the value in cell A2 by 5:
<b>=A2*5</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/multconstant1.jpg"505">
Next, we can hover over the bottom right-hand corner of cell B2 until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears. Then click and drag down to all of the remaining cells in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/multconstant2.jpg"501">
All of the values in column B are equal to 5 times the values in column A.
For example:
10 * 5 = <b>50</b>.
15 * 5 = <b>75</b>.
18 * 5 = <b>90</b>.
20 * 5 = <b>100</b>.
25 * 5 = <b>125</b>.
And so on.
To multiply by a different constant, simply change the value used in cell B2.
For example, to multiply by 9 simply use the following formula:
<b>=A2*9</b>
Then click and drag this formula down to all of the remaining cells in column B.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Multiply Column by a Percentage</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to multiply a column by a percentage in Google Sheets:
<b>=CELL*(PERCENT/100)
</b>
For example, you can use the following formula to multiply the value in cell A1 by 50%:
<b>=A1*(50/100) 
</b>
You can then click and drag this formula down to multiply every value in column A by 50%.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Multiply Column by a Percentage in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following list of values in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/multpercent1.jpg"523">
We can use the following formula to multiply the value in cell A2 by 50%:
<b>=A2*(50/100) </b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/multpercent2.jpg"510">
Next, we can hover over the bottom right-hand corner of cell B2 until a tiny “<b>+</b>” appears. Then click and drag down to all of the remaining cells in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/multpercent3.jpg"496">
All of the values in column B are equal to 50% of the values in column A.
For example:
50% of 10 is <b>5</b>.
50% of 15 is <b>7.5</b>
50% of 18 is <b>9</b>.
50% of 20 is <b>10</b>.
And so on.
To multiply by a different percentage, simply change the value used in cell B2.
For example, to multiply by 90% simply use the following formula:
<b>=A2*(90/100) </b>
Then click and drag this formula down to all of the remaining cells in column B.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Create Pivot Table with Unique Counts</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to create a pivot table in Google Sheets that displays the count of unique values of some variable.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following data that shows the total revenue generated by certain products in certain regions for some company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pivot11.png">
<h2>Step 2: Create the Pivot Table</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/piv1.jpg"348">
To instead display the unique count of products by region, click the dropdown arrow under <b>Summarize by</b> and click <b>COUNTUNIQUE</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/piv2.jpg">
The pivot table will update to show the unique count of products by region:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/piv3.jpg"357">
 For example, we can see:
There were 3 unique products in the East region.
There were 3 unique products in the North region.
There were 3 unique products in the South region.
There were 3 unique products in the West region.
And so on.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Create Pivot Table from Multiple Sheets</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to create a pivot table from multiple sheets in Google Sheets.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
Suppose we have a spreadsheet with two sheets titled <b>week1</b> and <b>week2</b>:
<b>Week1:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multiplepivot1.jpg"543">
<b>Week2:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multiplepivot2.jpg"545">
Suppose we would like to create a pivot table using data from both sheets.
<h3>Step 2: Consolidate Data into One Sheet</h3>
Before we can create a pivot table using both sheets, we must consolidate all of the data into one sheet.
We can use the following <b>QUERY</b> formula to do so:
<b>=QUERY({week1!A1:C11;week2!A2:C11})
</b>
Here’s how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multiplepivot3.jpg"478">
Notice that the data from the <b>week1</b> and <b>week2</b> sheets are now consolidated into one sheet.
<h3>Step 3: Create the Pivot Table</h3>
To create the pivot table, we’ll highlight the values in the range <b>A1:C21</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab and then click <b>Pivot table</b>.
We can then create the following pivot table:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multiplepivot4.jpg"678">
The final pivot table includes data from both the <b>week1</b> and <b>week2</b> sheets.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Display Percentage of Total in Pivot Table</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to display the percentage of a total in a pivot table in Google Sheets.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the following data that shows the number of sales made during various days by some company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/percentTotal1.jpg"460">
<h3>Step 2: Create the Pivot Table</h3>

Here’s how to interpret the values in the pivot table:
Column D shows the date.
Column E shows the sum of sales for each date.
Column F shows the percentage of total sales for each date.
In column F we can see:
<b>24.18%</b> of all sales were made on 1/1/2021.
<b>27.47%</b> of all sales were made on 1/2/2021.
<b>48.35%</b> of all sales were made on 1/3/2021.
Notice that the percentages sum to 100%.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Plot Multiple Lines in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>

The following line chart will automatically appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/linesgoogle4.jpg">
The x-axis displays the years, the y-axis displays the total sales, and the three individual lines represent the sales for each of the three products.
Feel free to click on specific elements in the plot to change the colors of the lines, the legend location, the title, and the axis labels.
<h3>Example 2: Plot Multiple Lines with Data Arranged by Rows</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that displays the total sales for three different products during different years, arranged by rows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/linesgoogle5.jpg"674">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Create Progress Bars in Google Sheets (Step-by-Step)</span></h2>
This step-by-step tutorial explains how to create the following progress bars in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/prog4.jpg">
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter some data that shows the progress percentage for 10 different tasks:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/prog1.jpg"477">
<h3>Step 2: Add the Progress Bars</h3>
Next, type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b> to create a progress bar for the first task:
<b>=SPARKLINE(B2,{"charttype","bar";"max",1;"min",0;"color1","green"})
</b>
Copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/prog2.jpg"654">
The length of each progress bar in column C reflects the percentage value in column B.
<h3>Step 3: Format the Progress Bars (Optional)</h3>
You can modify the progress bars to display specific colors based on the progress percentage.
For example, you can use the following formula to display a <b>green</b> progress bar if the percentage is greater than 70, else a <b>yellow</b> progress bar if the percentage is greater than 50, else a <b>red</b> progress bar:
<b>=SPARKLINE(B2,{"charttype","bar";"max",1;"min",0;"color1",IF(B2>0.7,"green",IF(B2>0.5,"yellow","red"))})
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/prog3.jpg"501">
The color of the progress bar is now dependent on the value in column B.
Feel free to add a border around the cells and increase the length and width of the cells to make the progress bars larger and easier to read:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Query From Another Sheet</span></h2>
To query from another tab within the same spreadsheet in Google Sheets, you can use the following syntax:
<b>=query(stats!A1:C9, “select A, B“, 1)</b>
This returns columns <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> from the cell range <b>A1:C9</b> within the tab named <b>stats</b>. The <b>1</b> specifies that there is 1 header row at the top of the dataset being queried.
To query from another spreadsheet entirely, you can use the following syntax:
<b>=query(importrange(“URL“,  “stats!A1:C9“), “select Col1, Col2“, 1) </b>
This returns the first two columns from the cell range <b>A1:C9</b> within the tab named <b>stats</b> within the Google Sheets spreadsheet with a specific <b>URL</b>.
The following examples show how to use these functions in practice.
<h3>Example: Query from Tab in Same Spreadsheet</h3>
Suppose we have the following Google Sheets spreadsheet with two tabs: 
<b>stats</b>
<b>new_sheet</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q1.png">
To perform a query on the data in the <b>stats</b> tab and return the results of the query in the <b>new_sheet</b> tab, we can type the following formula in cell A1 of the <b>new_sheet</b> tab:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q2.png">
<h3>Example: Query from Another Spreadsheet</h3>
Now suppose that we would like to query from another spreadsheet entirely. To do so, we simply need to identify the URL of the Google Sheets spreadsheet that we’d like to query from.
For example, suppose the data we’re interested in is located at the following URL:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q3.png">
We can use the <b>importrange()</b> function to query data from this spreadsheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q4.png">
Notice the subtle difference between this example and the previous example:
When querying from a tab within the same spreadsheet, we use <b>select A, B</b>
When querying from an entirely different spreadsheet, we use <b>select Col1, Col2</b>
You can find more Google Sheets tutorials on  this page .
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use Cell Reference in Formula</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to use a cell reference in a Google Sheets query:
<b>=QUERY($A$1:$B$11, "Select B where A contains '"&D3&"'")
</b>
In this particular query, we tell Google Sheets to select the value in column B where column A contains whatever value is in cell <b>D3</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Use Cell Reference in Google Sheets Query</h3>
Suppose we have the following two datasets in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cell1.png">
Now suppose we’d like to add a ‘points’ column to the right of the ‘assists’ column, which contains the points scored by each team in column D.
We can use the following syntax to do so:
<b>=QUERY($A$1:$B$11, "Select B where A contains '"&D3&"'")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in cell F2 of our spreadsheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cell2.png">
In this example, we told Google Sheets to select the value in column <b>B</b> where column <b>A</b> contained the team name in cell <b>D2</b>.
In this case, it saw that <b>D2</b> contained ‘Hornets’ so it returned the ‘points’ value for Hornets, which turned out to be 78.
We can then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column F:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cell3.png">
<h2><span class="orange">How to Use Column Names in Google Sheets Query</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to use a column name in a Google Sheets query:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11,"SELECT "&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,MATCH("Team",A1:C1,0),4),1,""))</b>
This particular query will select the column with the name “Team” in the cell range <b>A1:C11</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use Column Name in Google Sheets Query</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname1.jpg"476">
If we would like to select the “Team” column in an ordinary query, we would reference the column as <b>A</b> since it’s the first column in the range we’re interested in:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT A")</b>
This would return just column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname2.jpg"596">
However, if we attempt to use “Team” as the column name then we’ll receive an error:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT Team")</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname3.jpg"585">
Instead, we must use the following formula to select the “Team” column by name:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11,"SELECT "&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,MATCH("Team",A1:C1,0),4),1,""))</b>
This will return the “Team” column from the original dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname4.jpg">
Note that you can use multiple <b>SUBSTITUTE</b> functions if you’d like to select multiple columns by name.
For example, you can use the following syntax to select both the “Team” and “Position” columns by name:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11,"SELECT "&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,MATCH("Team",A1:C1,0),4),1,"")&","&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,MATCH("Position",A1:C1,0),4),1,""))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname5.jpg"689">
Notice that the query returns both the “Team” and the “Position” columns.

This particular formula concatenates the results of the query using <b>_</b> as the separator but you can change this separator to be anything you’d like.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Use CONCAT with QUERY in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/concatquery1.jpg"478">
We can use the following formula to query for rows where the first name contains “Andy” and concatenate the first, middle, and last names into one cell per row:
<b>=ARRAYFORMULA(
SUBSTITUTE(
trim(transpose(query(transpose(query(A:C, "select * where A contains 'Andy'")),,COLUMNS(query(A:C, "select * where A contains 'Andy'")))))," ","_")
)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/concatquery2-1.jpg"657">
Notice that the query only returns the rows where the first name contains ‘Andy’ and the first, middle, and last name are all concatenated into one cell per row using an underscore <b>_</b> as the separator.
To use a different separator, simply change the “<b>_</b>” at the end of the formula with something else.
For example, the following screenshot shows how to use a space as a separator instead:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/concatquery3.jpg"668">
Once again the query only returns the rows where the first name contains ‘Andy’ and the first, middle, and last name are all concatenated into one cell per row using a space as the separator.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: Select Rows that Contain String</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to select rows that contain a specific string using the Google Sheets query function:
<b>=query(A1:C9, “select A, B where B contains ‘this’“, 1)</b>
This particular query selects columns A and B from the cell range <b>A1:C9</b> where column B contains the string ‘this’ and the <b>1</b> specifies that there is 1 header row at the top of the cell range.
The following examples show how to use this function in practice with the following dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mult1.png">
<h3>Example 1: Select Rows that Contain a String</h3>
We can use the following syntax to select all rows where the Team column contains the string ‘<b>Lak</b>‘:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/contain1.png">
This query returns the two rows that contain the string ‘Lak’ in the Team column.
<h3>Example 2: Select Rows that Do Not Contain a String</h3>
We can use the following syntax to select all rows where the Team column <em>does not</em> contain the string ‘<b>Lak</b>‘:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/contain2.png">
Notice that this returns every row where the team name is not equal to Lakers.
<h3>Example 3: Select Rows that Contain One of Several Strings</h3>
We can use the following syntax to select all rows where the Team column contains the string ‘<b>Lak</b>‘ or the string ‘<b>Mav</b>‘:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/contain3.png">
This returns only the rows where the team name is equal to Lakers or Mavericks.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use the COUNT Function</span></h2>
You can use the <b>COUNT() </b>function in a Google Sheets query to count the number of rows that meet certain conditions.
<b>Method 1: Count Total Rows</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select count(A)")</b>
<b>Method 2: Count Total Rows that Meet One Criteria</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select count(A) where B>100")
</b>
<b>Method 3: Count Total Rows that Meet Multiple Criteria</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select count(A) where A='Mavs' OR B>100")
=QUERY(A1:C13, "select count(A) where A='Mavs' AND B>100")
</b>
The following examples show how to use each of these methods in practice.
<h3>Method 1: Count Total Rows</h3>
We can use the following formula to count the total number of teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/count1.png">
We can see that there are <b>12</b> total teams.
<h3>Example 2: Count Total Rows that Meet One Criteria</h3>
We can use the following formula to count the total number of teams where the points is greater than 100:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/count2.png">
We can see that there are <b>2</b> teams that have over 100 points.
We can use the following formula to count the total number of teams that have<em> less than</em> 100 points:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/count3.png">
We can see that <b>10</b> teams have less than 100 points.
<h3>
<b>Example 3: Count Total Rows that Meet Multiple Criteria</b>
</h3>
We can use the following formula to count the total number of teams where the team name is “Mavs” or where the points is greater than 100:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/count4.png">
We can see that <b>3</b> teams meet either of these criteria.
We can use the following formula to count the total number of teams where the points is greater than 90 <em>and</em> the rebounds is greater than 30:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/count5.png">
We can see that <b>2</b> teams meet both of these criteria.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Filter by Date Range</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to filter by a date range in a Google Sheets query:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C9,"select * where A > date '"&TEXT(DATEVALUE("1/1/2020"),"yyyy-mm-dd")&"'")
</b>
This particular formula returns all rows in the range <b>A1:C9</b> where the date is after <b>1/1/2020</b>.
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice with the following dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/queryDate1.png">
<h3>Example 1: Filter Rows Before Some Date</h3>
We can use the following formula to filter for rows where the date is before 1/10/2020:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C17,"select * where A &lt; date '"&TEXT(DATEVALUE("1/10/2020"),"yyyy-mm-dd")&"'")</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/queryDate2.png">
Notice that only the rows where the date is before 1/10/2020 are returned.
<h3>Example 2: Filter Rows After Some Date</h3>
We can use the following formula to filter for rows where the date is after 1/10/2020:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C17,"select * where A > date '"&TEXT(DATEVALUE("1/10/2020"),"yyyy-mm-dd")&"'")</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/queryDate3.png">
Notice that only the rows where the date is after 1/10/2020 are returned.
<h3>Example 3: Filter Rows Between Two Dates</h3>
We can use the following formula to filter for rows where the date is between 1/5/2020 and 1/15/2020:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C17,"select * where A > date '"&TEXT(DATEVALUE("1/5/2020"),"yyyy-mm-dd")&"'and A &lt; date '"&TEXT(DATEVALUE("1/15/2020"),"yyyy-mm-dd")&"'")</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/queryDate4.png">
Notice that only the rows where the date is between 1/5/2020 and 1/15/2020 are returned.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use Group By</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to group and aggregate data in a Google Sheets Query:
<b>=query(A1:D12, "select B, avg(D) group by B", 1)
</b>
In this example, we select columns <b>B</b> and <b>D</b> in cell range <b>A1:D12</b>. We then find the average of column <b>D</b>, grouped by column <b>B</b>. We also specify a <b>1</b> to indicate that there is 1 header row at the top of the dataset.
In this example, we used the <b>avg()</b> aggregate function, but we can use any of the following aggregate functions:
<b>avg()</b>
<b>sum()</b>
<b>count()</b>
<b>min()</b>
<b>max()</b>
The following examples show how to group and aggregate data in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Group & Aggregate by One Column</h3>
We can use the following formula to select the Team and Points columns, then find the average of the Points column, grouped by Team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/agg1.png">
This tells us that:
The average points scored by players on the Cavs is <b>10.8</b>.
The average points scored by players on the Celtics is <b>12.7</b>.
And so on.
<h3>Example 2: Group & Aggregate by Multiple Columns</h3>
We can use the following formula to select the Team, Conference and Points columns, then find the maximum of the Points column, grouped by Team and Conference:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/agg2.png">
This tells us that:
The max points scored by any player on the Cavs team in the East Conference is <b>13.4</b>.
The max points scored by any player on the Celtics team in the East Conference is <b>22.4</b>.
And so on.
<h3>How to Avoid #VALUE! Errors</h3>
To avoid #VALUE! errors when grouping and aggregating data, make sure that every column included in the <b>select</b> statement meets one of the following criteria:
Has an aggregate function applied to it.
Is included in the <b>group by</b> statement.
As long as each column in the <b>select</b> statement meets one of these criteria, then you can avoid a #VALUE! error.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Ignore Blank Cells in Query</span></h2>
You can use the following methods to ignore blank cells in specific columns when performing a Google Sheets query:
<b>Method 1: Ignore Blank Cells in One Column</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "select * where B is not null")
</b>
<b>Method 2: Ignore Blank Cells in Multiple Columns</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "select * where B is not null and C is not null")</b>
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:

<h2>Example 1: Query Rows & Ignore Blanks in One Column</h2>
We can use the following formula to select all rows where the <b>Points </b>column is not blank:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "select * where B is not null")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ignoreblank12.jpg">
Notice that only the rows where the <b>Points</b> column is not blank are returned.
<h2>Example 2: Query Rows & Ignore Blanks in Multiple Columns</h2>
We can use the following formula to select all rows where the <b>Points </b>column <em>and</em> the <b>Assists</b> column is not blank:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Insert Blank Columns in Output</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax in a Google Sheets query to insert a blank column in the output of the query:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C12, "SELECT A, ' ', B LABEL ' ' ''")
</b>
This particular query will select column A from the range <b>A1:C12</b>, then insert a blank column, then select column B from the range <b>A1:C12</b>.
<b>Note</b>: The<b> LABEL</b> clause tells the query to use an empty header for the new blank column.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Insert Blank Column in Google Sheets Query</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/blank1.jpg"501">
We can use the following formula to select column A from the range <b>A1:C12</b>, then insert an empty column, then select column B from the range <b>A1:C12</b>.
<b>=QUERY(A1:C12, "SELECT A, ' ', B LABEL ' ' ''")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/blank2.jpg">
The query returns the values from column A in the original dataset, then an empty column, then the values from column B.
If you’d like to insert multiple blank columns, you can use the following syntax:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C12, "SELECT A, ' ', '  ', B LABEL ' ' '', '  ' ''")
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/blank3.jpg"604">
Notice that this query inserts two blank columns.
Also note that we had to use the <b>LABEL</b> clause to specify two empty labels for the two new blank columns.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Join Two Tables</span></h2>
Often you may want to use the <b>QUERY()</b> function in Google Sheets to join two tables together.
Unfortunately, a <b>JOIN()</b> function does not exist within the <b>QUERY()</b> function, but you can use the following formula as a workaround to join two tables together:
<b>=ArrayFormula(
   {
     A2:B6,
     vlookup(A2:A6,D2:E6,COLUMN(Indirect("R1C2:R1C"&COLUMNS(D2:E6),0)),0)
   }
)
</b>
This particular formula performs a left join on the tables located in the ranges <b>A2:B6</b> and <b>D2:E6</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Join Two Tables in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following two tables in Google Sheets that contain information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sheetsjoin1.jpg"546">
We can use the following formula to perform a left join on the two tables and return one table that contains the team name, points, and assists for every team in the left table:
<b>=ArrayFormula(
   {
     A2:B6,
     vlookup(A2:A6,D2:E6,COLUMN(Indirect("R1C2:R1C"&COLUMNS(D2:E6),0)),0)

)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sheetsjoin2.jpg">
Notice that the result is one table that contains the team name, points, and assists for every team in the left table.
<b>Note</b>: If a team in the left table does not exist in the right table, a value of <b>#N/A</b> will be returned in the Assists column of the resulting table.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use the Label Clause</span></h2>
You can use the <b>label</b> clause in a Google Sheets query to create specific labels for the results of certain columns.
You can use the following syntax to create a specific label for one column within a query:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select * label A 'Column A'")
</b>
In this example, we select all columns in the range A1:C13 and we label column A as ‘Column A’ in the resulting output.
You can also use the following syntax to create specific labels for multiple columns within a query:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select * label A 'A Column', B 'B Column'") 
</b>
The following examples show how to use these formulas in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Use Label Clause with One Column</h3>
We can use the following formula to select the Team, Points, and Rebounds columns, then label the ‘Team’ column as ‘Team Name’ in the output:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/label11.png">
Notice that the ‘Team’ column has been renamed, but the ‘Points’ and ‘Rebounds’ columns retained their original names.
<h3>Example 2: Use Label Clause with Multiple Columns</h3>
We can use the following formula to select the Team, Points, and Rebounds columns, then label the ‘Team’ column as ‘Team Name’ and ‘Points’ column as ‘Points Scored’ in the output:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/label12.png">
In this example, we used the <b>label</b> clause to rename two columns in the output but we can use this exact same syntax to rename any number of columns that we’d like.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use LIMIT to Limit Rows</span></h2>
You can use the <b>LIMIT</b> clause to limit the number of rows returned by a Google Sheets query.
The <b>LIMIT</b> clause is particularly useful when you want to get a glimpse at a few rows that meet some criteria without displaying every row in the entire dataset that meets some criteria.
This clause uses the following basic syntax:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * LIMIT 5")
</b>
This particular query will return the header row from the range <b>A1:C11</b> along with the first <b>5</b> rows.
The following example shows how to use the <b>LIMIT</b> clause in practice
<h2>Example: Using LIMIT in Google Sheets Query</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname1.jpg"476">
We can use the following query to return the header row along with the first five rows in the dataset:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * LIMIT 5")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/query1.jpg"535">
Notice that the header row along with the first five rows are returned.
It’s worth noting that if the query would naturally return less than 5 rows, then the <b>LIMIT</b> clause won’t force the output to display five rows.
For example, suppose we use the following query to display all players who have more than 25 points:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * WHERE C > 25 LIMIT 5")
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/query2.jpg"569">
Notice that only two rows are returned because there are only two players in the original dataset that have more than 25 points.
Notice that the <b>LIMIT 5</b> clause didn’t force the output to have 5 rows.
Rather, the <b>LIMIT</b> clause simply sets a maximum value on the number of rows that will be returned.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Query Using Month</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to query for rows in Google Sheets that contain a specific month in a date column:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select A,B,C where month(A)+1=2", 1) 
</b>
This particular query returns the values in columns <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> in the range<b> A1:C13</b> where the date in column A is equal to <b>2</b>.
Note that <b>2</b> represents the month number, i.e. February. 
To query for rows where the date contains January, use <b>1</b>. For December, use <b>12</b>. And so on.
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Query Where Date Contains Specific Month</h3>
We can use the following query to return all rows where the month in column <b>A</b> contains February:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select A,B,C where month(A)+1=2", 1) </b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/monthquery1-1.jpg">
Notice that the four rows returned by the query all contain February in column <b>A</b>.
<h3>Example 2: Query Where Date Contains One of Several Specific Months</h3>
We can use the following query to return all rows where the month in column <b>A</b> contains February <em>or</em> April:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C13, "select A,B,C where month(A)+1=2 or month(A)+1=4", 1) </b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/monthquery2.jpg"671">
Notice that all of the rows returned by the query contain either February or April in column <b>A</b>.
<b>Note</b>: If you receive any errors when using this formula, make sure that the values in column A are formatted as <b>Dates</b>.
To convert the values in column A to a Date format, simply highlight column A and then click <b>Format</b> along the top ribbon, then click <b>Number</b>, then click <b>Date</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use Multiple Criteria in Query</span></h2>
You can use the <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> operators to perform a Google Sheets query with multiple criteria.
<b>Example of AND Operator:</b>
<b>=QUERY(A2:C10, "select A, B, C where A contains 'Hello' and C > 10")
</b>
<b>Example of OR Operator:</b>
<b>=QUERY(A2:C10, "select A, B, C where A contains 'Hey' or C = 10")</b>
The following examples show how to use each operator in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Google Sheets Query Using AND Operator</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/multipleCrit1.png">
We can use the following query to retrieve the teams that are in the East conference <b>and</b> scored more than 90 points:
<b>=QUERY(A2:D11, "select A, B, C, D where B contains 'East' and C > 90")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/multipleCrit2.png">
Notice that the Magic and the Heat are selected because they’re the only two teams that <b>meet both criteria</b> specified in our query.
<h3>Example 2: Google Sheets Query Using OR Operator</h3>
Once again suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/multipleCrit1.png">
We can use the following query to retrieve the teams that are in the East conference <b>or </b>scored more than 90 points:
<b>=QUERY(A2:D11, "select A, B, C, D where B contains 'East' or C > 90")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/multipleCrit3.png">
Every team that is selected <b>met at least one of the criteria</b> specified in our query.
That is, each team selected was either in the ‘East’ conference <em>or</em> they scored more than 90 points.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Query From Multiple Ranges</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to query from multiple ranges in Google Sheets:
<b>=QUERY({Sheet1!A1:B10; Sheet2!A2:B5})
</b>
This particular example will return the cells in the range <b>A1:B10</b> from <b>Sheet1</b> stacked on top of the cells in the range<b> A2:B5</b> from <b>Sheet2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Query From Multiple Ranges in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following data in <b>Sheet1</b> and <b>Sheet2</b> in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball teams:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/q2.jpg"472">
We can use the following formula to query data from both sheets and place the results in a new sheet called <b>Sheet3</b>:
<b>=QUERY({Sheet1!A1:B10; Sheet2!A2:B5})</b>
Here’s how to use the formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/q3.jpg">
Notice that the rows from <b>Sheet1 </b>are simply stacked on top of the rows from <b>Sheet2</b>.
If you would instead like the rows from <b>Sheet2</b> to be placed next to the rows from <b>Sheet1</b>, you can use a comma in the formula instead of a semi-colon:
<b>=QUERY({Sheet1!A1:B10, Sheet2!A1:B10})</b>
Here’s how to use the formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/q4.jpg"541">
Notice that the rows from <b>Sheet2</b> are now placed next to the rows from <b>Sheet1</b>.
<b>Note</b>: In this example we only used two cell ranges, but you can use similar syntax to query from as many cell ranges as you’d like.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/multi3.png">
Notice that all of the data from <b>Week2</b> is simply stacked underneath the data from <b>Week1</b>.
<h3>Example 2: Query & Select Columns From Multiple Sheets</h3>
We can use the following formula to query data from both sheets and place the results in a new sheet called <b>All_Data</b> and also select only specific columns to appear in the new sheet:
<b>=QUERY({Week1!A1:C9;Week2!A1:C9}, "select Col1, Col2")</b>
Here’s how to use the formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/multi4.png">
Notice that only the first two columns (“Team” and “Points”) are shown in the final sheet since we specifically chose Col1 and Col2 in our select statement.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use “Not Equal” in Query</span></h2>
You can use the following methods to use a “not equal” operator in a Google Sheets query:
<b>Method 1: Not Equal to One Specific Value</b>
<b>=query(A1:C11, "select * where A != 'Value1'")
</b>
<b>Method 2: Not Equal to One of Several Values</b>
<b>=query(A1:C11, "select * where A != 'Value1' and B != 'Value2'")</b>
Note that <b>!=</b> is the “not equal” operator in Google Sheets.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/notequal1.jpg"460">
<h3>Example 1: Query Rows Not Equal to One Specific Value</h3>
We can use the following formula to select all rows where the <b>Position</b> column is not equal to ‘Guard’:
<b>=query(A1:C11, "select * where A != 'Guard'")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/notequal2.jpg">
Notice that only the rows where the Position is not equal to ‘Guard’ are returned.
<h3>Example 2: Query Rows Not Equal to One of Several Values</h3>
We can use the following formula to select all rows where the <b>Position</b> column is not equal to ‘Guard’ and the <b>Team</b> column is not equal to ‘Warriors’:
<b>=query(A1:C11, "select * where A != 'Guard' and B != 'Warriors'")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/notequal3.jpg"676">
Notice that only the rows where the <b>Position</b> is not equal to ‘Guard’ and the <b>Team</b> is not equal to ‘Warriors’ are returned.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>query()</b> function is case-sensitive. This means that if you type <b>A != ‘guard’</b> then the query will still return rows where the Position is Guard because the two values don’t have the same case.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Use “NOT LIKE” in Query</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax in a Google Sheets query to return all rows where the value in some column is “NOT LIKE” some pattern:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * WHERE NOT B LIKE '%uar%'")
</b>
This particular query will return all rows in the range <b>A1:C11</b> where column B does not contain the pattern “uar” anywhere in the string.
<b>Note</b>: The<b> %</b> operator is a wildcard character in Google Sheets.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use “NOT LIKE” in Google Sheets Query</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/colname1.jpg"476">
We can use the following query to return all rows where the value in the Position column does not contain the pattern “uar” anywhere in the string.
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * WHERE NOT B LIKE '%uar%'")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/notlike1.jpg">
Notice that the only rows returned are the ones where the Position column does not contain the pattern “uar” anywhere in the string.
In other words, any row with a Position of “Guard” is not returned in the query.
You can also use multiple “NOT LIKE” statements in one query.
For example, we can use the following query to return rows where the Position column does not have  a pattern like “uar” and the Team column does not have a pattern like “er”:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * WHERE NOT B LIKE '%uar%' AND NOT A LIKE '%er%'")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this query in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/notlike2.jpg"659">
Notice that only two rows meet both of these “NOT LIKE” conditions.

You can use the following syntax to order the results of a Google Sheets Query by a certain column:
<b>=query(A1:C12, "select A, B order by B asc", 1)
</b>
In this example, we select columns <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and order the results by column B ascending. We also specify a <b>1</b> to indicate that there is 1 header row at the top of the dataset.
You can also use the following syntax to order by multiple columns:
<b>=query(A1:C12, "select A, B order by B asc, A desc", 1)
</b>
In this example, we select columns <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and order the results by column B ascending, then by column A descending.
The following examples show how to use these formulas in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Order By One Column Ascending</h3>
We can use the following formula to select the Player and Team columns, then order the results by Team in ascending order:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/oq1.png">

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Create a Pivot Table</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to create a pivot table using Google Sheets Query:
<b>=query(A1:C13, "select A, sum(C) group by A pivot B")
</b>
In this example, we choose column <b>A</b> to represent the rows of the pivot table, column <b>B</b> to represent the columns of the pivot table, and the values in column <b>C</b> to be displayed inside the pivot table.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Create a Pivot Table Using SUM()</h3>
We can use the following formula to create a pivot table that displays the total sales by product and by region for a certain company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piv1-1.png">
We would interpret the values in the pivot table as follows:
The total sales of product A in the East region was <b>388</b>.
The total sales of product B in the East region was <b>0</b>.
The total sales of product C in the East region was <b>476</b>.
The total sales of product D in the East region was <b>0</b>.
And so on.
<h3>Example 2: Create a Pivot Table Using AVG()</h3>
We can use the following formula to create a pivot table that displays the average sales by product and by region for a certain company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piv2.png">

And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Remove Header from Results</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to remove the header labels from the results of a Google Sheets query:
<b>Method 1: Remove Header from One Column</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C7,"select A, sum(B) group by A label sum(B) ''")
</b>
This particular example removes the header from the second column of the query results.
<b>Method 2: Remove Header from Multiple Columns</b>
<b>=QUERY(A1:C7,"select A, sum(B), sum(C) group by A label sum(B) '', sum(C) ''")
</b>
This particular example removes the header from the second and third column of the query results.
<b>Method 3: Remove Header from All Columns</b>
<b>=QUERY(QUERY(A1:C7, "select A, sum(B) group by A", 1), "select * offset 1", 0)
</b>
This particular example removes the header from all columns of the query results.
The following examples show how to use each formula with the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/remove1.jpg"495">
<h2>Example 1: Remove Header from One Column</h2>
We can use the following query to return the sum of points scored by each team and remove the header label from the sum of points column:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/remove2.jpg">
Notice that there is no header label for the sum column.
We effectively replaced the label that would have been <b>sum Point</b>s with a blank label instead.
<h2>Example 2: Remove Header from Multiple Columns</h2>
We can use the following query to return the sum of points and sum of assists by each team and remove the header label from each of the summed columns.
<b>=QUERY(A1:C7,"select A, sum(B), sum(C) group by A label sum(B) '', sum(C) ''")</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/remove3.jpg"677">
Notice that there is no header label for the sum of points or sum of assists columns.

<b>=QUERY(A1:C9,"select A, B, C where B &lt; date '"&TEXT(TODAY(),"yyyy-mm-dd")&"'", 1)</b>
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Use TODAY() Function to Retrieve Rows Before Current Date</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the total sales made by two stores on various dates:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/today1.jpg"495">
Let’s assume the current date is <b>1/18/2022</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets Query: How to Return Only Unique Rows</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to return only unique rows when performing a query in Google Sheets:
<b>=UNIQUE(QUERY(A1:B16, "SELECT A, B"))</b>
By wrapping the <b>UNIQUE()</b> function around the <b>QUERY()</b> function, we can return only the unique rows from the query.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Return Unique Rows in Google Sheets Query</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information for 15 basketball players:

The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/uniqueSheets2.jpg"557">
Notice that the query only returns unique combinations of <b>Team</b> and <b>Position</b>.
For example, there are three rows where <b>Team</b> is equal to “A” and <b>Position</b> is equal to “Guard” but only one of these rows is returned in our query.
We can also wrap the <b>UNIQUE()</b> function around more advanced queries.
For example, we could use the following query to return only unique rows where the team is equal to A or B:
<b>=UNIQUE(QUERY(A1:B16, "SELECT A, B WHERE A='A' OR A='B'"))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:

Notice that the only rows returned are the ones where the value in the “Team” column is equal to Mavs, Magic, Kings, or Lakers.
You can also use similar syntax to query for rows where a column contains one of several numeric values.
For example, we can use the following query to return all rows where the value in the “Points” column is equal to 19, 20, or 22:
<b>=QUERY(A1:C11, "SELECT * WHERE C MATCHES '(19|20|22)'")

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Rank Items by Multiple Columns</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to rank items by multiple columns in Google Sheets:
<b>=RANK(B2,$B$2:$B$11)+SUMPRODUCT(--($B$2:$B$11=$B2),--(C2&lt;$C$2:$C$11))</b>
This particular formula ranks items in descending order first by the values in column B, then by the values in column C.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Rank Items by Multiple Columns in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the points and assists for 10 different basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rankmultiple1.jpg"488">
Now suppose we’d like to rank these players from best to worst, assigning a value of “1” to the best player and “10” to the worst player.
We’ll rank the players from best to worst based on the value in the <b>Points</b> column. If there are ties, we’ll then refer to the value in the <b>Assists</b> column.
We’ll use the following formula to rank the players:
<b>=RANK(B2,$B$2:$B$11)+SUMPRODUCT(--($B$2:$B$11=$B2),--(C2&lt;$C$2:$C$11))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rankmultiple2.jpg"672">
The player with a ranking of 1 is considered the best and the player with a ranking of 10 is considered the worst.
Here’s how our formula worked:
Rank the players from best to worst based on the value in the <b>Points</b> column.
If there are ties, refer to the value in the <b>Assists</b> column.
For example, players A and B tied for having the most points. However, player A had more assists so they received a ranking of <b>1</b> and player B received a ranking of <b>2</b>.
Note that any players who had identical values for <b>Points</b> and <b>Assists</b> (like players E and F) received the same ranking.
If you’d like to rank the players in <b>ascending</b> order (1=worst, 10 =best) then we can use the following formula:
<b>=RANK(B2,$B$2:$B$11, 1)+SUMPRODUCT(--($B$2:$B$11=$B2),--(C2&lt;$C$2:$C$11))+1</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rankmultiple3.jpg"669">
The “best” player now has a ranking of <b>10</b> and the “worst” player has a ranking of <b>1</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Remove Non-Numeric Characters from Cell</span></h2>

<h2><span class="orange">How to Replace Blank Cells with Zero in Google Sheets</span></h2>
The easiest way to replace blank cells with zeros in Google Sheets is to use the <b>Find and replace</b> function within the <b>Edit</b> tab.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Replace Blank Cells with Zero in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following data that shows the points scored by various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/replace21.png">
Suppose we would like to replace the blank cells in the Points column with zeros.
To do so, click the <b>Edit</b> tab and then click <b>Find and replace</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/replace22.png">

<b>#replace #N/A with zero
=IFERROR(FORMULA, "0")
#replace #N/A with blank
=IFERROR(FORMULA, "") 
</b>
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice to replace #N/A values from a VLOOKUP with zero or blanks.
<b>Related:</b>  How to Replace Blank Cells with Zero in Google Sheets 
<h3>Example: Replace #N/A Values in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the team name and points scored for various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sheetsreplace1.jpg"457">
And suppose we use the <b>VLOOKUP()</b> function to look up points based on team name:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sheetsreplace2.jpg"561">
Notice that some of the values returned in the <b>VLOOKUP()</b> are <b>#N/A</b> values.
We can turn these values into zeros by using the <b>IFERROR()</b> function as follows:
<b>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, $A$2:$B$11, 2, FALSE), "0")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this function in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sheetsreplace3.jpg">
Notice that the <b>VLOOKUP()</b> function now returns 0 instead of <b>#N/A</b> values.
Alternatively, we can turn the <b>#N/A</b> values into blanks using the <b>IFERROR()</b> function as follows:
<b>#replace #N/A with blank
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, $A$2:$B$11, 2, FALSE), "")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this function in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sheetsreplace4.jpg"570">
Notice that each value that was previously <b>#N/A</b> is now blank.
It’s worth noting that we can use the <b>IFERROR()</b> function to replace <b>#N/A</b> values with any value that we’d like.
In the previous examples we simply replaced <b>#N/A</b> values with zeros or blanks because these are the most common replacement values used in practice.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Select Every Nth Row in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to select every nth row in Google Sheets:
<b>=OFFSET($A$1,(ROW()-1)*n,0)
</b>
This formula selects every <b>nth</b> row.
Simply change the value for n in the formula to select specific rows.
For example, you can use the following formula to select every <b>3rd</b> row:
<b>=OFFSET($A$1,(ROW()-1)*3,0)</b>
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Select Every Nth Row in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of values in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/everyn1.jpg"508">
We can use the following formula to select every <b>third</b> row from the list:
<b>=OFFSET($A$1,(ROW()-1)*3,0)</b>
We will type this formula into cell <b>C1</b> and then copy and paste it to the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/everyn2.jpg"520">
Notice that every third row has been selected from the list of original values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/everyn3.jpg"537">
If we change the value of <b>n</b> in the formula, we can select a different nth value.
For example, we can use the following formula to select every <b>fifth </b>row from the list:
<b>=OFFSET($A$1,(ROW()-1)*5,0)</b>
We will type this formula into cell <b>C1</b> and then copy and paste it to the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/everyn4.jpg"513">

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Use SEQUENCE Function</span></h2>
You can use the <b>SEQUENCE </b>function in Google Sheets to return an array of sequential numbers.
This function uses the following basic syntax:
<b>SEQUENCE(rows, columns, start, step)</b>
where:
<b>rows</b>: The number of rows to return
<b>columns</b>: The number of columns to return (default is 1)
<b>start</b>: The number to start the sequence at (default is 1)
<b>step</b>: The amount to increase or decrease each number in the sequence (default is 1)
The following examples show to use this function in different scenarios in Google Sheets.
<h3>Example 1: Create Sequence of Values in One Column</h3>
We can use the following formula to create a sequence of values in one column:
<b>SEQUENCE(10)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/seq1.jpg"492">
The result is a single column that contains the sequential values 1 through 10.
<h3>Example 2: Create Sequence of Values in One Row</h3>
We can use the following formula to create a sequence of values in one row:
<b>SEQUENCE(1, 5)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/seq2.jpg"555">
The result is a single row that contains the sequential values 1 through 5.
<h3>Example 3: Create Matrix of Sequential Values</h3>
We can use the following formula to create a matrix of values with <b>10</b> rows, <b>3</b> columns, starts at <b>0</b>, and increases each value by <b>5</b>:
<b>SEQUENCE(10, 3, 0, 5)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/seq3.jpg">
The result is a matrix with 10 rows, 3 columns, starts at 0, and increases each value by 5.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Sort and Ignore Blanks</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to sort rows in Google Sheets while ignoring rows with a blank value in a particular column:
<b>=QUERY(A1:B11,"select * where B is not null order by B")
</b>
This particular formula sorts the rows in the range <b>A1:B11</b> by column <b>B</b>, ignoring any rows with a blank value in column <b>B</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Sort and Ignore Blanks in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sortblank1.jpg"476">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D1</b> to sort the rows of the dataset based on the value in the <b>Points</b> column, while simply ignoring any rows that have a blank value in the <b>Points</b> column:
<b>=QUERY(A1:B11,"select * where B is not null order by B")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sortblank2.jpg"593">
Notice that the rows have been sorted by the value in the <b>Points</b> column and the rows that contained a blank in the <b>Points</b> column have been ignored.
By default, Google Sheets sorts the data in ascending order.
However, we can use the <b>desc</b> argument to instead sort in a descending order:
<b>=QUERY(A1:B11,"select * where B is not null order by B desc")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sortblank3.jpg"591">
The rows are now sorted in descending order based on the value in the <b>Points</b> column.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Sum Filtered Rows in Google Sheets (With Examples)</span></h2>
The easiest way to take the sum of a filtered range in Google Sheets is to use the following syntax:
<b>SUBTOTAL(109, A1:A10)
</b>
Note that the value 109 is a  shortcut  for taking the sum of a filtered range of rows.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Sum Filtered Rows in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following spreadsheet that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt1.png">
To add a filter to this data, we can highlight cells <b>A1:B10</b>, then click the <b>Data</b> tab, then click <b>Create a filter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt2.png">
We can then click the Filter icon at the top of the Points column and uncheck the box next to the first three values 84, 89, and 93:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt3.png">
Once we click <b>OK</b>, the data will be filtered to remove these values.
If we attempt to use the <b>SUM()</b> function to sum the points column of the filtered rows, it will actually return the sum of all of the original values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt4.png">
Instead, we can use the <b>SUBTOTAL()</b> function:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumFilt5.png">
This function takes the sum of only the visible rows.
We can manually verify this by taking the sum of the visible rows:
Sum of Visible Rows: 99 + 94 + 97 + 104 + 109 + 99 = <b>602</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Sum If Checkbox is Checked</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to sum values in Google Sheets if a corresponding checkbox is checked:
<b>=SUM(ARRAYFORMULA(A2:A11*B2:B11))</b>
This particular formula assumes that the values are in the range <b>A2:A11</b> and the checkboxes are in the range <b>B2:B11</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Sum If Checkbox is Checked in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/checkbox1.jpg"495">
<b>Note</b>: You can add checkboxes to a range of cells by selecting a range, then clicking the <b>Insert</b> tab, then clicking <b>Checkbox</b>.
We can use the following formula to sum only the values in column A where the corresponding checkbox in column B is checked:
<b>=SUM(ARRAYFORMULA(A2:A11*B2:B11))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/checkbox2.jpg">
The sum of the values in column A where the corresponding checkbox in column B is checked is <b>172</b>.
We can confirm this is correct by manually calculating the sum of the values in column A where the corresponding checkbox in column B is checked:
Sum of Checked Checkboxes: 20 + 29 + 26 + 31 + 51 + 15 = <b>172</b>
This matches the value that we calculated using the formula.

Suppose we attempt to use the <b>SUM()</b> function to sum the time durations in column C:
<b>=SUM(C2:C8)</b>
It turns out that this formula will actually reset the sum to 0 each time the sum of the durations surpasses 24 hours:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sumtime2.jpg"587">
Instead, we need to use the following formula to calculate the sum of the durations:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Use SUMIF with Multiple Columns</span></h2>
The <b>SUMIFS()</b> function in Google Sheets can be used to sum values that meet criteria in multiple columns.
This function uses the following syntax:
<b>SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criterion1, criteria_range2, criterion2, …)</b>
where:
<b>sum_range</b>: The range of cells to sum.
<b>criteria_range1</b>: The first range of cells to look at.

<h3>Example: Use SUMIFS with Date Range in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the number of products sold on various days:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/countifs1.png">
We can define a start and end date in cells <b>D2</b> and <b>E2</b> respectively, then use the following formula to calculate the sum of the products sold between these two dates:
<b>=SUMIFS(B2:B11,A2:A11,">="&D2,A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumifs11.jpg">
We can see that a total of <b>73</b> products were sold between 1/10/2021 and 1/15/2021.
We can manually verify that this number of products were sold during the three dates in column A that fall within the date range:
1/12/2021: 28 products
1/14/2021: 30 products
1/15/2021: 15 products
Total products sold: 28 + 30 + 15 = <b>73</b>.
If we change either the start or end date, the formula will automatically update to count the cells within the new date range.
For example, suppose we change the start date to 1/1/2021:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumifs12.jpg"669">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate a Time Difference in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to calculate a time difference between two times in Google Sheets:
<b>=B1-A1
</b>
This particular formula assumes the starting time is in cell <b>A1</b> and the ending time is in cell <b>B1</b>.
In order for this formula to work properly, the cells in A1 and B1 must both have a <b>Date time</b> format.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Calculating a Time Difference in Google Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following two columns in Google Sheets that show the start and end time of some events:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timediff1.jpg"537">
Before calculating the time difference for each event, we must make sure that the times are in a Date time format.
To do so, highlight the cells in the range <b>A2:B5</b> and then click the <b>Format</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click <b>Number</b>, then click <b>Date time</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timediff2.jpg"1828">
Each of the times will automatically be converted to a Date time format:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timediff3.jpg"513">
Next, we can simply subtract the start times from the end times:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timediff4.jpg"555">
To convert the time difference to a time format, highlight the cells in the range <b>C2:C5</b>, then click the <b>Format</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click <b>Number</b>, then click <b>Duration</b>.
The time differences will automatically be converted into a Hours: Minutes: Seconds format.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timediff5.jpg">
If you’d like to extract the individual hours, minutes, and seconds from the time difference, you can use the <b>HOUR</b>, <b>MINUTE</b>, and <b>SECOND</b> functions:

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Quickly Convert Time to Decimal</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to convert a time to a decimal in Google Sheets:
<b>=HOUR(B2)+(MINUTE(B2)/60) + (SECOND(B2)/3600)

This particular formula converts the time in cell B2 to a decimal.
For example, if the time is <b>4:19:34</b> then the formula will convert this to <b>4.3261</b> so that the time is represented as 4.3261 hours.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Convert Time to Decimal in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the number of hours, minutes, and seconds it took various athletes to finish a competition:

We can use the following formula to convert the durations into a decimal format:
<b>=HOUR(B2)+(MINUTE(B2)/60) + (SECOND(B2)/3600)</b>
We will type this formula into cell <b>C2</b> and then click and drag the formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dec2.jpg">
The new <b>Decimal</b> column displays the time in the <b>Duration</b> column as a decimal.
For example:
A duration of 4 hours, 13 minutes, and 0 seconds is converted to <b>4.2167</b> hours.
A duration of 13 hours, 30 minutes, and 15 seconds is converted to <b>13.5041</b> hours.
A duration of 2 hours, 15 minutes, and 0 seconds is converted to <b>2.25 </b>hours.
And so on.
If you would instead like to display the durations in terms of number of days, you can divide the entire formula by 24:
<b>=(HOUR(B2)+(MINUTE(B2)/60) + (SECOND(B2)/3600)) / 24</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dec3.jpg"557">
The new <b>Decimal</b> column displays the time in the <b>Duration</b> column as a number of days.
For example:
A duration of 4 hours, 13 minutes, and 0 seconds is converted to <b>.1756 </b>days.
A duration of 13 hours, 30 minutes, and 15 seconds is converted to <b>.5626 </b>days.
A duration of 2 hours, 15 minutes, and 0 seconds is converted to <b>.09375 </b>days.

Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information for various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/uniquemultiple11.jpg"486">
We can use the following formula to return only the unique rows across both columns:
<b>=UNIQUE(A2:B11)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/uniquemultiple12.jpg"549">
Notice that the formula only returns the unique rows from the original dataset.
<h3>Example 2: Create Unique List of Values (Display in One Column)</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains the positions of players on various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/uniquemultiple13.jpg"567">
We can use the following formula to find the unique values across all three columns and display the results in one column:
<b>=UNIQUE(FLATTEN(A2:C6))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/uniquemultiple14.jpg"577">
Notice that the formula only returns the unique positions across each of the three columns.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Create and Use Variables in Google Sheets</span></h2>
The easiest way to create variables that you can reference in formulas in Google Sheets is to use the <b>Name box</b> to give custom names to cells.
The following example shows how to do so in practice.
<h2>Example: Create and Use Variables in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following information about the number of units sold, the unit price, and the unit cost for some store:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sheetsvar1.jpg"466">
To calculate the total revenue for this store, we can use the following formula:
Total Revenue = Units Sold * (Unit Price – Unit Cost)
We could type the following formula into cell <b>B4</b> to calculate this value:
<b>=B1*(B2-B3) 
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sheetsvar2.jpg"452">
From the output we can see that the total revenue is $60.
However, we could also create variable names for the cells and then use the variable names in the formula to calculate the total revenue.
To do so, click on cell <b>B1</b>. Then click the <b>Name box</b> in the top left corner:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sheetsvar3.jpg"509">
Then type any custom name you’d like.
For this example, we’ll type <b>units_sold</b> and then press <b>Enter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sheetsvar4.jpg"469">
We’ll repeat this process with cell <b>B2</b> and <b>B3</b>, using the names <b>unit_price</b> and <b>unit_cost</b> as the variable names.
Now we can type the following formula into cell <b>B4</b> to calculate the total revenue, using only the variable names in the formula:
<b>=units_sold*(unit_price-unit_cost)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sheetsvar5.jpg"475">
From the output we can see that the total revenue is $60.
This matches the value that we calculated earlier using the cell references in the formula.
Note that in this scenario we used a simple formula that only involved three variables, but in practice you can give custom names to as many cells as you’d like so that you can use as many variable names in a formula that you need.
Also note that the variable names we defined on one sheet can be used in a different sheet within the same Google Sheets workbook.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Use VLOOKUP by Date</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to use a VLOOKUP by date in Google Sheets:
<b>=VLOOKUP(D2, A2:B9, 2, FALSE)
</b>
This particular formula looks up the date in cell <b>D2</b> in the range<b> A2:B9</b> and returns the corresponding value in column <b>2</b> of the range.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>FALSE</b> argument tells Google Sheets to look for exact matches instead of approximate matches.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use VLOOKUP by Date in Google Sheets</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows the total sales of some product on various dates:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vlookupdate1.jpg"491">
We can use the following formula with <b>VLOOKUP</b> to look up the date value in cell D2 in column A and return the corresponding sales value in column B:
<b>=VLOOKUP(D2, A2:B9, 2, FALSE)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vlookupdate2.jpg">
The <b>VLOOKUP</b> formula returns 12, which is the sales value that corresponds to the date 5/26/2022 in the original dataset.
Note that this formula assumes the values in column A are in a valid date format and that the value we supply to the <b>VLOOKUP</b> formula is also in a valid date format.
If the value that we supply to the <b>VLOOKUP</b> formula is not valid, then the formula will simply return <b>#N/A</b> as a result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vlookupdate3.jpg"567">
Since 5.26.2022 is not a valid date format, the <b>VLOOKUP</b> formula returns <b>#N/A</b> as a result.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: How to Use VLOOKUP From Another Workbook</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to perform a VLOOKUP from another workbook in Google Sheets:
<b>=VLOOKUP(A2, IMPORTRANGE("1AdlE5drC", "'sheet1'!$A$1:$B$11"), 2, 0)</b>
This particular formula will look up the value in cell <b>A2</b> of the current workbook in the range <b>A1:B11</b> of a second workbook that has a spreadsheet key of <b>1AdlE5drC</b> and return the corresponding value in the second column.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Step 1: Enter Data into Both Workbooks</h2>
Suppose our current workbook contains the following data:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ga1.jpg"558">
And suppose we have another workbook with the following data:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ga2.jpg"542">
<h2>Step 2: Perform VLOOKUP Between Workbooks</h2>
Now suppose we would like to use a VLOOKUP in the first workbook to look up the team names in the second workbook and return the corresponding value in the Assists column.
Before we perform this VLOOKUP, we must find the spreadsheet key in the URL of the second workbook:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ga3.jpg"675">
We can then type the following formula into cell C2 of the first workbook:
<b>=VLOOKUP(A2, IMPORTRANGE("1_W-W0fbIYl74Kp2y5ruaGyFjWOskrcPBdQ6Vk_t_dRQ", "'sheet1'!$A$1:$B$11"), 2, 0)</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, the value in the Assists column from the second workbook that corresponds to the “Mavs” team will be shown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ga4.jpg"492">
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C to find the Assists values for each team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ga5.jpg"515">
The values in the Assists column of the second workbook have now all been pulled into the first workbook.

 Google Sheets: How to Use IMPORTRANGE with Conditions 
 Google Sheets: Use VLOOKUP with Multiple Criteria 
<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Use VLOOKUP with Multiple Criteria</span></h2>
Often you may want to use VLOOKUP in Google Sheets to look up values based on multiple criteria.
For example, suppose we have the following two datasets and you would like to use VLOOKUP in the right dataset to return the value in the <b>Points</b> column that matches both the value in the <b>Team</b> column and the <b>Position</b> column in the left dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/vlookup1.jpg"669">
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so.
<h2>Step 1: Create a Helper Column</h2>
Before we can perform the VLOOKUP, we must first create a helper column in the first dataset that joins together the values in the <b>Team</b> and <b>Points</b> columns.
We’ll type the following formula into cell <b>A2</b>:
<b>=B2&C2</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column A:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/vlookup2.jpg"470">
Column A now contains a concatenation of the <b>Team</b> and <b>Position</b> values.
We will use this new column in our VLOOKUP formula in the next step.
<h2>Step 2: Use VLOOKUP with Multiple Criteria</h2>
Next, we can type the following formula into cell <b>I2</b>:
<b>=VLOOKUP(F2&G2, $A$2:$D$13, 4, FALSE)</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column I:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/vlookup3.jpg">
This formula looks up the concatenation of the text values in columns <b>F</b> and <b>G</b> in column <b>A</b> and returns the corresponding value in column <b>D</b>.
Notice that the points value for each player in the right dataset matches the points value for the corresponding player in the left dataset.
We have successfully used a VLOOKUP with multiple criteria.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Use VLOOKUP to Return All Matches</span></h2>
By default, the <b>VLOOKUP</b> function in Google Sheets looks up some value in a range and returns a corresponding value <em>only for the first match</em>.
However, you can use the following syntax with to look up some value in a range and return corresponding values for <em>all matches</em>:
<b>=FILTER(C2:C11, E2=A2:A11)</b>
This particular formula looks in the range <b>C2:C11</b> and returns the corresponding values in the range <b>A2:A11</b> for <em>all rows</em> where the value in <b>C2:C11</b> is equal to <b>E2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use VLOOKUP to Return All Matches</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/all1.jpg"480">
Suppose we use the following formula with <b>VLOOKUP</b> to look up the team “Rockets” in column A and return the corresponding points value in column C:
<b>=VLOOKUP(E2, A2:C11, 3, FALSE)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/all2.jpg"651">
The <b>VLOOKUP</b> function returns the value in the “Points” column for the first occurrence of Rockets in the “Team” column, but it fails to return the points values for the other two rows that also contain Rockets in the “Team” column.
To return the points values for all rows that contain Rockets in the “Team” column, we can use the <b>FILTER</b> function instead.
Here’s the exact formula we can use:
<b>=FILTER(C2:C11, E2=A2:A11)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/all3.jpg"661">
Notice that the <b>FILTER</b> function returns all three points values for the three rows where the “Team” column contains Rockets.

<h2><span class="orange">Google Sheets: Use VLOOKUP to Return Multiple Columns</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax with the <b>VLOOKUP</b> function in Google Sheets to look up a value in a range and return the corresponding values from multiple columns:
<b>=ArrayFormula(VLOOKUP(A14, A2:D11, {2, 4}, FALSE))
</b>
This particular formula looks up the value in cell <b>A14</b> in the range<b> A2:D11</b> and returns the corresponding values in columns <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> of the range.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>FALSE</b> argument tells Google Sheets to look for exact matches instead of approximate matches.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use VLOOKUP to Return Multiple Columns</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Google Sheets that shows information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mult1.jpg"579">
We can use the following formula with <b>VLOOKUP</b> to look up the team “Blazers” in column A and return the corresponding values for points and rebounds:
<b>=ArrayFormula(VLOOKUP(A14, A2:D11, {2, 4}, FALSE))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mult2.jpg">
The <b>VLOOKUP</b> formula returns the values in the points and rebounds columns for the row where the team contains “Blazers” in the name.
Note that if we change the team name in cell <b>A14</b>, the formula will automatically find the points and rebounds values for the new team.
For example, suppose we change the team name to Warriors:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mult3.jpg"573">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate a Weighted Average in Google Sheets</span></h2>
You can use one of the following methods to calculate a weighted average in Google Sheets:
<b>Method 1: Use AVERAGE.WEIGHTED</b>
<b>=AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(B2:B5, C2:C5)
</b>
<b>Method 2: Use SUMPRODUCT</b>
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(B2:B5, C2:C5)/SUM(C2:C5)</b>
Both formulas assume the values are in the range <b>B2:B5</b> and the weights are in the range <b>C2:C5</b>.
Both formulas will return the same results, but the <b>AVERAGE.WEIGHTED</b> method requires less typing.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Google Sheets:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wa1.jpg"482">
<h2>Example 1: Calculate Weighted Average Using AVERAGE.WEIGHTED</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b> to calculate the weighted average of exam scores for this particular student:
<b>=AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(B2:B5, C2:C5)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wa2.jpg">
From the output we can see that the weighted average of exam scores is <b>79.5</b>.
Here’s how the <b>AVERAGE.WEIGHTED</b> formula actually calculated this value:
Weighted Average = (90*.15 + 80*.15 + 85*.15 + 75*.55) / (.15 + .15 + .15 + .55) = <b>79.5</b>.
<h2>Example 2: Calculate Weighted Average Using SUMPRODUCT</h2>
We could also type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b> to calculate the weighted average of exam scores for this particular student:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(B2:B5, C2:C5)/SUM(C2:C5)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wa3.jpg"571">

</b>
where:
<b>start_date</b>: The start date
<b>end_date:</b> The end date
<b>holidays</b>: A list of holiday dates to skip when counting (optional)

<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform a Granger-Causality Test in Python</span></h2>
The <b>Granger Causality test</b> is used to determine whether or not one time series is useful for forecasting another.
This test uses the following null and alternative hypotheses:
<b>Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):</b> Time series <em>x</em> does not Granger-cause time series <em>y</em>
<b>Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>):</b> Time series <em>x</em> Granger-causes time series <em>y</em>
The term “Granger-causes” means that knowing the value of time series <em>x</em> at a certain lag is useful for predicting the value of time series <em>y</em> at a later time period.
This test produces an F test statistic with a corresponding  p-value . If the p-value is less than a certain significance level (i.e. α = .05), then we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that we have sufficient evidence to say that time series <em>x</em> Granger-causes time series y.
We can use the  grangercausalitytests()  function from the statsmodels package to perform a Granger-Causality test in Python:
<b>from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests
#perform Granger-Causality test
grangercausalitytests(df[['column1', 'column2']], maxlag=[3])
</b>
Note that <b>maxlag</b> indicates the number of lags to use in the first time series.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Step 1: Load the Data</h3>
For this example, we’ll use a dataset that contains values for the number of eggs manufactured along with the number of chickens in the U.S. from 1930 to 1983:
<b>import pandas as pd
#define URL where dataset is located
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Statology/Miscellaneous/main/chicken_egg.txt"
#read in dataset as pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep="  ")
#view first five rows of DataFrame
df.head()
yearchickenegg

119314497433532
219324368153327
319334445233255
419344339373156
</b>
<b>Related:</b>  How to Read CSV Files with Pandas 
<h3>Step 2: Perform the Granger-Causality Test</h3>
Next, we’ll use the <b>grangercausalitytests()</b> function to perform a Granger-Causality test to see if the number of eggs manufactured is predictive of the future number of chickens. We’ll run the test using three lags:
<b>from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests
#perform Granger-Causality test
grangercausalitytests(df[['chicken', 'egg']], maxlag=[3])
Granger Causality
number of lags (no zero) 3
ssr based F test:         F=5.4050  , p=0.0030  , df_denom=44, df_num=3
ssr based chi2 test:   chi2=18.7946 , p=0.0003  , df=3
likelihood ratio test: chi2=16.0003 , p=0.0011  , df=3
parameter F test:         F=5.4050  , p=0.0030  , df_denom=44, df_num=3</b>
The F test statistic turns out to be <b>5.405</b> and the corresponding p-value is <b>0.0030</b>.
Since the p-value is less than .05, we can reject the null hypothesis of the test and conclude that knowing the number of eggs is useful for predicting the future number of chickens.
<h3>Step 3: Perform the Granger-Causality Test in Reverse</h3>
Although we rejected the null hypothesis of the test, it’s actually possible that there is a case of reverse causation happening. That is, it’s possible that the number of chickens is causing the number of eggs to change.
To rule out this possibility, we need to perform the Granger-Causality test in reverse, using chickens as the predictor variable and eggs as the  response variable :
<b>from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests
#perform Granger-Causality test
grangercausalitytests(df[['egg', 'chicken']], maxlag=[3])

</b>
The F test statistic turns out to be <b>0.5916</b> and the corresponding p-value is <b>0.6238</b>.
Since the p-value isn’t less than .05, we can’t reject the null hypothesis. That is, the number of chickens isn’t predictive of the future number of eggs.
Thus, we can conclude that knowing the number of eggs is useful for predicting the future number of chickens.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform a Granger-Causality Test in R</span></h2>
The <b>Granger Causality test</b> is used to determine whether or not one time series is useful for forecasting another.
This test uses the following null and alternative hypotheses:
<b>Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):</b> Time series <em>x</em> does not Granger-cause time series <em>y</em>
<b>Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>):</b> Time series <em>x</em> Granger-causes time series <em>y</em>
The term “Granger-causes” means that knowing the value of time series <em>x</em> at a certain lag is useful for predicting the value of time series <em>y</em> at a later time period.
This test produces an F test statistic with a corresponding p-value. If the p-value is less than a certain significance level (i.e. α = .05), then we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that we have sufficient evidence to say that time series <em>x</em> Granger-causes time series y.
To perform a Granger-Causality test in R, we can use the <b>grangertest()</b> function from the  lmtest  package, which uses the following syntax:
<b>grangertest(x, y, order = 1)</b>
where:
<b>x:</b> The first time series
<b>y:</b> The second time series
<b>order:</b> The number of lags to use in the first time series. Default is 1.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Step 1: Define the Two Time Series</h3>
For this example, we’ll use the <b>ChickEgg</b> dataset that comes pre-loaded in the lmtest package. This dataset contains values for the number of eggs manufactured along with the number of chickens in the U.S. from 1930 to 1983:
<b>#load lmtest package
library(lmtest)
#load ChickEgg dataset
data(ChickEgg)
#view first six rows of dataset
head(ChickEgg)
     chicken  egg
[1,]  468491 3581
[2,]  449743 3532
[3,]  436815 3327
[4,]  444523 3255
[5,]  433937 3156
[6,]  389958 3081</b>
<h3>Step 2: Perform the Granger-Causality Test</h3>
Next, we’ll use the <b>grangertest()</b> function to perform a Granger-Causality test to see if the number of eggs manufactured is predictive of the future number of chickens. We’ll run the test using three lags:
<b>#perform Granger-Causality test
grangertest(chicken ~ egg, order = 3, data = ChickEgg)
Granger causality test
Model 1: chicken ~ Lags(chicken, 1:3) + Lags(egg, 1:3)
Model 2: chicken ~ Lags(chicken, 1:3)
  Res.Df Df     F   Pr(>F)   
1     44                     
2     47 -3 5.405 0.002966 **
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
</b>
Here is how to intrepret the output:
<b>Model 1:</b> This model attempts to predict the number of chickens using the number of chickens in the previous three years and the number of eggs in the previous three years as predictor variables.
<b>Model 2:</b> This model attempts to predict the number of chickens using only the number of chickens in the previous three years as predictor variables.
<b>F:</b> This is the F test statistic. It turns out to be 5.405.
<b>Pr(>F):</b> This is the p-value that corresponds to the F test statistic. It turns out to be .002966.
Since the p-value is less than .05, we can reject the null hypothesis of the test and conclude that knowing the number of eggs is useful for predicting the future number of chickens.
<h3>Step 3: Perform the Granger-Causality Test in Reverse</h3>
Although we rejected the null hypothesis of the test, it’s actually possible that there is a case of reverse causation happening. That is, it’s possible that the number of chickens is causing the number of eggs to change.
To rule out this possibility, we need to perform the Granger-Causality test in reverse, using chickens as the predictor variable and eggs as the  response variable :
<b>#perform Granger-Causality test in reverse
grangertest(egg ~ chicken, order = 3, data = ChickEgg)
Granger causality test
Model 1: egg ~ Lags(egg, 1:3) + Lags(chicken, 1:3)
Model 2: egg ~ Lags(egg, 1:3)
  Res.Df Df      F Pr(>F)
1     44                 
2     47 -3 0.5916 0.6238
</b>
The p-value of the test is 0.6238. Since this isn’t less than .05, we can’t reject the null hypothesis. That is, the number of chickens isn’t predictive of the future number of eggs.
Thus, we can conclude that knowing the number of eggs is useful for predicting the future number of chickens.
