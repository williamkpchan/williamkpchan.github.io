<h2>Understanding configuration variables </h1>


<b>What are these things called <i>configuration variables</i>?</b><br />
A <i>configuration variable</i> is a storage item that contains data which can change during the execution (launch) of MicroStation and is defined by the following syntax: <i>[VARIABLE_NAME] [operator] [value] [# comment]</i><br />
<br />
For example: <i>MS_CELLLIST = d:/Production/Cells/</i><br />
<br />
Where <i>MS_CELLLIST</i> is the variable_name<br />
<i>=</i> is the operator<br />
<i>d:/Production/Cells/</i> is the value.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Are there different kinds of variables?</b><br />
Sure thing....MicroStation access and uses a <a class="ExistingPageLink" href="/communities/other_communities/askinga/w/askinga/1053/the-types-of-configuration-variables" title="单击查看具有以下标题的页面:The types of configuration variables ">variety of variables</a>, additionally, MicroStation and other programs may also access <i>environment variables</i> in your are set at the operating system level.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Where are the variables set?</b><br />
MicroStation&#39;s variables are set via a number of cascading configuration files which are loaded in a very specific order when you <a class="ExistingPageLink" href="/communities/other_communities/askinga/w/askinga/1050/what-happens-when-you-launch-microstation" title="单击查看具有以下标题的页面:What happens when you launch MicroStation?">launch MicroStation</a>. Inside of each of these configuration files, you&#39;ll find dozens of variables directing MicroStation on where to look for specific files, specific folders and specific settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>How can I view my variables?</b><br />
There are a number of ways to view and determine what your configuration variables are including just opening any configuration file with a text based editor.<br />
<br />
A simple example is the following snippet from a delivered project configuration file: 
</p>

<img src="https://communities.bentley.com/askIngaPics/200Pic1.jpg">
<br>
<p>
<b>Ok, I&#39;ve just looked at some of the variables and see some wierd syntax like <i>&lt;&gt;</i> and<i> = </i>. What&#39;s with that?</b><br />
What you&#39;re seeing are things called <a class="ExistingPageLink" href="/communities/other_communities/askinga/w/askinga/1055/configuration-variable-operators" title="单击查看具有以下标题的页面:Configuration variable operators ">configuration variable operators</a> which define how MicroStation will process each variable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Are those different than the <i>%if</i> and <i>%endif</i> things I see in <i>msconfig.cfg</i>?</b><br />
Yep, those are <a class="ExistingPageLink" href="/communities/other_communities/askinga/w/askinga/1049/preprocessor-directives-for-processing-configuration-files" title="单击查看具有以下标题的页面:Preprocessor directives for processing configuration files ">preprocessor directives</a> for processing the configuration files.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>I&#39;ve also seen something that looks like this: <i>$(variable_name)</i> and <i>${variable_name}</i>. What are those?</b><br />
Those are directives that allow you to <a class="ExistingPageLink" href="/communities/other_communities/askinga/w/askinga/1209/referencing-other-configuration-variables" title="单击查看具有以下标题的页面:Referencing other configuration variables ">refer to other</a> pre-defined variables. Using this method can eliminate the need for creating new and possibly redundant variables and can also streamline how MicroStatio resolves variables.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Why are configuration variables in CAPS?</b><br />
Although it&#39;s not a requirement, it allows the reader to view and locate them easier within the configuration files.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Why do some start with <i>MS</i> and others with <i>_USTN</i>?</b><br />
The variables that start with <i>MS</i> will be seen in the dialog when you go <i>Workspace &gt; Configuration</i> while the ones that start with an underscore ie: <i>_USTN</i> won&#39;t....well, by default anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Sounds fishy. Can I do something so that I can see the <i>_USTN</i> ones?</b><br />
Sure thing, just set this variable <i>_USTN_DISPLAYALLCFGVARS = 1</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Wow! is there anything else you can share?</b><br />
Yeah, to finish this article off, here&#39;s a little list of pointers to keep in mind: 
</p>
<ul><li>Nearly all variable names used by MicroStation begin with <i>MS_</i> or <i>_USTN_</i></li>
<li>By default, variables whose names begin with <i>_USTN</i> are not displayed in the <i>Configuration Variables</i> dialog box.</li>
<li>Variable names can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9) and must be at least two characters long. </li>
<li>Although variable names are not case sensitive, uppercase letters are used by convention.</li>
<li>As a practical matter keep variable names under 32 characters.</li>
<li>All configuration files must have a carriage return after the last line. Note that this has been fixed in MicroStation 08.09.03.xx</li>
<li>On all platforms, path names should be entered using the forward slash (/).</li>
<li>When creating variables in the <i>Configuration Variable</i> dialog, all forward slashes (/) in <i>new_value</i> field are converted to backslashes (\).</li>
<li>All directory definitions must end with a trailing forward slash.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Copy User Preferences and User Configuration Files to a new or different PC</h2>

<p>This article&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;at experienced MicroStation users who are comfortable in working with Windows file browsers and MicroStation configuration files.</p>
<p>Please note that .upf file should be copied only if both the source and target PCs have the exact same release of MicroStation installed. Should this not be the case, the user preferences should be set on the new PC from scratch, in order to avoid any possible incompatibility.</p>
<h3>Steps to Accomplish</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Copying the User Preferences (.upf) file</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">On source PC, open MicroStation with any file (please note the name of the user in MicroStation manager) and open&nbsp;&nbsp;the key-in panel (menu Utilities-&gt;Key-in)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Type the following key-in: <span class="notranslate">$ % explorer $(_USTN_HOMEPREFS)</span> - This will open Windows explorer showing the content of your user preferences folder</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Copy the content of this folder to a usb stick or to a networked folder, accessible by both PCs.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Repeat point (1) and (2) on the Target PC</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">CLOSE all instances of MicroStation but keep the Windows explorer window open.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Delete the content of this folder and replace it with the data saved on the usb stick or in the networked folder at point (3)</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Copying the User Configuration&nbsp;(.ucf) file:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">On source PC, open MicroStation with any file (please note the name of the user in MicroStation manager) and open the key-in panel (menu Utilities-&gt;Key-in)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Type the following key-in: <span class="notranslate">$ % explorer $(_USTN_USER)</span> - This will open Windows explorer showing the content of your User folder</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Copy the .ucf file corresponding to the User name noted at point (1) of previous procedure to a usb stick or to a networked folder, accessible by both PCs</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="LEFT">Repeat point (1) and (2) on the Target PC and copy the .ucf file just copied in the source PC user folder.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p align="LEFT">When you restart MicroStation you should see the old &quot;User&quot; available in MicroStation Manager. If you haven&#39;t changed any variables and are using an unchanged &quot;untitled&quot; user, then you do not need to carry out the procedure above.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>MS_PLTDLG_ENABLE_ORIENTATION</td>
<td>The orientation control on the print dialog allows you to quickly reverse the X&amp;Y values of the paper size record without having to edit the .plt file.

To reduce confusion and prevent any accidental swapping of the X&amp;Y sizes, the orientation control is disabled by default for Bentley Printer drivers. You may control this behavior by using the variable.
<p>Valid values are:</p>

<td>MS_PLTDLG_PREVIEW_ORIENTATION</td>
<td>By default, MicroStation displays the preview window with the same orientation as the design, regardless of the orientation of the paper size definition. This prevents you from having to twist your head when previewing landscape designs maximized to portrait-oriented forms. You can use MS_PLTDLG_PREVIEW_ORIENTATION to change this behavior, as may be desired when working with portrait designs and landscape forms.
<p>Recognized values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DESIGN: the preview will use the orientation of the design (default behavior).</li>
<li>PAPER: the preview will use the orientation of the paper size definition.</li>
<li>LANDSCAPE: the preview use landscape orientation.</li>
<li>PORTRAIT: the preview use portrait orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the preview is displayed in a different orientation than that indicated by the orientation radio button, then the preview display of &#39;rotate 90&#39; will be reversed as well. This variable does not apply to system printers.</p>

If the paper size of the object is larger than 4096 dots, the MFB is scaled accordingly. That can reduce the sharpness of the image. For sharper plotted OLE objects at the expense of memory usage, processing time, and plot file size, you may set MS_PLT_OLE_MAX_MFB_SIZE. The valid range is 1024 through 16384 (units are pixels).
