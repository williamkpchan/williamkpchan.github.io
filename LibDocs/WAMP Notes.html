<h2>Some explanations on how Wampserver works</h2>

Right-clicking on this icon gives you access to:

- About: used versions and other information
- Refresh: Re-creates the wampmanager.ini file
- Help: Accessing the Wampserser Help Forums
- Language: Change the language used
- Wamp parameters: Allows you to modify certain Wampserver options
- Tools: Utilities for problem solving
- Close: Required to Quit Wampserver. 

Must be done BEFORE closing Windows to allow
dumping of PHP, MySQL and MariaDB caches and avoid data loss.

Left-clicking on this icon gives you access to:

- Displays the numbers of the used versions
- Direct access to the Wampserver homepage (localhost) *See VirtualHost at the end
- Direct access to PhpMyAdmin (MySQL / MariaDB GUI)
- Direct access to Adminer (MySQL / MariaDB GUI)

This two items (MySQL MariaDB) can be enabled or disabled in Wamp Settings.

- Virtualhosts Submenu *See VirtualHost at the end
- Open File Explorer on the www folder
- Different submenus for Apache,
  PHP, MySQL and MariaDB allowing to change version;
  add or remove module loading or extensions;
  modify parameters; administering services for each entity;
  open some files in the default text editor (php.ini, httpd.conf, https-vhosts.conf, my.ini, log files, etc.)

- Services Management: Stop, Start, Restart

--- Launch phpMyAdmin
When starting phpMyAdmin, you will be asked for a user name and password.

After installing Wampserver 3, the default username is "root" (without quotes) and there is no password, which means that you must leave the form Password box empty.

There will be a warning:
You are connected as 'root' with no password, which corresponds to the default MySQL privileged account. 
Your MySQL server is running with this default, is open to intrusion, and you really should fix this security hole by setting a password for user 'root'.

This is not a problem as long as access to Phpmyadmin remain locally.

However, some web applications or CMS asking that the MySQL user has a password. 

In which case, you will create a user with password
via the PhpMyAdmin Accounts Users tab.

--- Support of MariaDB
Read the file "mariadb_support.txt" into the wamp install directory

--- Using the menus and submenus of Wampmanager
Do not use the keyboard to navigate through the menus and submenus of Wampmanager icon.

--- For questions regarding Wampserver 3
Please use the specific forum: http://forum.wampserver.com/list.php?2
Do not use an existing discussion, but create your own thread:
New Topic
after having read READ (and answer) BEFORE YOU ASK A QUESTION in this forum.
If the Wampmanager icon in the taskbar is not GREEN, you can perform a first troubleshooting by following the items in :

TROUBLESHOOTINGS TIPS
(*) VirtualHost

You can see that "localhost" is defined as VirtualHost. 
Why?
Because, even if you are not aware of it, for all hosts, the sites are in VirtualHost. 

You don't see it and don't know it because these VirtualHost existed before you installed your website there and it was the host who took care of their creation.

To avoid any problem, it must be the same locally, you must use VirtualHost for your local sites, even for a local transfer of an existing site already with a host.

If you want to install, locally, CMS such as WordPress or Joomla or any other WEB application, the installation folder and VirtualHost must exist BEFORE installing the CMS or WEB application.

<h2>WAMPserver</h2>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/">WAMPserver 338MB Web development environment for Apache, MySQL, PHP databases</a>
<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/wampserver/">Installing WAMP server</a>
username = root and password is blank
<a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Wordpress Download</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snFzbPm_RUE&t=242s">How to Install WordPress</a>
to run wordpress, install first Necessary Software: PHP, MySQL, Apache, this can be done by installing WAMP once for all three.
After installation, run it, and then create database using phpMyAdmin.
username = root and password is blank

click databases tab
create new database name, OK
then download wordpress zip file
extract it to new folder called wordpress
then find out the localhost directory, by selecting www directory in the wamp icon, D:\wamp64\www
and then move the wordpress folder into the www folder
after that open localhost to open wordpress, in index.html exist in www, rename it to others to stop using the index file
running the wordpress first time will create config file
database name: learnWebpress, this is the setup in phyadmin
user name: root
pw: <blank>
database host: localhost
table prefix: wp_testsite

K.W.K

<h2>MAMP, XAMPP server</h2>

<h2>Apache, Mercury, Tomcat server</h2>
Apache is the Apache Web Server also known as httpd. See http://httpd.apache.org
Mercury SMTP Server
Tomcat is a Servlet Container. See http://tomcat.apache.org

While at the simplest level both can be viewed as web servers that serve static files they have very different focuses.
httpd is typically used to host static content and dynamic content written in perl, php amongst others.
Tomcat is primarily intended to be used to serve web applications developed in Java to the Java Servlet specification.
