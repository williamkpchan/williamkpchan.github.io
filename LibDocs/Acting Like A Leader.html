Good vs Bad Leaders, the magic of texting, and maybe AI isn't coming for you.

“It is true that integrity alone won't make you a leader, but without integrity you will never be one.” — Zig Ziglar

Ready, Set, Action!🎬

<h2>Acting Like A Leader</h2>
When we say “leader,” what's the first thing that comes to your mind? 
A corner office? 
A six-figure salary? 
A seat at the head of a long table?

Sure. 
But may we humbly offer some other images to put into the repertoire?

Coming in early. 
Staying late. 
Listening to everyone. 
Taking feedback. 
Knowing everyone's name.

When Jennifer Tejada talks about what being a CEO means to her, she brings up the memory of her father. 
He ran a hospital, and she remembers how he treated his employees.

“It was funny because, for a long time, I didn't actually know he was the boss because he didn't act like one. 
We'd walk into the hospital and we'd say hi to everybody we bumped into, the janitor or a nurse or the chief of the medical staff or someone working in the cafeteria, and it was always the same. 
It was the same sort of warm greeting. 
He knew everybody by name. 
He knew something about their family or their kids.”
Movies and TV shows are quick to show leaders as powerful and ruthless. 
But if your influence is directly tied to fear and submission, you live on top of a weak cliff that is one earthquake away from sliding into the river below. 
🌊

Kindness, thoughtfulness, and mutual respect breed loyalty. 
And that loyalty pushes people to work harder, work together, and perform better; more so than ruthlessness ever will.

So, if you're heading out today with a goal to work your way to the top, we hope you'll reflect on Jennifer's definition of a boss, and remember that leadership is about the team, not the individual. 
It's about having the confidence to lead the charge forward and the empathy to genuinely care about those that you bring with you on the mission.

You can be powerful and still serve others. 
You can be cutthroat on paper and kind to everyone.

In the words of John C. 
Maxwell, “A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.” A leader is not the one who sees the way, points out the way, and tells others to go that way.

Want further clarification? 
Here's a quick break down:

<h2>👿 A bad leader…</h2>
 — Takes credit.
 — Depends on authority.
 — Uses people.
 — Inspires fear.
 — Hounds employees.
 — Follows a rigid rulebook.

<h2>😇 A good leader…</h2>
 — Gives credit.
 — Depends on goodwill.
 — Develops people.
 — Generates enthusiasm.
 — Coaches employees.
 — Empowers and enables creativity.

PS- Sometimes working under a bad leader (aka, an anti-model) is the best way to develop your own leadership skills. 
Being able to see what doesn't work is the best way to find out what will work instead!
