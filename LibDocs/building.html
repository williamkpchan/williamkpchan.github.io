'<h2>Why are roads on mountains curved instead of being straight?</h2><br>When I studied road construction at University, many many years ago, the professor told us this story:<br><br>In the old times, when a road had to be built up a hill, the team of prospector would lead a donkey or a mule up the incline. <br>The donkey would not go straight up along the shortest route, but would instinctively follow a path with a moderate incline, or grade, very similar to the maximum grade considered safe for roads (8 to 10%).<br><br>The prospectors would hammer stakes in the ground after the donkey and then measure the position of the stakes, draw all the points on a map and start drawing the road profile after joining the dots.<br><br>When the prospectors felt that the donkey had gone too far from the desired direction, or when an obstacle was met, they would turn the donkey around and it would continue climbing in the opposite direction with the same incline. <br>The point where the donkey changed direction would be the location of a hairpin turn.<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-291511570aa85fe73ee09dfaceaf2c30-c"><br>A powerful car with adequate gear ratios (and adequate grip) can go up a very steep incline but a loaded freight vehicle or a bus full of passengers cannot. <br>As many have pointed out in their answers, going downhill on a very steep incline can be extremely dangerous.<br><br>An incline, or grade of 8% is considered the limit for a major road. <br>For short distances, 10% 15% and even 20% grades can be considered acceptable on minor roads, but must be accompanied by adequate signage.<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f49ed0a6e48a4309e22b149057d048bd-c"><br>Some very exceptional grades exist on some mountain roads, but I would not want to travel with a truck on such a road:<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4095b1f3c5c481fb8574e03d860bfe1b"><br>EDIT: Note that “grade” and “angle” of a slope are two different measures since “grade” indicates how much one climbs given a certain distance travelled in horizontal. <br>A grade of 10% corresponds to an angle of about 6° and a grade of 50% corresponds to an angle of 27°. <br>A slope with an angle of 45° would have a grade of 100%<br><br>Those who are keen on trigonometry, or who have recollections of it from school, will recognize that the “grade” is equivalent to the “tangent” of an angle, apart from the unit, which for the trigonometrical tangent is a pure number, while grades are expressed in percent (%) or per-thousand (used in railway engineering, where grades are very small and would result in decimal figures if expressed as percent)<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4289eb8fd7316dad2be225b0060b7999"><br>',
