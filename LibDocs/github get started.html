<h2><span class="orange">Hello World</span></h2>
Follow this Hello World exercise to get started with GitHub.

<h2>&emsp;Introduction</h2>
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
In this quickstart guide, you will:

Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Open and merge a pull request

To complete this tutorial, you need a <a href="http://github.com">GitHub account</a> and Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on). If you have a question about any of the expressions used in this guide, head on over to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary">glossary</a> to find out more about our terminology.
<h2>&emsp;Creating a repository</h2>
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a <em>README</em> file, a file with information about your project. <em>README</em> files are written in the plain text Markdown language. You can use this <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">cheat sheet</a> to get started with Markdown syntax. GitHub lets you add a <em>README</em> file at the same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them now.
Your <code>hello-world</code> repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select <k>New repository</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-11427/images/help/repository/repo-create.png">

In the <k>Repository name</k> box, enter <code>hello-world</code>.

In the <k>Description</k> box, write a short description.

Select <k>Add a README file</k>.

Select whether your repository will be <k>Public</k> or <k>Private</k>.

Click <k>Create repository</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-106613/images/help/repository/hello-world-repo.png">

<h2>&emsp;Creating a branch</h2>
Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
By default, your repository has one branch named <code>main</code> that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of <code>main</code> in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to <code>main</code>.
When you create a branch off the <code>main</code> branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of <code>main</code> as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the <code>main</code> branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
This diagram shows:

The <code>main</code> branch
A new branch called <code>feature</code>

The journey that <code>feature</code> takes before it's merged into <code>main</code>

<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23923/images/help/repository/branching.png">
Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

<code>story.txt</code>
<code>story-edit.txt</code>
<code>story-edit-reviewed.txt</code>

Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our <code>main</code> (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into <code>main</code>.
<h3>Create a branch</h3>

Click the <k>Code</k> tab of your <code>hello-world</code> repository.

Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says <k>main</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-78797/images/help/branches/branch-selection-dropdown.png" alt='Screenshot of the repository page. A dropdown menu, labeled with a branch icon and "main", is highlighted with an orange outline.'>

Type a branch name, <code>readme-edits</code>, into the text box.

Click <k>Create branch: readme-edits from main</k>.

<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-27383/images/help/repository/new-branch.png">
Now you have two branches, <code>main</code> and <code>readme-edits</code>. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch.
<h2>&emsp;Making and committing changes</h2>
When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new <code>readme-edits</code> branch, which is a copy of <code>main</code>.
You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Under the <code>readme-edits</code> branch you created, click the <em>README.md</em> file.

Click  to edit the file.

In the editor, write a bit about yourself. Try using different Markdown elements.

In the <k>Commit changes</k> box, write a commit message that describes your changes.

Click <k>Commit changes</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-75044/images/help/repository/first-commit.png">

These changes will be made only to the README file on your <code>readme-edits</code> branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from <code>main</code>.
<h2>&emsp;Opening a pull request</h2>
Now that you have changes in a branch off of <code>main</code>, you can open a pull request.
Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
By using GitHub's <code>@mention</code> feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time zones away.
You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.

Click the <k>Pull requests</k> tab of your <code>hello-world</code> repository.

Click <k>New pull request</k>

In the <k>Example Comparisons</k> box, select the branch you made, <code>readme-edits</code>, to compare with <code>main</code> (the original).

Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-32937/images/help/repository/diffs.png">

Click <k>Create pull request</k>.

Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.

Optionally, to the right of your title and description, click the  next to <k>Reviewers</k>. <k>Assignees</k>, <k>Labels</k>, <k>Projects</k>, or <k>Milestone</k> to add any of these options to your pull request. You do not need to add any yet, but these options offer different ways to collaborate using pull requests. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>."

Click <k>Create pull request</k>.

Your collaborators can now review your edits and make suggestions.
<h2>&emsp;Merging your pull request</h2>
In this final step, you will merge your <code>readme-edits</code> branch into the <code>main</code> branch.  After you merge your pull request, the changes on your <code>readme-edits</code> branch will be incorporated into <code>main</code>.
Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on <code>main</code>. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.
In this walk-through, you should not have any conflicts, so you are ready to merge your branch into the main branch.

Click <k>Merge pull request</k> to merge the changes into <code>main</code>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-13037/images/help/pull_requests/pullrequest-mergebutton.png">

Click <k>Confirm merge</k>. You will receive a message that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.
Click <k>Delete branch</k>. Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on <code>main</code>, you can safely delete the <code>readme-edits</code> branch. If you want to make more changes to your project, you can always create a new branch and repeat this process.

<h2>&emsp;Next steps</h2>
By completing this tutorial, you've learned to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub.
Here's what you accomplished in this tutorial:

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a pull request

Take a look at your GitHub profile and you'll see your work reflected on your contribution graph.
For more information about the power of branches and pull requests, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow">GitHub flow</a>." For more information about getting started with GitHub, see the other guides in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart">getting started quickstart</a>.

<h2><span class="orange">Set up Git</span></h2>

At the heart of GitHub is an open-source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.

<h2>&emsp;Using Git</h2>
To use Git on the command line, you will need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer. You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub from the command line. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli">About GitHub CLI</a>."
If you want to work with Git locally, but do not want to use the command line, you can download and install the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> client.  For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop">Installing and configuring GitHub Desktop</a>."
If you do not need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:

Creating a repository
Forking a repository
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files">Managing files</a>
Being social

<h2>&emsp;Setting up Git</h2>

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download and install the latest version of Git</a>.

<k>Note</k>: If you are using a Chrome OS device, additional setup is required:

Install a terminal emulator such as Termux from the Google Play Store on your Chrome OS device.
From the terminal emulator that you installed, install Git. For example, in Termux, enter <code>apt install git</code> and then type <code>y</code> when prompted. 

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git">Set your username in Git</a>.

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address">Set your commit email address in Git</a>.

<h2>&emsp;Authenticating with GitHub from Git</h2>
When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you will need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.

<k>Note:</k> You can authenticate to GitHub using GitHub CLI, for either HTTP or SSH. For more information, see <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login"><code>gh auth login</code></a>.

<h3>Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)</h3>
If you clone with HTTPS, you can cache your GitHub credentials in Git using a credential helper. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls">About remote repositories</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git">Caching your GitHub credentials in Git</a>."
<h3>Connecting over SSH</h3>
If you clone with SSH, you must generate SSH keys on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-ssh-urls">About remote repositories</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Next steps</h2>
You now have Git and GitHub all set up. You may now choose to create a repository where you can put your projects. Saving your code in a repository allows you to back up your code and share it around the world. 

Creating a repository for your project allows you to store code in GitHub. This provides a backup of your work that you can choose to share with other developers. For more information, see “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">Create a repository</a>.".

Forking a repository will allow you to make changes to another repository without affecting the original. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">Fork a repo</a>."

Each repository on GitHub is owned by a person or an organization. You can interact with the people, repositories, and organizations by connecting and following them on GitHub. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/be-social">Be social</a>."

GitHub has a great support community where you can ask for help and talk to people from around the world. Join the conversation on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions">GitHub Community</a>.

<h2><span class="orange">Create a repo</span></h2>

To put your project up on GitHub, you will need to create a repository for it to live in.

<h2>&emsp;Create a repository</h2>
You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories">About repositories</a>." To learn more about open source projects, visit <a href="https://opensource.org/about">OpenSource.org</a>.

<k>Notes:</k> 

You can create public repositories for an open source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">license file</a> that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created <a href="https://opensource.guide/">Open Source Guides</a> that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. 
You can also take a free <a href="https://skills.github.com/">GitHub Skills</a> course on maintaining open source communities. 
You can also add community health files to your repositories, to set guidelines on how to contribute, keep your repositories safe, and much more. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file">Creating a default community health file</a>." 

In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select <k>New repository</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-11427/images/help/repository/repo-create.png">

Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-25139/images/help/repository/create-repository-name.png">

Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-26377/images/help/repository/create-repository-desc.png">

Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility">About repositories</a>."
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-20877/images/help/repository/create-repository-public-private.png">

Select <k>Initialize this repository with a README</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-49938/images/help/repository/initialize-with-readme.png">

Click <k>Create repository</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19887/images/help/repository/create-repository-button.png">

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a <em>README</em> file.

To learn more about GitHub CLI, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli">About GitHub CLI</a>."

In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to create a local clone of your new project.
To create a repository for your project, use the <code>gh repo create</code> subcommand. When prompted, select <k>Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch</k> and enter the name of your new project. If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of to your personal account, specify the organization name and project name with <code>organization-name/project-name</code>. 
Follow the interactive prompts. To clone the repository locally, confirm yes when asked if you would like to clone the remote project directory.  
Alternatively, to skip the prompts supply the repository name and a visibility flag (<code>--public</code>, <code>--private</code>, or <code>--internal</code>). For example, <code>gh repo create project-name --public</code>. To clone the repository locally, pass the <code>--clone</code> flag.  For more information about possible arguments, see the <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create">GitHub CLI manual</a>.

<h2>&emsp;Commit your first change</h2>

A <em><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#commit">commit</a></em> is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.
When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a <em>README</em> file. <em>README</em> files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your <em>README</em> file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
Let's commit a change to the <em>README</em> file.

In your repository's list of files, click <k><em>README.md</em></k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-44661/images/help/repository/create-commit-open-readme.png">

Above the file's content, click .
On the <k>Edit file</k> tab, type some information about yourself.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-15835/images/help/repository/edit-readme-light.png">

Above the new content, click <k>Preview changes</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23166/images/help/repository/edit-readme-preview-changes.png">

Review the changes you made to the file. You will see the new content in green.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33561/images/help/repository/create-commit-review.png">

At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors">Creating a commit with multiple authors</a>."
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-9378/images/help/repository/write-commit-message-quick-pull.png">

Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">Creating a pull request</a>."
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-32137/images/help/repository/choose-commit-branch.png">

Click <k>Propose file change</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-13681/images/help/repository/propose-file-change-quick-pull.png">

Now that you have created a project, you can start committing changes.
<em>README</em> files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your <em>README</em> file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository. Follow these steps to add a <em>README</em> file.

In the command line, navigate to the root directory of your new project. (This directory was created when you ran the <code>gh repo create</code> command.)

Create a <em>README</em> file with some information about the project.
<code>echo "info about this project" &gt;&gt; README.md</code></pre>

Enter <code>git status</code>. You will see that you have an untracked <code>README.md</code> file.
<code>$ git status

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
  README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</file></code></pre>

Stage and commit the file.
<code>git add README.md &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Add README"</code></pre>

Push the changes to your branch.
<code>git push --set-upstream origin HEAD</code></pre>

<h2>&emsp;Next steps</h2>
You have now created a repository, including a <em>README</em> file, and created your first commit on GitHub.com.

You can now clone a GitHub repository to create a local copy on your computer. From your local repository you can commit, and create a pull request to update the changes in the upstream repository. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Cloning a repository</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git">Set up Git</a>."

You can find interesting projects and repositories on GitHub and make changes to them by creating a fork of the repository. Forking a repository will allow you to make changes to another repository without affecting the original. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">Fork a repo</a>."

Each repository on GitHub is owned by a person or an organization. You can interact with the people, repositories, and organizations by connecting and following them on GitHub. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/be-social">Be social</a>."

<h2><span class="orange">Fork a repo</span></h2>

A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository.

<h2>&emsp;About forks</h2>
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.  For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks">Working with forks</a>."
<h3>Propose changes to someone else's project</h3>
For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.

<h3>Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</h3>
Open source software is based on the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software. For more information, see the "<a href="https://opensource.org/about">About the Open Source Initiative</a>" on the Open Source Initiative.
For more information about applying open source principles to your organization's development work on GitHub.com, see GitHub's white paper "<a href="https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/">An introduction to innersource</a>."
When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information, see "<a href="https://choosealicense.com/">Choose an open source license</a>" at choosealicense.com.
For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created <a href="https://opensource.guide/">Open Source Guides</a> that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free <a href="https://skills.github.com/">GitHub Skills</a> course on maintaining open source communities.
<h2>&emsp;Prerequisites</h2>
If you haven't yet, first set up Git and authentication with GitHub.com from Git. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git">Set up Git</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Forking a repository</h2>

You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife">octocat/Spoon-Knife</a> repository you just forked.

On GitHub.com, navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife">octocat/Spoon-Knife</a> repository.
In the top-right corner of the page, click <k>Fork</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23088/images/help/repository/fork_button.png">

Select an owner for the forked repository.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-151543/images/help/repository/fork-choose-owner.png">

By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-151542/images/help/repository/fork-choose-repo-name.png">

Optionally, add a description of your fork.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-177452/images/help/repository/fork-description.png">

Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.

<h2><span class="orange">GitHub flow</span></h2>

Follow GitHub flow to collaborate on projects.

<h2>&emsp;Introduction</h2>
GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful for everyone, not just developers. For example, here at GitHub, we use GitHub flow for our <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy">site policy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github/docs">documentation</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap">roadmap</a>.
<h2>&emsp;Prerequisites</h2>
To follow GitHub flow, you will need a GitHub account and a repository. For information on how to create an account, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github">Signing up for GitHub</a>." For information on how to create a repository, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">Create a repo</a>." For information on how to find an existing repository to contribute to, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github">Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Following GitHub flow</h2>

<k>Tip:</k> You can complete all steps of GitHub flow through GitHub web interface, command line and <a href="https://cli.github.com">GitHub CLI</a>, or <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop">GitHub Desktop</a>.

<h3>Create a branch</h3>
  Create a branch in your repository. A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, <code>increase-test-timeout</code> or <code>add-code-of-conduct</code>. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository">Creating and deleting branches within your repository</a>."
  By creating a branch, you create a space to work without affecting the default branch. Additionally, you give collaborators a chance to review your work.
<h3>Make changes</h3>
On your branch, make any desired changes to the repository. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files">Creating new files</a>", "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files">Editing files</a>", "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/renaming-a-file">Renaming a file</a>", "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location">Moving a file to a new location</a>", or "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/deleting-files-in-a-repository">Deleting files in a repository</a>".
Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the mistake. Your changes will not end up on the default branch until you merge your branch.
Commit and push your changes to your branch. Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains. For example, <code>fix typo</code> or <code>increase rate limit</code>.
Ideally, each commit contains an isolated, complete change. This makes it easy to revert your changes if you decide to take a different approach. For example, if you want to rename a variable and add some tests, put the variable rename in one commit and the tests in another commit. Later, if you want to keep the tests but revert the variable rename, you can revert the specific commit that contained the variable rename. If you put the variable rename and tests in the same commit or spread the variable rename across multiple commits, you would spend more effort reverting your changes.
By committing and pushing your changes, you back up your work to remote storage. This means that you can access your work from any device. It also means that your collaborators can see your work, answer questions, and make suggestions or contributions.
Continue to make, commit, and push changes to your branch until you are ready to ask for feedback.

<k>Tip:</k> Make a separate branch for each set of unrelated changes. This makes it easier for reviewers to give feedback. It also makes it easier for you and future collaborators to understand the changes and to revert or build on them. Additionally, if there is a delay in one set of changes, your other changes aren't also delayed.

<h3>Create a pull request</h3>
Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes. Pull request review is so valuable that some repositories require an approving review before pull requests can be merged. If you want early feedback or advice before you complete your changes, you can mark your pull request as a draft. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">Creating a pull request</a>."
When you create a pull request, include a summary of the changes and what problem they solve. You can include images, links, and tables to help convey this information. If your pull request addresses an issue, link the issue so that issue stakeholders are aware of the pull request and vice versa. If you link with a keyword, the issue will close automatically when the pull request merges. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">Basic writing and formatting syntax</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue">Linking a pull request to an issue</a>."
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-155985/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-body.png">
In addition to filling out the body of the pull request, you can add comments to specific lines of the pull request to explicitly point something out to the reviewers.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-37772/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-comment.png">
Your repository may be configured to automatically request a review from specific teams or users when a pull request is created. You can also manually @mention or request a review from specific people or teams.
If your repository has checks configured to run on pull requests, you will see any checks that failed on your pull request. This helps you catch errors before merging your branch. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks">About status checks</a>."
<h3>Address review comments</h3>
Reviewers should leave questions, comments, and suggestions. Reviewers can comment on the whole pull request or add comments to specific lines. You and reviewers can insert images or code suggestions to clarify comments. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests">Reviewing changes in pull requests</a>."
You can continue to commit and push changes in response to the reviews. Your pull request will update automatically.
<h3>Merge your pull request</h3>
Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on the default branch. GitHub retains the history of comments and commits in the pull request to help future contributors understand your changes. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request">Merging a pull request</a>."
GitHub will tell you if your pull request has conflicts that must be resolved before merging. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts">Addressing merge conflicts</a>."
Branch protection settings may block merging if your pull request does not meet certain requirements. For example, you need a certain number of approving reviews or an approving review from a specific team. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches">About protected branches</a>."
<h3>Delete your branch</h3>
After you merge your pull request, delete your branch. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/deleting-and-restoring-branches-in-a-pull-request">Deleting and restoring branches in a pull request</a>."
Don't worry about losing information. Your pull request and commit history will not be deleted. You can always restore your deleted branch or revert your pull request if needed.

<h2><span class="orange">Contributing to projects</span></h2>

Learn how to contribute to a project through forking.

<h2>&emsp;About forking</h2>
If you want to contribute to someone else's project but don't have write access to the repository, you can use a "fork and pull request" workflow. 
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.
You can contribute by submitting pull requests from your fork to the upstream repository. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">Fork a repo</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Forking a repository</h2>
This tutorial uses <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife">the Spoon-Knife project</a>, a test repository that's hosted on GitHub.com that lets you test the fork and pull request workflow.

Navigate to the <code>Spoon-Knife</code> project at <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife">https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife</a>.
Click <k>Fork</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23088/images/help/repository/fork_button.png">

Select an owner for the forked repository.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-151543/images/help/repository/fork-choose-owner.png">

By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-151542/images/help/repository/fork-choose-repo-name.png">

Optionally, add a description of your fork.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-177452/images/help/repository/fork-description.png">

Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59189/images/help/repository/copy-default-branch-only.png">

Click <k>Create fork</k>.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-49879/images/help/repository/fork-create-button.png">

<k>Note:</k> If you want to copy additional branches from the upstream repository, you can do so from the <k>Branches</k> page.

<h2>&emsp;Creating a branch to work on</h2>
Before making changes to the project, you should create a new branch and check it out. By keeping changes in their own branch, you follow GitHub Flow and ensure that it will be easier to contribute to the same project again in the future. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#following-github-flow">GitHub flow</a>."

<code>git branch BRANCH-NAME
git checkout BRANCH-NAME</code></pre>

<code>git branch BRANCH-NAME
git checkout BRANCH-NAME</code></pre>

For more information about how to create and manage branches in GitHub Desktop, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches">Managing branches</a>."

<h2>&emsp;Making and pushing changes</h2>
Go ahead and make a few changes to the project using your favorite text editor, like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>. You could, for example, change the text in <code>index.html</code> to add your GitHub username.
When you're ready to submit your changes, stage and commit your changes. <code>git add .</code> tells Git that you want to include all of your changes in the next commit. <code>git commit</code> takes a snapshot of those changes.

<code>git add .
git commit -m "a short description of the change"</code></pre>

<code>git add .
git commit -m "a short description of the change"</code></pre>

For more information about how to stage and commit changes in GitHub Desktop, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#selecting-changes-to-include-in-a-commit">Committing and reviewing changes to your project</a>."

When you stage and commit files, you essentially tell Git, "Okay, take a snapshot of my changes!" You can continue to make more changes, and take more commit snapshots.
Right now, your changes only exist locally. When you're ready to push your changes up to GitHub, push your changes to the remote.

<code>git push</code></pre>

<code>git push</code></pre>

For more information about how to push changes in GitHub Desktop, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github">Pushing changes to GitHub</a>."

<h2>&emsp;Making a pull request</h2>
At last, you're ready to propose changes into the main project! This is the final step in producing a fork of someone else's project, and arguably the most important. If you've made a change that you feel would benefit the community as a whole, you should definitely consider contributing back.
To do so, head on over to the repository on GitHub where your project lives. For this example, it would be at <code>https://github.com/&lt;your_username&gt;/Spoon-Knife</code>. You'll see a banner indicating that your branch is one commit ahead of <code>octocat:main</code>. Click <k>Contribute</k> and then <k>Open a pull request</k>.
GitHub will bring you to a page that shows the differences between your fork and the <code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code> repository. Click <k>Create pull request</k>.
GitHub will bring you to a page where you can enter a title and a description of your changes. It's important to provide as much useful information and a rationale for why you're making this pull request in the first place. The project owner needs to be able to determine whether your change is as useful to everyone as you think it is. Finally, click <k>Create pull request</k>.
<h2>&emsp;Managing feedback</h2>
Pull Requests are an area for discussion. In this case, the Octocat is very busy, and probably won't merge your changes. For other projects, don't be offended if the project owner rejects your pull request, or asks for more information on why it's been made. It may even be that the project owner chooses not to merge your pull request, and that's totally okay. Your changes exist in your fork. And who knows--maybe someone you've never met will find your changes much more valuable than the original project.
<h2>&emsp;Finding projects</h2>
You've successfully forked and contributed back to a repository. Go forth, and
contribute some more! For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github">Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub</a>."

GitHub has a great support community where you can ask for help and talk to people from around the world. Join the conversation on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions">GitHub Community</a>.

<h2><span class="orange">Communicating on GitHub</span></h2>

You can discuss specific projects and changes, as well as broader ideas or team goals, using different types of discussions on GitHub.

<h2>&emsp;Introduction</h2>
GitHub provides built-in collaborative communication tools allowing you to interact closely with your community. This quickstart guide will show you how to pick the right tool for your needs.
You can create and participate in issues, pull requests, GitHub Discussions, and team discussions, depending on the type of conversation you'd like to have.
<h3>GitHub Issues</h3>

are useful for discussing specific details of a project such as bug reports, planned improvements and feedback.
are specific to a repository, and usually have a clear owner.
are often referred to as GitHub's bug-tracking system.

<h3>Pull requests</h3>

allow you to propose specific changes.
allow you to comment directly on proposed changes suggested by others.
are specific to a repository.

<h3>GitHub Discussions</h3>

are like a forum, and are best used for open-form ideas and discussions where collaboration is important.
may span many repositories.
provide a collaborative experience outside the codebase, allowing the brainstorming of ideas, and the creation of a community knowledge base.
often don’t have a clear owner.
often do not result in an actionable task.

<h3>Team discussions</h3>

can be started on your team's page for conversations that span across projects and don't belong in a specific issue or pull request. Instead of opening an issue in a repository to discuss an idea, you can include the entire team by having a conversation in a team discussion.
allow you to hold discussions with your team about planning, analysis, design, user research and general project decision making in one place.

<h2>&emsp;Which discussion tool should I use?</h2>
<h3>Scenarios for issues</h3>

I want to keep track of tasks, enhancements and bugs.
I want to file a bug report.
I want to share feedback about a specific feature.
I want to ask a question about files in the repository.

<h4>
Issue example</h4>
This example illustrates how a GitHub user created an issue in our documentation open source repository to make us aware of a bug, and discuss a fix.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-93016/images/help/issues/issue-example.png">

A user noticed that the blue color of the banner at the top of the page in the Chinese version of the GitHub Docs makes the text in the banner unreadable.
The user created an issue in the repository, stating the problem and suggesting a fix (which is, use a different background color for the banner).
A discussion ensues, and eventually, a consensus will be reached about the fix to apply.
A contributor can then create a pull request with the fix.

<h3>Scenarios for pull requests</h3>

I want to fix a typo in a repository.
I want to make changes to a repository.
I want to make changes to fix an issue.
I want to comment on changes suggested by others.

<h4>
Pull request example</h4>
This example illustrates how a GitHub user created a pull request in our documentation open source repository to fix a typo.
In the <k>Conversation</k> tab of the pull request, the author explains why they created the pull request.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-56735/images/help/pull_requests/pr-conversation-example.png">
The <k>Files changed</k> tab of the pull request shows the implemented fix.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-43403/images/help/pull_requests/pr-files-changed-example.png">

This contributor notices a typo in the repository.
The user creates a pull request with the fix.
A repository maintainer reviews the pull request, comments on it, and merges it.

<h3>Scenarios for GitHub Discussions</h3>

I have a question that's not necessarily related to specific files in the repository.
I want to share news with my collaborators, or my team.
I want to start or participate in an open-ended conversation.
I want to make an announcement to my community.

<h4>
GitHub Discussions example</h4>
This example shows the GitHub Discussions welcome post for the GitHub Docs open source repository, and illustrates how the team wants to collaborate with their community.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-351307/images/help/discussions/github-discussions-example.png" alt='Screenshot of an example of a discussion, with the title "Welcome to GitHub Docs Discussions."'>
This community maintainer started a discussion to welcome the community, and to ask members to introduce themselves. This post fosters an inviting atmosphere for visitors and contributors. The post also clarifies that the team's happy to help with contributions to the repository.
<h3>Scenarios for team discussions</h3>

I have a question that's not necessarily related to specific files in the repository.
I want to share news with my collaborators, or my team.
I want to start or participate in an open-ended conversation.
I want to make an announcement to my team.

As you can see, team discussions are very similar to GitHub Discussions. For GitHub.com, we recommend using GitHub Discussions as the starting point for conversations. You can use GitHub Discussions to collaborate with any community on GitHub. If you are part of an organization, and would like to initiate conversations within your organization or team within that organization, you should use team discussions.
<h4>
Team discussion example</h4>
This example shows a team post for the <code>octo-team</code> team.
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-228574/images/help/projects/team-discussions-example.png">
The <code>octocat</code> team member posted a team discussion, informing the team of various things:

A team member called Mona started remote game events.
There is a blog post describing how the teams use GitHub Actions to produce their docs.
Material about the April All Hands is now available for all team members to view.

<h2>&emsp;Next steps</h2>
These examples showed you how to decide which is the best tool for your conversations on GitHub. But this is only the beginning; there is so much more you can do to tailor these tools to your needs.
For issues, for example, you can tag issues with labels for quicker searching and create issue templates to help contributors open meaningful issues. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues#working-with-issues">About issues</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates">About issue and pull request templates</a>."
For pull requests, you can create draft pull requests if your proposed changes are still a work in progress. Draft pull requests cannot be merged until they're marked as ready for review. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>."
For GitHub Discussions, you can set up a code of conduct and pin discussions that contain important information for your community. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions">About discussions</a>."
For team discussions, you can edit or delete discussions on a team's page, and you can configure notifications for team discussions. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions">About team discussions</a>."

  A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.
<h2>&emsp;commit</h2>
  A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

<h2>&emsp;push a branch</h2>
  When you successfully push a branch to a remote repository, you update the remote branch with changes from your local branch. When you "push a branch", Git will search for the branch's HEAD ref in the remote repository and verify that it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local HEAD ref. Once verified, Git pulls all objects (reachable from the local HEAD ref and missing from the remote repository) into the remote object database and then updates the remote HEAD ref.

<h2>&emsp;transfer</h2>
  To transfer a repository means to change the owner of a repository. The new owner will be able to immediately administer the repository's contents, issues, pull requests, releases, and settings.
<h2>&emsp;upstream</h2>
  When talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the "upstream", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the "downstream". Also called origin.
<h2>&emsp;upstream branch</h2>
  The default branch that is merged into the branch in question (or the branch in question is rebased onto). It is configured via <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code> and <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code>. If the upstream branch of A is origin/B sometimes we say "A is tracking origin/B".

The scope of tasks an application can perform using a user-to-server request is restricted by both the app's and the user's permissions and access. The token used in a user-to-server request is acquired via OAuth. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps">Identifying and authorizing users for GitHub Apps</a>."

<h2><span class="orange">Setting your username in Git</span></h2>

Git uses a username to associate commits with an identity. The Git username is not the same as your GitHub username.

<h2>&emsp;About Git usernames</h2>
You can change the name that is associated with your Git commits using the <code>git config</code> command. The new name you set will be visible in any future commits you push to GitHub from the command line. If you'd like to keep your real name private, you can use any text as your Git username.
Changing the name associated with your Git commits using <code>git config</code> will only affect future commits and will not change the name used for past commits.
<h2>&emsp;Setting your Git username for <em>every</em> repository on your computer</h2>

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.

Set a Git username:
<code>$ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"</code>

Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly:
<code>$ git config --global user.name
> Mona Lisa</code>

<h2>&emsp;Setting your Git username for a single repository</h2>

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the name that is associated with your Git commits.

Set a Git username:
<code>$ git config user.name "Mona Lisa"</code>

Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly:
<code>$ git config user.name
> Mona Lisa</code>

<h2><span class="orange">Caching your GitHub credentials in Git</span></h2>

If you're <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-remote-repositories">cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS</a>, we recommend you use GitHub CLI or Git Credential Manager (GCM) to remember your credentials.

<strong>Tip:</strong> If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you  can authenticate using an SSH key instead of using other credentials. For information about setting up an SSH connection, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">Connecting to GitHub with SSH</a>."

<h2>&emsp;GitHub CLI</h2>
GitHub CLI will automatically store your Git credentials for you when you choose <code>HTTPS</code> as your preferred protocol for Git operations and answer "yes" to the prompt asking if you would like to authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials.

<a href="https://github.com/cli/cli#installation">Install</a> GitHub CLI on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
In the command line, enter <code>gh auth login</code>, then follow the prompts.

When prompted for your preferred protocol for Git operations, select <code>HTTPS</code>.
When asked if you would like to authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials, enter <code>Y</code>.

For more information about authenticating with GitHub CLI, see .
<h2>&emsp;Git Credential Manager</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager">Git Credential Manager</a> (GCM) is another way to store your credentials securely and connect to GitHub over HTTPS. With GCM, you don't have to manually <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">create and store a personal access token</a>, as GCM manages authentication on your behalf, including 2FA (two-factor authentication).

Install Git using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:
<code>$ brew install git</code>

Install GCM using Homebrew:
<code>$ brew tap microsoft/git
$ brew install --cask git-credential-manager-core</code>
For MacOS, you don't need to run <code>git config</code> because GCM automatically configures Git for you.

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. If your account or organization requires <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa">two-factor auth</a>, you'll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.
Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the macOS keychain and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.

Install Git for Windows, which includes GCM. For more information, see "<a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest">Git for Windows releases</a>" from its <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest">releases page</a>.

We recommend always installing the latest version. At a minimum, install version 2.29 or higher, which is the first version offering OAuth support for GitHub.
The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. If your account or organization requires <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa">two-factor auth</a>, you'll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.
Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the Windows credential manager and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.
<br>
<strong>Warning:</strong> Older versions of Git for Windows came with Git Credential Manager for Windows. This older product is no longer supported and cannot connect to GitHub via OAuth. We recommend you upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest">the latest version of Git for Windows</a>.

<strong>Warning:</strong> If you cached incorrect or outdated credentials in Credential Manager for Windows, Git will fail to access GitHub. To reset your cached credentials so that Git prompts you to enter your credentials, access the Credential Manager in the Windows Control Panel under User Accounts > Credential Manager. Look for the GitHub entry and delete it. 

For Linux, install Git and GCM, then configure Git to use GCM.

Install Git from your distro's packaging system. Instructions will vary depending on the flavor of Linux you run.

Install GCM. See the <a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager#linux-install-instructions">instructions in the GCM repo</a>, as they'll vary depending on the flavor of Linux you run.

Configure Git to use GCM. There are several backing stores that you may choose from, so see the GCM docs to complete your setup. For more information, see "<a href="https://aka.ms/gcmcore-linuxcredstores">GCM Linux</a>."

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. If your account or organization requires <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa">two-factor auth</a>, you'll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.
Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored on your system and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.
For more options for storing your credentials on Linux, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage">Credential Storage</a> in Pro Git.

<br>For more information or to report issues with GCM, see the official GCM docs at "<a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager">Git Credential Manager</a>."

<h2><span class="orange">Why is Git always asking for my password?</span></h2>

If Git prompts you for a username and password every time you try to interact with GitHub, you're probably using the HTTPS clone URL for your repository.

Using an HTTPS remote URL has some advantages compared with using SSH. It's easier to set up than SSH, and usually works through strict firewalls and proxies. However, it also prompts you to enter your GitHub credentials every time you pull or push a repository. 
When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like <a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md">Git Credential Manager</a>. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">Creating a personal access token</a>."
You can avoid being prompted for your password by configuring Git to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git">cache your credentials</a> for you. Once you've configured credential caching, Git automatically uses your cached personal access token when you pull or push a repository using HTTPS.

<h2><span class="orange">Updating credentials from the macOS Keychain</span></h2>

You'll need to update your saved credentials in the <code>git-credential-osxkeychain</code> helper if you change your username, password, or personal access token on GitHub.

<strong>Note:</strong> Updating credentials from the macOS Keychain only applies to users who manually configured a personal access token using the <code>osxkeychain</code> helper that is built-in to macOS.
We recommend you either <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">configure SSH</a> or upgrade to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git">Git Credential Manager</a> (GCM) instead. GCM can manage authentication on your behalf (no more manual personal access tokens) including 2FA (two-factor auth).

When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like <a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md">Git Credential Manager</a>. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">Creating a personal access token</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Updating your credentials via Keychain Access</h2>

Click on the Spotlight icon (magnifying glass) on the right side of the menu bar.
Type <code>Keychain Access</code>, then press the Enter key to launch the app.
In Keychain Access, search for <code>github.com</code>.
Find the "Internet password" entry for <code>github.com</code>.
Edit or delete the entry accordingly.

<h2>&emsp;Deleting your credentials via the command line</h2>
Through the command line, you can use the credential helper directly to erase the keychain entry.
<code>$ git credential-osxkeychain erase
host=github.com
protocol=https
> [Press Return]</code>
If it's successful, nothing will print out. To test that it works, try and clone a private repository from GitHub.com. If you are prompted for a password, the keychain entry was deleted.

<h2><span class="orange">Git workflows</span></h2>

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects that deploy regularly.
You can adopt the GitHub flow method to standardize how your team functions and collaborates on GitHub. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow">GitHub flow</a>."

<h2><span class="orange">About remote repositories</span></h2>

GitHub's collaborative approach to development depends on publishing commits from your local repository to GitHub for other people to view, fetch, and update.

<h2>&emsp;About remote repositories</h2>
A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.
You can only push to two types of URL addresses:

An HTTPS URL like <code>https://github.com/user/repo.git</code>

An SSH URL, like <code>git@github.com:user/repo.git</code>

Git associates a remote URL with a name, and your default remote is usually called <code>origin</code>.
<h2>&emsp;Creating remote repositories</h2>
You can use the <code>git remote add</code> command to match a remote URL with a name.
For example, you'd type the following in the command line:
<code>git remote add origin &lt;REMOTE_URL></code>
This associates the name <code>origin</code> with the <code>REMOTE_URL</code>.
You can use the command <code>git remote set-url</code> to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories">change a remote's URL</a>.
<h2>&emsp;Choosing a URL for your remote repository</h2>
There are several ways to clone repositories available on GitHub.com.
When you view a repository while signed in to your account, the URLs you can use to clone the project onto your computer are available below the repository details.
For information on setting or changing your remote URL, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories">Managing remote repositories</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Cloning with HTTPS URLs</h2>
The <code>https://</code> clone URLs are available on all repositories, regardless of visibility. <code>https://</code> clone URLs work even if you are behind a firewall or proxy.
When you <code>git clone</code>, <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, or <code>git push</code> to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like <a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md">Git Credential Manager</a>. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">Creating a personal access token</a>."
If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML SSO and you are using a personal access token (classic), you must also authorize your personal access token to access the organization before you authenticate. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on">About authentication with SAML single sign-on</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on">Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on</a>."

<strong>Tips</strong>:

You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub credentials every time it talks to GitHub. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git">Caching your GitHub credentials in Git</a>."
To clone a repository without authenticating to GitHub on the command line, you can use GitHub Desktop to clone instead. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop">Cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop</a>."

 If you'd rather use SSH but cannot connect over port 22, you might be able to use SSH over the HTTPS port. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port">Using SSH over the HTTPS port</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Cloning with SSH URLs</h2>
SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. To use these URLs, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the <strong>public</strong> key to your account on GitHub.com. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">Connecting to GitHub with SSH</a>."
When you <code>git clone</code>, <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, or <code>git push</code> to a remote repository using SSH URLs, you'll be prompted for a password and must provide your SSH key passphrase. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases">Working with SSH key passphrases</a>."
If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), you must authorize your SSH key to access the organization before you authenticate. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on">About authentication with SAML single sign-on</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on">Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on</a>" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

<strong>Tip</strong>: You can use an SSH URL to clone a repository to your computer, or as a secure way of deploying your code to production servers. You can also use SSH agent forwarding with your deploy script to avoid managing keys on the server. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/using-ssh-agent-forwarding">Using SSH agent forwarding</a>."

<h2>&emsp;Cloning with GitHub CLI</h2>
You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub workflows in your terminal. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli">About GitHub CLI</a>."
<h2>&emsp;Cloning with Subversion</h2>

<strong>Note</strong>: Subversion support will be removed from GitHub
on January 8, 2024. A future release of GitHub Enterprise Server after January 8, 2024
will also remove Subversion support. To read more about this, see <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-20-sunsetting-subversion-support/">the GitHub blog</a>.

You can also use a <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> client to access any repository on GitHub. Subversion offers a different feature set than Git. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/working-with-subversion-on-github/what-are-the-differences-between-subversion-and-git">What are the differences between Subversion and Git?</a>"
You can also access repositories on GitHub from Subversion clients. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/working-with-subversion-on-github/support-for-subversion-clients">Support for Subversion clients</a>."

<h2><span class="orange">Managing remote repositories</span></h2>

Learn to work with your local repositories on your computer and remote repositories hosted on GitHub.

<h2>&emsp;Adding a remote repository</h2>
To add a new remote, use the <code>git remote add</code> command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
The <code>git remote add</code> command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, <code>origin</code>

A remote URL, for example, <code>https://github.com/user/repo.git</code>

For example:
<code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/USER/REPO.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USER/REPO.git (push)</code>
For more information on which URL to use, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories">About remote repositories</a>."
<h3>
Troubleshooting: Remote origin already exists</h3>
This error means you've tried to add a remote with a name that already exists in your local repository.
<code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
> fatal: remote origin already exists.</code>
To fix this, you can:

Use a different name for the new remote.
Rename the existing remote repository before you add the new remote. For more information, see "<a href="#renaming-a-remote-repository">Renaming a remote repository</a>" below.
Delete the existing remote repository before you add the new remote. For more information, see "<a href="#removing-a-remote-repository">Removing a remote repository</a>" below.

<h2>&emsp;Changing a remote repository's URL</h2>
The <code>git remote set-url</code> command changes an existing remote repository URL.

<strong>Tip:</strong> For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories">About remote repositories</a>."

The <code>git remote set-url</code> command takes two arguments:

An existing remote name. For example, <code>origin</code> or <code>upstream</code> are two common choices.
A new URL for the remote. For example:

If you're updating to use HTTPS, your URL might look like:
<code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</code>

If you're updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:
<code>git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</code>

<h3>
Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS</h3>

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.
Change the current working directory to your local project.
List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.
<code>$ git remote -v
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>

Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the <code>git remote set-url</code> command.
<code>$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</code>

Verify that the remote URL has changed.
<code>$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>

The next time you <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, or <code>git push</code> to the remote repository, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like <a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md">Git Credential Manager</a>. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">Creating a personal access token</a>."
You can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git">use a credential helper</a> so Git will remember your GitHub username and personal access token every time it talks to GitHub.
<h3>
Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH</h3>

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.
Change the current working directory to your local project.
List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.
<code>$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>

Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the <code>git remote set-url</code> command.
<code>$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</code>

Verify that the remote URL has changed.
<code>$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  git@github.com: USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com: USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>

<h3>
Troubleshooting: No such remote '[name]'</h3>
This error means that the remote you tried to change doesn't exist:
<code>$ git remote set-url sofake https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
> fatal: No such remote 'sofake'</code>
Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.
<h2>&emsp;Renaming a remote repository</h2>
Use the <code>git remote rename</code> command to rename an existing remote.
The <code>git remote rename</code> command takes two arguments:

An existing remote name, for example, <code>origin</code>

A new name for the remote, for example, <code>destination</code>

<h3>
Example of renaming a remote repository</h3>
These examples assume you're <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls">cloning using HTTPS</a>, which is recommended.
<code>$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rename origin destination
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'destination'

$ git remote -v
# Verify remote's new name
> destination  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>
<h3>
Troubleshooting: Could not rename config section 'remote.[old name]' to 'remote.[new name]'</h3>
This error means that the old remote name you typed doesn't exist.
You can check which remotes currently exist with the <code>git remote -v</code> command:
<code>$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>
<h3>
Troubleshooting: Remote [new name] already exists</h3>
This error means that the remote name you want to use already exists. To solve this, either use a different remote name, or rename the original remote.
<h2>&emsp;Removing a remote repository</h2>
Use the <code>git remote rm</code> command to remove a remote URL from your repository.
The <code>git remote rm</code> command takes one argument:

A remote name, for example, <code>destination</code>

Removing the remote URL from your repository only unlinks the local and remote repositories. It does not delete the remote repository.
<h3>
Example of removing a remote repository</h3>
These examples assume you're <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls">cloning using HTTPS</a>, which is recommended.
<code>$ git remote -v
# View current remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rm destination
# Remove remote
$ git remote -v
# Verify it's gone
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)</code>

<strong>Note</strong>: <code>git remote rm</code> does not delete the remote repository from the server. It simply
removes the remote and its references from your local repository.

<h3>
Troubleshooting: Could not remove config section 'remote.[name]'</h3>
This error means that the remote you tried to delete doesn't exist:
<code>$ git remote rm sofake
> error: Could not remove config section 'remote.sofake'</code>
Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.

<h2><span class="orange">Configuring Git to handle line endings</span></h2>

To avoid problems in your diffs, you can configure Git to properly handle line endings.

<h2>&emsp;About line endings</h2>
Every time you press <kbd>return</kbd> on your keyboard you insert an invisible character called a line ending. Different operating systems handle line endings differently.
When you're collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub, Git might produce unexpected results if, for example, you're working on a Windows machine, and your collaborator has made a change in macOS.
You can configure Git to handle line endings automatically so you can collaborate effectively with people who use different operating systems.
<h2>&emsp;Global settings for line endings</h2>
The <code>git config core.autocrlf</code> command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument.

On macOS, you simply pass <code>input</code> to the configuration. For example:
<code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for macOS</code>

On Windows, you simply pass <code>true</code> to the configuration. For example:
<code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for Windows.
# For compatibility, line endings are converted to Unix style when you commit files.</code>

On Linux, you simply pass <code>input</code> to the configuration. For example:
<code>$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for Linux</code>

<h2>&emsp;Per-repository settings</h2>
Optionally, you can configure a <em>.gitattributes</em> file to manage how Git reads line endings in a specific repository. When you commit this file to a repository, it overrides the <code>core.autocrlf</code> setting for all repository contributors. This ensures consistent behavior for all users, regardless of their Git settings and environment.
The <em>.gitattributes</em> file must be created in the root of the repository and committed like any other file.
A <em>.gitattributes</em> file looks like a table with two columns:

On the left is the file name for Git to match.
On the right is the line ending configuration that Git should use for those files.

<h3>
Example</h3>
Here's an example <em>.gitattributes</em> file. You can use it as a template for your repositories:
<code># Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
*.c text
*.h text

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.sln text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
</code>
You'll notice that files are matched—<code>*.c</code>, <code>*.sln</code>, <code>*.png</code>—, separated by a space, then given a setting—<code>text</code>, <code>text eol=crlf</code>, <code>binary</code>. We'll go over some possible settings below.

<code>text=auto</code> Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best. This is a good default option.

<code>text eol=crlf</code> Git will always convert line endings to <code>CRLF</code> on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep <code>CRLF</code> endings, even on OSX or Linux.

<code>text eol=lf</code> Git will always convert line endings to <code>LF</code> on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows.

<code>binary</code> Git will understand that the files specified are not text, and it should not try to change them. The <code>binary</code> setting is also an alias for <code>-text -diff</code>.

<h2>&emsp;Refreshing a repository after changing line endings</h2>
When you set the <code>core.autocrlf</code> option or commit a <em>.gitattributes</em> file, you may find that Git reports changes to files that you have not modified. Git has changed line endings to match your new configuration.
To ensure that all the line endings in your repository match your new configuration, backup your files with Git, delete all files in your repository (except the <code>.git</code> directory), then restore the files all at once.

Save your current files in Git, so that none of your work is lost.
<code>$ git add . -u
$ git commit -m "Saving files before refreshing line endings"</code>

Add all your changed files back and normalize the line endings.
<code>$ git add --renormalize .</code>

Show the rewritten, normalized files.
<code>$ git status</code>

Commit the changes to your repository.
<code>$ git commit -m "Normalize all the line endings"</code>

<h2><span class="orange">Ignoring files</span></h2>

You can configure Git to ignore files you don't want to check in to GitHub.

<h2>&emsp;Configuring ignored files for a single repository</h2>
You can create a <em>.gitignore</em> file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit.
To share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository, commit the <em>.gitignore</em> file in to your repository.
GitHub maintains an official list of recommended <em>.gitignore</em> files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages in the <code>github/gitignore</code> public repository. You can also use gitignore.io to create a <em>.gitignore</em> file for your operating system, programming language, or IDE. For more information, see "<a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">github/gitignore</a>" and the "<a href="https://www.gitignore.io/">gitignore.io</a>" site.

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.

Navigate to the location of your Git repository.

Create a <em>.gitignore</em> file for your repository.
<code>$ touch .gitignore</code>
If the command succeeds, there will be no output.

For an example <em>.gitignore</em> file, see "<a href="https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657">Some common .gitignore configurations</a>" in the Octocat repository.
If you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.
<code>$ git rm --cached FILENAME</code>
<h2>&emsp;Configuring ignored files for all repositories on your computer</h2>
You can also create a global <em>.gitignore</em> file to define a list of rules for ignoring files in every Git repository on your computer. For example, you might create the file at <em>~/.gitignore_global</em> and add some rules to it.

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.
Configure Git to use the exclude file <em>~/.gitignore_global</em> for all Git repositories.
<code>$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global</code>

<h2>&emsp;Excluding local files without creating a <em>.gitignore</em> file</h2>
If you don't want to create a <em>.gitignore</em> file to share with others, you can create rules that are not committed with the repository. You can use this technique for locally-generated files that you don't expect other users to generate, such as files created by your editor.
Use your favorite text editor to open the file called <em>.git/info/exclude</em> within the root of your Git repository. Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will only ignore files for your local repository.

Open Terminal Terminal Git Bash.
Navigate to the location of your Git repository.
Using your favorite text editor, open the file <em>.git/info/exclude</em>.
