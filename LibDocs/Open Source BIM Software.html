<br>

<h2>What is this “BIM” anyway?</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.capterra.com/top-34-bim-resources/" target="_blank">Building information modelling</a> is a process to help manage complexity and improve performance in construction projects. <br>
Using BIM as a software application gives users the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>3D visualization of buildings.</b> Your construction team can work better together, as well as with customers and subcontractors. <br>
Spot and correct errors in 3D designs before they happen in real life, or fix them faster afterward.</li>
<li><b>Change management.</b> Alterations to building structures and furnishings can be automatically checked, conflicts identified, and quality improved.</li>
<li><b>Construction simulation.</b> Try out different designs and optimize for the best cost-performance ratio while ensuring overall construction soundness and safety.</li>
<li><b>Data management.</b> Attach different kinds of project data (schedules, photos, scans of handwritten notes) to be able to find it all again in one place.</li>
<li><b>Operational management.</b> Check building performance (energy consumption for example) over the lifetime of a building and improve efficiency in remodels and extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many users and software developers stop at the first benefit. <br>
They consider BIM to be a kind of glorified <a href="https://www.capterra.com/engineering-cad-software/">computer-aided design</a> (CAD). <br>

<h2>Reasons for considering free or open source BIM software</h2>
<p>At first glance, it seems obvious. <br>
“<a href="https://blog.capterra.com/is-your-existing-construction-management-software-really-free/" target="_blank">Free construction software</a>” should help you save money. <br>
However, as any IT manager will tell you, initial software costs are often a small proportion of the real cost of using software, including staff time and effort to learn and use it. <br>

<h2>Construction manager or software geek?</h2>
<p>To help you decide, we'll categorize options for free and open source BIM software into the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Free BIM viewer. <br>
</b>Although BIM advantages can go much further (see above), an application to view 3D models of buildings can help to get workers and customers into the mode of using BIM.</li>
<li><b>Standard office application-based BIM.</b> Business information modelling may sound complicated, but sometimes a standard spreadsheet is all you need.</li>
<li><b>BIM as a bolt-on for CAD software.</b> While purists argue that BIM software should be designed and built separately, this can be a pragmatic way of getting into building information modelling.</li>
<li><b>The BIM software toolkit.</b> A software toolkit can be adapted or used to build a variety of BIM solutions, including extensions to existing applications. <br>
However, that means possessing or having access to the relevant software programming skills.</li>
<li><b>BIM from the start</b>. <br>
In this case, the BIM software has been built expressly for building information modelling. <br>
Instead of trying to twist 2D or 3D drawings into BIM, this kind of BIM application gives you digital building blocks from which to make adaptable, purpose-built BIM projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Free BIM Viewer</h2>
<div id="attachment_18452" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-18452 size-full" src="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/viewer.png" alt="viewer" width="460" height="262" srcset="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/viewer.png 460w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/viewer-160x91.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of BIMx from Graphisoft</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/168453/BIMx/">BIMx from Graphisoft</a> is available free of charge for Android and iOS devices. <br>
</p>
<p>As an interactive 3D communication and presentation tool, it lets users upload a 3D drawing and explore it. <br>
Construction companies can take advantage of BIMx to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show customers what they will get, and why they should sign that contract (now!)</li>
<li>Show workers on site what the end result will be and therefore how each intermediate step should contribute to that result</li>
<li>Get precise feedback from workers and supervisors about any problems in the construction process by indicating where in the drawing the issue is occurring.</li>
</ul>
<p>An iPad or Android tablet offers mobility, as well as a camera for taking pictures of problems and the ability to attach accompanying notes (although the website says that the free app is for viewing only and mostly intended for clients). <br>
BIMx also won a mobile Product of the Year Award as a testimony to its quality and user friendliness.</p>
<p>Another option is <a href="http://bimvision.eu/en/free-ifc-model-viewer/">BIM Vision</a>, a freeware IFC model viewer that allows the user to view virtual models created by systems such as <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/2011/AutoCAD-LT/">Revit</a>, Archicad, Advance, DDS CAD, Tekla, and Nemetschek VectorWorks, just to name a few. <br>
IFC stands for “<a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000447.shtml">Industry Foundation Class</a>,” which is another kind of data model for describing building and construction industry data.</p>
<p>The software allows for lots of tweaking of the 3D model, including coloring elements based on the type, setting the transparency level for creating cross-sections, and comparisons of models to show the geometry changes and element properties. <br>
You can also load multiple IFC files in one view for side-by-side comparisons.</p>
<p>BIM Vision works on a PC or tablet with Windows 7 or newer, so Apple users are out of luck.</p>
<h2>Standard office application-based BIM</h2>
<div id="attachment_18453" style="width: 629px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-18453" src="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NBSrenamedParameters.png" alt="Image from Practical BIM" width="619" height="603" srcset="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NBSrenamedParameters.png 619w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NBSrenamedParameters-93x91.png 93w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NBSrenamedParameters-32x32.png 32w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NBSrenamedParameters-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image from Practical BIM</p></div>
<p><i></i>Do Microsoft Excel and the free <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/160717/Apache-OpenOffice/">OpenOffice Calc</a> qualify as BIM software? According to initiatives such as COBie (<a href="http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/whatIsCOBie.asp" target="_blank">Construction Operations Building Information Exchange</a>), the answer is yes. <br>
</p>
<p>COBie is a data format designed for the capture and recording of important building project data. <br>
</p>
<p>The data can be recorded in a spreadsheet, which can then be used as input for other software applications. <br>
In June 2011, the UK government set out a five-year plan to bring 3D BIM in for all its construction projects (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61152/Government-Construction-Strategy_0.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>). <br>
The requirement for the first year was COBie: a “spreadsheet containing as much information about a building in as complete and as useful form as possible.”</p>
<p>COBie and similar data formats also highlight another interesting point. <br>
BIM isn't only about 3D drawings. <br>
In fact, BIM can also exist without any such drawings at all as information in a COBie spreadsheet.</p>
<h2>BIM as a bolt-on for CAD software</h2>
<div id="attachment_18454" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-18454 size-medium" src="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rim_bling-720x405.png" alt="Rim_bling" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rim_bling-720x405.png 720w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rim_bling-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rim_bling-1080x608.png 1080w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rim_bling-162x91.png 162w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of FreeCAD</p></div>
<p>BIM and <a href="https://www.capterra.com/engineering-cad-software/">engineering CAD software</a> are two different approaches to building design. <br>
</p>
<p>In a perfect world they would stay separate. <br>
However, in the real world, compromises are sometimes necessary in order to get building projects done.<a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/167527/FreeCAD/"> FreeCAD</a> offers such a compromise. <br>
It is a CAD program that offers BIM functionality as an extension to help users handle BIM as a process.</p>
<p>In particular, FreeCAD offers “IFC compatibility.” FreeCAD also states that its functionality can be activated and driven by other software programs written in Python. <br>
Python is reputed for its relative user-friendliness, but for most people, it's “geek-speak” all the same.</p>
<p>In summary, FreeCAD offers a way for users already familiar with CAD to get a head start along the road to BIM, but those without any software programming knowledge may find it tough going.</p>
<h2>The BIM software toolkit</h2>
<div id="attachment_18455" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-18455 size-full" src="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1385947943HJApSlLS.png" alt="1385947943HJApSlLS" width="636" height="288" srcset="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1385947943HJApSlLS.png 636w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1385947943HJApSlLS-182x82.png 182w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of xBIM</p></div>
<p>The phrase “software toolkit” instantly indicates a need for some serious software engineering capability in order to get any further. <br>
The challenge is to make the connection between the software constructs and terminology and a practical solution that helps your construction business. <br>
Unfortunately, some free toolkits or platforms seem to get stuck at the software stage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/129067/GitHub/" target="_blank">xBIM</a> (eXtensible Building Information Modeling) makes an effort to help users cross over the chasm and get to business value. <br>
While created as a software development toolkit, it offers practical examples of use in real life building contexts. <br>
It may take a software engineer to figure out the references to middleware and APIs (application programming interfaces), but other aspects are easier to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>xBIM makes it relatively easy to manipulate the IFC building elements. <br>
You can work with beams, panels, doors, windows, teams, processes, and other “real life” entities to make a BIM representation of your construction project.</li>
<li>xBIM offers the ability to create new functions to extend the possibilities of commercial BIM tools such as <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/2011/AutoCAD-LT/">Autodesk Revit</a>.</li>
<li>Sample applications based on xBIM are available. <br>
For instance, the iCIM (<a href="http://www.openbim.org/case-studies/interoperable-carbon-information-modelling" target="_blank">Interoperable Carbon Information Modeling</a>) online tool lets designers assess the carbon impact of their design decisions throughout the lifecycle of a building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another option is <a href="http://bimserver.org/">BIMserver</a>, which was created on the premise that no two construction projects are the same, and therefore construction managers need focused applications that can do one thing very well.</p>
<p>BIMserver is a platform that allows you to build a niche application perfectly suited for your project, although you&#8217;ll need some programming expertise to get started. <br>
The software is published under the GNU Affero GPLv3 license, so it's free to use and modify. <br>
You can use this software to create your own BIM tool from the ground up, or modify other tools out there to fit your unique situation.</p>
<p>BIMserver&#8217;s core features include storing all revisions, open BIM standards, cloud capabilities, lots of interfaces, and a plug-in framework for easier fine-tuning, to name a few.</p>
<h2>BIM from the Start</h2>
<div id="attachment_18456" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-18456 size-medium" src="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B-proc-screen-ruinhall-720x405.jpg" alt="B-proc-screen-ruinhall" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B-proc-screen-ruinhall-720x405.jpg 720w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B-proc-screen-ruinhall-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B-proc-screen-ruinhall-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://blog.capterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B-proc-screen-ruinhall-162x91.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of B-processor</p></div>
<p>An intuitive free BIM offering in this category is “<a href="http://b-processor.dk/" target="_blank">B-processor</a>.” </p>
<p>B-processor has been created from the start for BIM, and not as an add-on to a CAD software product. <br>
The 3D modeling of a building is relatively simple to learn. <br>
As spaces (such as rooms) and structures (such as  walls) are put into place, users add further information (“tags”) to each element to describe its properties and function. <br>
These tags can then be used to provide total cost information, cost breakdowns, carbon footprint data, alerts about design conflicts, and more. <br>
 </p>
<p>B-processor also keeps manipulation of each model simple too, with the possibility to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Modelers”: tools for repetitive tasks and the creation of detailed elements</li>
<li>“Evalors”: tools for processes such as calculating areas, energy consumption, and structural properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another BIM project,<a href="http://www.openbim.org/case-studies/4-bim" target="_blank"> 4BIM</a>, offers similar “native” BIM functionality, this time as an online software service. <br>
As an open source solution, it too has its sights set on practical functionality to help designers and builders.</p>
<ul>
<li>An online viewer for 3D BIM models with access from a standard web browser. <br>
Construction project members are able to use the 3D BIM models without any significant learning effort.</li>
<li>An online review system for the data attached to a BIM model, following the IFC model of standard data formats and constructs.</li>
<li>Collaborative teamwork functions to view, merge and further process multiple BIM files, with tracking of changes in models and alerts about such changes being made.</li>
<li>A reporting system to pick out useful information now and in the future, such as the information for a bill of quantities or the highlighting of project conflicts.</li>
<li>A facilities management handover service to make relevant information available to clients or other parties, using the standard COBie 2 (see above for COBie) data format.</li>
<li>A mobile application for Android and iPhone/iPad device users to access and interact with BIM data in a project.</li>
</ul>
<p>4BIM offers most or even all of the BIM benefits listed at the beginning of this article, without making builders jump through any software engineering hoops.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile, back at the commercial vendors ranch…</h2>
<p>Credit where credit is due; commercial CAD solution vendors such as Autodesk and <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/29995/Vectorworks-Architect/">Nemetschek </a>(maker of <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/29995/Vectorworks-Architect/">Graphisoft</a>, among other products) have also actively promoted common building data formats. <br>
This makes it easier to exchange such data between different programs. <br>
</p>
<p>The initiative to define the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) started in 1994 when Autodesk formed an industry consortium on the subject. <br>
The consortium then became a nonprofit industry-led organization to develop and maintain IFC specifications, and is now called<a href="http://www.buildingsmart.org/" target="_blank"> buildingSMART</a>, the eight tool in our list.</p>
<p>Independently of how commercial vendors view free and new solutions such as 4BIM, open standards to help interworking are in everybody's best interest.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building information modeling is increasingly part of any and all construction activities. <br>
While some clients choose to make it mandatory, BIM offers benefits to all players in the construction industry, whether they are architects, designers, engineers, or builders. <br>
This is as true for smaller companies as it is for larger ones.</p>
<p>Free and open source <a href="https://capterra.com/bim-software/">BIM software</a> must be selected with care however. <br>
In this case, the size of the user's organization does matter. <br>
Smaller construction companies may not have the internal software skills or resources to work with some of the more complex open source BIM programs or toolkits. <br>
Even larger companies will need to size up the effort required to put such programs to practical use. <br>
On the other hand, other free and open source solutions such as BIMx, B-processor, and 4BIM offer real possibilities to become part of the BIM scene and to do better business because of it.</p>
