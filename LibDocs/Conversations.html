<b>A:</b> I would if I had the money.
<b>B:</b> Well, I guess you have to live with it.
<b>A:</b> Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.
<b>B:</b> You don't want to do that.

<b>B:</b> You might hit someone in the head.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-14"><b>A:</b> What's for dinner?</span>

<b>A:</b> That's a good idea.
<b>B:</b> I found a button in my pant cuffs one time.

<b>A:</b> I will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.

<b>B:</b> "MI" stands for Middle Initial.

<b>A:</b> Don't ask me.
<b>B:</b> Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.

<b>A:</b> Anyway, I have to fix the hole.
<b>B:</b> You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
<b>A:</b> Tell me about this patch.
<b>B:</b> The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
<b>A:</b> That sounds a lot easier than sewing.

<b>A:</b> Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."
<b>B:</b> But people still write poems.
<b>A:</b> No one makes any money at it.
<b>B:</b> Shakespeare was a poet.
<b>A:</b> Did he get rich from his poetry?
<b>B:</b> Probably not.
<b>A:</b> Poems are a little bit like songs.
<b>B:</b> Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-72"><b>A:</b> How smart are you?</span>
<b>B:</b> I don't know. I think I'm average.
<b>A:</b> Did you ever take an IQ test?
<b>B:</b> No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.
<b>A:</b> I wish I was really smart.
<b>B:</b> Don't be ridiculous.
<b>A:</b> What do you mean?
<b>B:</b> If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
<b>A:</b> Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
<b>B:</b> It must be very lonely.
<b>A:</b> Why's that?
<b>B:</b> Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-73"><b>A:</b> I missed the TV news last night. What was on?</span>
<b>B:</b> Nothing that would pass as news.
<b>A:</b> What's the weather going to be like this weekend?
<b>B:</b> I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.
<b>A:</b> What was the lead story on the news?
<b>B:</b> Some actress was in court for driving without a license.
<b>A:</b> What was the second story?
<b>B:</b> Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
<b>A:</b> What was the third story?
<b>B:</b> A bull chased a man in a supermarket.
<b>A:</b> Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?
<b>B:</b> Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-74"><b>A:</b> What are you going to do about your death?</span>
<b>B:</b> Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.
<b>A:</b> I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
<b>B:</b> My wife and I will be cremated.
<b>A:</b> Are you going to be buried next to each other?
<b>B:</b> Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
<b>A:</b> You're not going to be buried?
<b>B:</b> A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
<b>A:</b> Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
<b>B:</b> Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
<b>A:</b> That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
<b>B:</b> We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-75"><b>A:</b> Did you wipe your feet? </span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, of course I wiped my feet.
<b>A:</b> Then why is there mud on the carpet?
<b>B:</b> I don't know. It's not my mud.
<b>A:</b> Well, someone brought it into the house.
<b>B:</b> Look at the bottom of my shoes�they're clean.
<b>A:</b> Of course they're clean. You left all the mud on the carpet.
<b>B:</b> Okay, I'll get the vacuum cleaner.
<b>A:</b> Don't vacuum it now.
<b>B:</b> Don't you want me to clean up the mud?
<b>A:</b> Wait till it dries. It will be easier to vacuum.
<b>B:</b> Next time I will be more careful.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-76"><b>A:</b> What are you getting for your mom?</span>
<b>B:</b> What are you talking about?
<b>A:</b> Sunday is Mother's Day.
<b>B:</b> This Sunday?
<b>A:</b> Of course. It's all over the news.
<b>B:</b> I thought it was next Sunday.
<b>A:</b> Well, you'd better get her something.
<b>B:</b> I'll get her a nice card.
<b>A:</b> Is that it?
<b>B:</b> Yes. That's all I ever give her.
<b>A:</b> She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
<b>B:</b> It's okay. She knows that I love her.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-77"><b>A:</b> I don't like our flag.</span>
<b>B:</b> What's the matter with it?
<b>A:</b> It's too much like other flags.
<b>B:</b> Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
<b>A:</b> A flag should be pretty.
<b>B:</b> What should our flag look like?
<b>A:</b> It should have a pretty woman on it.
<b>B:</b> That's ridiculous!
<b>A:</b> You don't like pretty women?
<b>B:</b> Of course I do. But not on our flag!
<b>A:</b> Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
<b>B:</b> You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-78"><b>A:</b> I had a busy morning.</span>
<b>B:</b> What did you do?
<b>A:</b> I watered all the plants.
<b>B:</b> You have a lot of plants.
<b>A:</b> Then I did my laundry.
<b>B:</b> That takes some time.
<b>A:</b> I took the dog for a walk.
<b>B:</b> I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
<b>A:</b> I vacuumed the entire house.
<b>B:</b> That's a lot of work.
<b>A:</b> And then I made lunch.
<b>B:</b> I'll bet you were hungry!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-79"><b>A:</b> I don't have long distance service with my home phone.</span>
<b>B:</b> So how do you make long distance calls?
<b>A:</b> I use a calling card.
<b>B:</b> Where do you get that?
<b>A:</b> I buy it at the dollar store.
<b>B:</b> How much is it?
<b>A:</b> It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
<b>B:</b> That's only a penny a minute!
<b>A:</b> It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
<b>B:</b> How many?
<b>A:</b> First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
<b>B:</b> Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-80"><b>A:</b> I've got a date for you.</span>
<b>B:</b> Oh, really?
<b>A:</b> Are you interested?
<b>B:</b> Maybe. What is she like?
<b>A:</b> She's got a great personality.
<b>B:</b> Uh-oh. That means that she's fat and ugly.
<b>A:</b> She's cute.
<b>B:</b> Okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
<b>A:</b> She weighs 98 pounds.
<b>B:</b> Okay, she's not fat. So what's the problem with her?
<b>A:</b> Who said there is a problem with her?
<b>B:</b> The problem is she has no problems�she's too good for me!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-81"><b>A:</b> I think you're very pretty.</span>
<b>B:</b> Thank you.
<b>A:</b> Would you have dinner with me?
<b>B:</b> I would like to.
<b>A:</b> Can I pick you up Friday night?
<b>B:</b> What time?
<b>A:</b> Eight o'clock.
<b>B:</b> That sounds great.
<b>A:</b> We'll go to a French restaurant.
<b>B:</b> I've never been to a French restaurant.
<b>A:</b> I think you'll love the food.
<b>B:</b> I'm not going to eat any snails!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-82"><b>A:</b> You have pretty eyes.</span>
<b>B:</b> Thank you. So do you.
<b>A:</b> I wish my eyes were blue.
<b>B:</b> What's the matter with green eyes?
<b>A:</b> Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
<b>B:</b> Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
<b>A:</b> But what if I'm a fish in my next life?
<b>B:</b> I think some fish have blue eyes.
<b>A:</b> I hope I don't come back as a fish.
<b>B:</b> I hope I come back as a cat.
<b>A:</b> Cats have beautiful eyes.
<b>B:</b> I would love to have blue cat-eyes.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-83"><b>A:</b> I love you.</span>
<b>B:</b> I love you, too.
<b>A:</b> I loved you the first day I saw you.
<b>B:</b> It was love at first sight?
<b>A:</b> Yes, it was love at first sight.
<b>B:</b> I didn't love you at first.
<b>A:</b> I know. I had to chase you for a while.
<b>B:</b> Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.
<b>A:</b> Now you're mine forever.
<b>B:</b> And you're mine forever.
<b>A:</b> We'll grow old together.
<b>B:</b> And be happy together.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-84"><b>A:</b> I'm in love with that girl.</span>
<b>B:</b> Have you told her?
<b>A:</b> Of course not.
<b>B:</b> Why not?
<b>A:</b> She would laugh at me.
<b>B:</b> How do you know?
<b>A:</b> Because they always do.
<b>B:</b> Maybe she's different.
<b>A:</b> They're all the same.
<b>B:</b> Just ask her out to dinner.
<b>A:</b> And then what?
<b>B:</b> And then she'll know that you like her.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-85"><b>A:</b> Give me a hug.</span>
<b>B:</b> I'm not in the mood.
<b>A:</b> What's the matter?
<b>B:</b> I saw you looking at that woman.
<b>A:</b> What woman?
<b>B:</b> You know, that woman with the big boobs.
<b>A:</b> I was not looking at her.
<b>B:</b> You were, too.
<b>A:</b> I'm not interested in her.
<b>B:</b> Then why were you looking at her?
<b>A:</b> I was looking at something else.
<b>B:</b> Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-86"><b>A:</b> Would you like to go on a blind date?</span>
<b>B:</b> You must be joking.
<b>A:</b> No, I'm serious.
<b>B:</b> I don't want to date a blind woman.
<b>A:</b> A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
<b>B:</b> What does it mean?
<b>A:</b> A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
<b>B:</b> Why would I date someone I don't even know?
<b>A:</b> To try something new and exciting.
<b>B:</b> What if I don't like her?
<b>A:</b> Then you don't date her again.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-87"><b>A:</b> I have a date tomorrow night.</span>
<b>B:</b> Really? Who with?
<b>A:</b> A girl I met at the market.
<b>B:</b> You met a girl at the supermarket?
<b>A:</b> She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
<b>B:</b> What did you say to her?
<b>A:</b> I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.
<b>B:</b> She asked you about your pineapples?
<b>A:</b> I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.
<b>B:</b> That was nice of you.
<b>A:</b> She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.
<b>B:</b> Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-88"><b>A:</b> Did you have a date Friday night?</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, in fact, I did.
<b>A:</b> Who did you go out with?
<b>B:</b> A man I met in a coffee shop.
<b>A:</b> Where did you go?
<b>B:</b> We went to a nice restaurant.
<b>A:</b> Anywhere else?
<b>B:</b> Then we went to a jazz club.
<b>A:</b> That sounds like a nice date.
<b>B:</b> Yes, it was pleasant.
<b>A:</b> But you won't date him again?
<b>B:</b> No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-89"><b>A:</b> I had the worst date the other night.</span>
<b>B:</b> What happened?
<b>A:</b> First of all, he was half an hour late.
<b>B:</b> That's not a good start.
<b>A:</b> Then he didn't bother to apologize.
<b>B:</b> That's rude.
<b>A:</b> Then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
<b>B:</b> That's dangerous.
<b>A:</b> I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
<b>B:</b> What happened at the restaurant?
<b>A:</b> We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
<b>B:</b> I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-90"><b>A:</b> I don't like that man.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why not?
<b>A:</b> He's a dirty old man.
<b>B:</b> What do you mean?
<b>A:</b> He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
<b>B:</b> Well, you can't blame a man for asking.
<b>A:</b> He should act his age.
<b>B:</b> But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
<b>A:</b> They should find a nice hobby.
<b>B:</b> Just wait until you're 50 years old.
<b>A:</b> Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
<b>B:</b> That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-91"><b>A:</b> Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?</span>
<b>B:</b> Sometimes.
<b>A:</b> What does she do?
<b>B:</b> Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.
<b>A:</b> That was a nice thing to say.
<b>B:</b> That's what I thought.
<b>A:</b> What did she say?
<b>B:</b> She laughed! She didn't believe me.
<b>A:</b> That wasn't very nice of her.
<b>B:</b> She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
<b>A:</b> What did you say?
<b>B:</b> I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-92"><b>A:</b> Some people have good noses.</span>
<b>B:</b> I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.
<b>A:</b> I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.
<b>B:</b> Oh. But that can be a curse.
<b>A:</b> Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
<b>B:</b> I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
<b>A:</b> Did she catch you using drugs?
<b>B:</b> Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
<b>A:</b> You don't need a good nose for that�cigarettes stink.
<b>B:</b> But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
<b>A:</b> Boy, that is a good nose.
<b>B:</b> I told her she should apply for a job at customs.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-93"><b>A:</b> Did you see "Titanic"?</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes. It is a great movie.
<b>A:</b> I saw it twelve times.
<b>B:</b> I saw it eight times.
<b>A:</b> I have the DVD.
<b>B:</b> So do I.
<b>A:</b> Let's go to your home.
<b>B:</b> We can watch my DVD.
<b>A:</b> And then we can go to my home.
<b>B:</b> And watch your DVD.
<b>A:</b> I always cry at the end.
<b>B:</b> Me too. It's so sad.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-94"><b>A:</b> Let's play cards.</span>
<b>B:</b> I don't know any card games.
<b>A:</b> I'll teach you one.
<b>B:</b> Okay. What will you teach me?
<b>A:</b> It's called poker.
<b>B:</b> Is it easy to learn?
<b>A:</b> Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
<b>B:</b> Okay. Teach me how to play.
<b>A:</b> We each get five cards.
<b>B:</b> Oh, look. I have four tens.
<b>A:</b> That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
<b>B:</b> Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-95"><b>A:</b> I'm a good card player.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why is that?
<b>A:</b> Because I watch the other players.
<b>B:</b> What do you mean?
<b>A:</b> People will tell you if they have a good hand.
<b>B:</b> How do they do that?
<b>A:</b> For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
<b>B:</b> When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
<b>A:</b> I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
<b>B:</b> He never wins your money?
<b>A:</b> Nope, and it drives him crazy.
<b>B:</b> He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-96"><b>A:</b> Turn the radio down, please.</span>
<b>B:</b> But I'm listening to it.
<b>A:</b> Well, listen to it more quietly.
<b>B:</b> I can't wait till I grow up.
<b>A:</b> What will you do?
<b>B:</b> I will play the radio as loud as I want.
<b>A:</b> That's okay with me.
<b>B:</b> I will have a radio in every room of my house.
<b>A:</b> Remind me to never visit you.
<b>B:</b> All the radios will be on extra loud.
<b>A:</b> Your neighbors will hate you.
<b>B:</b> If they don't like it, they can move.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-97"><b>A:</b> I hope I win the lotto.</span>
<b>B:</b> Your chances are very small.
<b>A:</b> But you can't win if you don't play.
<b>B:</b> Ha! You can't win if you do play.
<b>A:</b> Someone has to win.
<b>B:</b> That's what everyone says.
<b>A:</b> It might as well be me.
<b>B:</b> That's what everyone says.
<b>A:</b> You're trying to tell me something.
<b>B:</b> That didn't take long.
<b>A:</b> You think I should quit playing.
<b>B:</b> Save your money for school.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-98"><b>A:</b> What's on TV?</span>
<b>B:</b> Nothing much.
<b>A:</b> What about the baseball game?
<b>B:</b> It got rained out.
<b>A:</b> Rained out?
<b>B:</b> Yes, rained out.
<b>A:</b> How could that be?
<b>B:</b> Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
<b>A:</b> I thought they were playing under a dome.
<b>B:</b> The dome doesn't close.
<b>A:</b> Why doesn't it close?
<b>B:</b> Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-99"><b>A:</b> Can I try your coffee?</span>
<b>B:</b> Sure. Here you go.
<b>A:</b> Hmm, that's not bad.
<b>B:</b> There's nothing in it.
<b>A:</b> What do you mean?
<b>B:</b> I mean, it's just coffee.
<b>A:</b> I figured that.
<b>B:</b> It's not too bitter for you?
<b>A:</b> It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
<b>B:</b> There's no sugar or cream in it.
<b>A:</b> No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
<b>B:</b> Sort of like beer.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-100"><b>A:</b> Let's take a walk.</span>
<b>B:</b> What's the weather like?
<b>A:</b> Let me step outside and see.
<b>B:</b> It's a little chilly, right?
<b>A:</b> Yes, it is.
<b>B:</b> I'll put on my cap.
<b>A:</b> Wear a jacket, too.
<b>B:</b> I wonder if I should bring my gloves.
<b>A:</b> Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
<b>B:</b> I'll put a glove in each pocket.
<b>A:</b> We'll get warmer as we walk.
<b>B:</b> Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-101"><b>A:</b> Look at the car chase on TV!</span>
<b>B:</b> That driver is crazy.
<b>A:</b> I can't believe he hasn't crashed.
<b>B:</b> How fast is he going?
<b>A:</b> They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
<b>B:</b> He's going to kill someone.
<b>A:</b> Look! He just hit that car.
<b>B:</b> Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.

<b>B:</b> Maybe he ran out of gas.
<b>A:</b> Look! He just got out of the car and started running.
<b>B:</b> I hope the police catch him.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-102"><b>A:</b> TV news is so stupid.</span>
<b>B:</b> They shouldn't even call it news.
<b>A:</b> Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
<b>B:</b> Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
<b>A:</b> Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
<b>B:</b> Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
<b>A:</b> The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
<b>B:</b> The sports guy shows us players fighting.
<b>A:</b> They always tell us "what's next."
<b>B:</b> They always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.
<b>A:</b> It's more like news for kids.
<b>B:</b> They should have kid reporters.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-103"><b>A:</b> I love my computer.</span>
<b>B:</b> Computers are so cool.
<b>A:</b> I love to go online.
<b>B:</b> The Internet is amazing.

<b>B:</b> So do I, like "She Loves You."
<b>A:</b> "She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!..."
<b>B:</b> "�And you know you should be glad!"

<b>B:</b> Okay, that won't be very crowded.
<b>A:</b> What would you like to see?
<b>B:</b> Oh, I don't care. You're the one who wants to go out.
<b>A:</b> Well, I want to see "The Pursuit of Happyness."

<b>B:</b> Well, it's one of them.
<b>A:</b> Where do you go to watch people?
<b>B:</b> My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.
<b>A:</b> That sounds like a good spot.
<b>B:</b> We watch people walk by with their dogs.
<b>A:</b> I guess you see lots of different dogs.
<b>B:</b> We don't even know what kind most of them are.
<b>A:</b> There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
<b>B:</b> Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-107"><b>A:</b> They call him Father Dollar Bill.</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, he was on the TV news today.
<b>A:</b> Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.
<b>B:</b> Is it his money?
<b>A:</b> No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
<b>B:</b> How much money does he give away?
<b>A:</b> This year he gave away $15,000.
<b>B:</b> That's a lot of money.
<b>A:</b> He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
<b>B:</b> What about the other homeless people?
<b>A:</b> They got $1 each.
<b>B:</b> People stood in line just to get one dollar?!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-108"><b>A:</b> Old movies are the best.</span>
<b>B:</b> Even though they're in black and white.
<b>A:</b> A good story is more important than color.
<b>B:</b> Actors didn't curse back then.
<b>A:</b> And there was no violence.
<b>B:</b> People today don't like that.
<b>A:</b> No, today people like lots of action.
<b>B:</b> I like a good story.
<b>A:</b> I like to see actors who are like real people.
<b>B:</b> Like real people with real problems.

<b>B:</b> Yes, but they never make much money.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-109"><b>A:</b> Do you get PBS on TV?</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.
<b>A:</b> It puts me to sleep.
<b>B:</b> Tell me about it.
<b>A:</b> A gardening show follows a knitting show.
<b>B:</b> A cooking show follows a sewing show.
<b>A:</b> A travel show follows another travel show.
<b>B:</b> I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!
<b>A:</b> Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
<b>B:</b> I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
<b>A:</b> If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.
<b>B:</b> Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-110"><b>A:</b> I love to watch "Judge Judy."</span>
<b>B:</b> Is that a TV show?
<b>A:</b> Yes. It's on every afternoon.
<b>B:</b> What's so good about it?
<b>A:</b> They have interesting lawsuits.
<b>B:</b> Such as?
<b>A:</b> Yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on eBay.
<b>B:</b> Was something wrong with the phone?
<b>A:</b> It works only in Canada.
<b>B:</b> Did the seller know that?
<b>A:</b> Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.
<b>B:</b> I hope Judge Judy made the seller take the phone back.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-111"><b>A:</b> That woman is a very good singer.</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, but she looks like a man.
<b>A:</b> What difference does it make?
<b>B:</b> Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
<b>A:</b> Singers are supposed to sound good.
<b>B:</b> They should look good, too.
<b>A:</b> There are lots of ugly men singers.
<b>B:</b> Men singers don't have to look good.
<b>A:</b> Then neither do women singers.
<b>B:</b> Well, I would never buy her CD.

<b>B:</b> Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.

<b>B:</b> What do you mean?
<b>A:</b> I can't get a single channel.
<b>B:</b> Do you have a digital TV?
<b>A:</b> Of course. But I don't have cable.
<b>B:</b> You don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.
<b>A:</b> But I have rabbit ears.
<b>B:</b> Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-113"><b>A:</b> I love salads.</span>
<b>B:</b> Me too.
<b>A:</b> I usually eat a simple salad.
<b>B:</b> What do you put in it?
<b>A:</b> Just lettuce, tomato, and celery.
<b>B:</b> That's it?
<b>A:</b> I add some pepper and salt.
<b>B:</b> I always put cheese in my salads.
<b>A:</b> Yes, cheese is nice.
<b>B:</b> What kind of dressing do you use?
<b>A:</b> I pour lots of French dressing on top.
<b>B:</b> Me too. French dressing is so delicious! Who cares about calories?

<span class="topic" id="chapter-114"><b>A:</b> I love cheese.</span>
<b>B:</b> Me too.
<b>A:</b> Where does cheese come from?
<b>B:</b> It comes from cows.
<b>A:</b> So we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?
<b>B:</b> Yes, we do.
<b>A:</b> What else do we get from cows?
<b>B:</b> We get hamburgers and steak.
<b>A:</b> Oh, that's so delicious.
<b>B:</b> We also get leather.
<b>A:</b> We get a lot of things from cows, don't we?
<b>B:</b> Yes. A cow is man's best friend.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-115"><b>A:</b> I used to work in a deli.</span>
<b>B:</b> How did you like it?
<b>A:</b> I loved it!
<b>B:</b> Did you get free food?
<b>A:</b> I ate free cheese and meat every day.
<b>B:</b> That sounds like a great job.
<b>A:</b> Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.
<b>B:</b> Did you get fat?
<b>A:</b> No, but I did put on a few pounds.
<b>B:</b> That sounds like a dream job.
<b>A:</b> It was, until one day my manager caught me.
<b>B:</b> No more free cheese for you, huh?

<span class="topic" id="chapter-116"><b>A:</b> I'm on a new diet.</span>
<b>B:</b> What are you eating now?
<b>A:</b> I switched from pasta to potatoes.
<b>B:</b> Why did you do that?
<b>A:</b> Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.
<b>B:</b> Natural food has more vitamins.
<b>A:</b> And it's just as easy to prepare.
<b>B:</b> How do you prepare the potatoes?
<b>A:</b> I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.
<b>B:</b> That's pretty simple.
<b>A:</b> Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.
<b>B:</b> Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?

<span class="topic" id="chapter-117"><b>A:</b> My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why was that?
<b>A:</b> I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
<b>B:</b> What's the matter with that?
<b>A:</b> Her mom is a great cook.
<b>B:</b> So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
<b>A:</b> It hurt her feelings.
<b>B:</b> Oh.
<b>A:</b> I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.
<b>B:</b> Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
<b>A:</b> I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
<b>B:</b> It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-118"><b>A:</b> I eat the same thing every day.</span>
<b>B:</b> You're kidding.
<b>A:</b> No, I'm serious.
<b>B:</b> Doesn't that get old?
<b>A:</b> No, because I'm eating food that I like.
<b>B:</b> But the same thing day after day gets old.
<b>A:</b> Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.
<b>B:</b> Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
<b>A:</b> No, I hate vegetables.
<b>B:</b> But you eat fruits.
<b>A:</b> I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
<b>B:</b> Well, there's nothing wrong with that.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-119"><b>A:</b> There's something wrong with my orange.</span>
<b>B:</b> What's wrong?
<b>A:</b> It's not orange!
<b>B:</b> Your orange isn't orange?
<b>A:</b> No, it's dark pink!
<b>B:</b> Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.
<b>A:</b> I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.
<b>B:</b> Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.
<b>A:</b> Who ever heard of such a thing?
<b>B:</b> Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.
<b>A:</b> What is this world coming to?
<b>B:</b> Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-120"><b>A:</b> I love peanuts.</span>
<b>B:</b> Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.
<b>A:</b> I love boiled peanuts.
<b>B:</b> Boiled? I never heard of that.
<b>A:</b> Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
<b>B:</b> I'll have to try them sometime.
<b>A:</b> They're best when they're hot.
<b>B:</b> My brother is allergic to peanuts.
<b>A:</b> That's not good.
<b>B:</b> No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.
<b>A:</b> I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
<b>B:</b> He has a very strict diet.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-121"><b>A:</b> I'm gaining weight.</span>
<b>B:</b> How much have you gained?
<b>A:</b> Three pounds just this month.
<b>B:</b> Do you know why?
<b>A:</b> I think it's the ice cream.
<b>B:</b> You started eating ice cream?
<b>A:</b> It was on sale.
<b>B:</b> How much did you buy?
<b>A:</b> I filled up my freezer with ice cream.
<b>B:</b> Well, it won't last forever.
<b>A:</b> No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.
<b>B:</b> Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-122"><b>A:</b> I'm stuffed.</span>
<b>B:</b> Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.
<b>A:</b> I don't like to eat leftovers.
<b>B:</b> I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
<b>A:</b> I like my food hot and fresh.
<b>B:</b> You like to see it disappear.
<b>A:</b> I don't like it reheated.
<b>B:</b> Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.
<b>A:</b> I'm so full I'm going to burst.
<b>B:</b> You should loosen your belt.
<b>A:</b> I already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
<b>B:</b> Well, don't stand up, please.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-123"><b>A:</b> I saw what you did.</span>
<b>B:</b> I didn't do anything.
<b>A:</b> Oh yes, you did.
<b>B:</b> What are you talking about?
<b>A:</b> You know what I'm talking about.
<b>B:</b> I don't have any idea.
<b>A:</b> You know what you did.
<b>B:</b> Maybe I know, but how could you know?
<b>A:</b> Because I was watching you.
<b>B:</b> Okay, I'm sorry I did it.
<b>A:</b> Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!
<b>B:</b> I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-124"><b>A:</b> I have a stomachache.</span>
<b>B:</b> Is it something you ate?
<b>A:</b> Maybe. I'm not sure.
<b>B:</b> What did you have for breakfast?
<b>A:</b> The usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
<b>B:</b> Maybe the milk was bad.
<b>A:</b> It didn't smell bad.
<b>B:</b> Maybe the banana was bad.
<b>A:</b> No, the banana was delicious.
<b>B:</b> Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
<b>A:</b> No, that's not the problem.
<b>B:</b> Maybe it will go away in a little while.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-125"><b>A:</b> What's this stain?</span>
<b>B:</b> I don't know.
<b>A:</b> It looks like blood.
<b>B:</b> I think my nose was bleeding.
<b>A:</b> You should wet your shirt immediately.
<b>B:</b> Why?
<b>A:</b> Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
<b>B:</b> What's a little blood?
<b>A:</b> Your white shirt is ruined.
<b>B:</b> So, I'll just buy another one.
<b>A:</b> You can wear this one around the house.
<b>B:</b> Next time I'll soak it immediately.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-126"><b>A:</b> My fingers hurt.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why do they hurt?
<b>A:</b> I type too much.
<b>B:</b> You should take a break.
<b>A:</b> I need to type to make money.
<b>B:</b> But typing is causing you pain.
<b>A:</b> Maybe I should see a doctor.
<b>B:</b> Doctors are too expensive.
<b>A:</b> He might tell me to rest for a while.
<b>B:</b> He might want to cut you open.
<b>A:</b> He might say I'm okay.
<b>B:</b> He might say you have bone cancer.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-127"><b>A:</b> What did the doctor say?</span>
<b>B:</b> He thinks I have too much stress.
<b>A:</b> Stress causes your stomachaches?
<b>B:</b> Stress causes different problems with different people.
<b>A:</b> So what did he tell you to do?
<b>B:</b> He said I need to think positive.
<b>A:</b> He didn't give you any medication?
<b>B:</b> I hate medication. It makes me feel different.
<b>A:</b> So how do you think positive?
<b>B:</b> I think about nice things.
<b>A:</b> Like what?
<b>B:</b> Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-128"><b>A:</b> I cut my finger.</span>
<b>B:</b> How did you do that?
<b>A:</b> It's a paper cut.
<b>B:</b> Paper can be dangerous.
<b>A:</b> It hurts, too.
<b>B:</b> Paper cuts can hurt a lot.
<b>A:</b> Where are the band-aids?
<b>B:</b> I think they're in the medicine cabinet.
<b>A:</b> It's on the tip of my finger.
<b>B:</b> A band-aid might not work.
<b>A:</b> I must not use this finger until the cut heals.
<b>B:</b> It might take a day or two to heal.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-129"><b>A:</b> Do you smell that?</span>
<b>B:</b> Oh, yes.
<b>A:</b> I can't stand cigarette smoke.
<b>B:</b> It smells so bad.
<b>A:</b> One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
<b>B:</b> Smokers think they are so cool.
<b>A:</b> They are so weak.
<b>B:</b> A little cigarette controls them.
<b>A:</b> They look so stupid taking a puff.
<b>B:</b> And then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
<b>A:</b> They think it's cool.
<b>B:</b> Cigarettes stink.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-130"><b>A:</b> Do you have a cold?</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, I do.
<b>A:</b> How did you get it?
<b>B:</b> My sister had a cold. She gave it to me.
<b>A:</b> Have you taken anything for your cold?
<b>B:</b> No, I just blow my nose a lot.
<b>A:</b> Your nose is stopped up?
<b>B:</b> Yes. I have to breathe through my mouth.
<b>A:</b> Have you tried nose drops?
<b>B:</b> No, I don't like nose drops.
<b>A:</b> They work great.
<b>B:</b> I don't care. I don't like to put drops in my nose.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-131"><b>A:</b> Would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?</span>
<b>B:</b> Sure.
<b>A:</b> Thank you.
<b>B:</b> You shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
<b>A:</b> I want to get a tan. I don't want to look so pale.
<b>B:</b> What's wrong with looking pale?
<b>A:</b> People think you might be sick.
<b>B:</b> Who thinks that?
<b>A:</b> I don't know.
<b>B:</b> It's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
<b>A:</b> I know that.
<b>B:</b> So why are you arguing with me? Don't lie in the sun too long!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-132"><b>A:</b> I can't quit smoking.</span>
<b>B:</b> Of course you can.
<b>A:</b> I don't have enough will power.
<b>B:</b> Of course you do.
<b>A:</b> I wish I had never started.
<b>B:</b> So does every smoker.
<b>A:</b> I've tried to quit so many times.
<b>B:</b> So has everyone else.
<b>A:</b> Nothing seems to work.
<b>B:</b> All it takes is will power, and you have it.
<b>A:</b> Then why can't I quit?
<b>B:</b> You have to believe in yourself.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-133"><b>A:</b> My back is killing me.</span>
<b>B:</b> What did you do?
<b>A:</b> I got out of my car.
<b>B:</b> That's it?
<b>A:</b> I injured my back one time just by sneezing.
<b>B:</b> You should see a doctor.
<b>A:</b> My doctor said I need surgery.
<b>B:</b> So?
<b>A:</b> So, forget it.
<b>B:</b> You don't have the money?
<b>A:</b> I have no insurance.
<b>B:</b> Maybe a back rub would help.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-134"><b>A:</b> My brother smokes three packs a day.</span>
<b>B:</b> Three packs of what?
<b>A:</b> Cigarettes, of course.
<b>B:</b> How can he do that?
<b>A:</b> When he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
<b>B:</b> He's a chain smoker.
<b>A:</b> He's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
<b>B:</b> That's unbelievable. Can he still breathe?
<b>A:</b> He can, but the people around him can't.
<b>B:</b> How can he still be alive?
<b>A:</b> His doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
<b>B:</b> Maybe I should start smoking.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-135"><b>A:</b> I hate brushing my teeth.</span>
<b>B:</b> It's such a chore.
<b>A:</b> Brush, brush. Spit, spit.
<b>B:</b> What did they do in the old days?
<b>A:</b> They brushed with their fingers.
<b>B:</b> They also ate with their fingers!
<b>A:</b> Why do they call it the good old days?
<b>B:</b> Maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
<b>A:</b> Who invented flossing?
<b>B:</b> A dentist, I'm sure.
<b>A:</b> I hate flossing more than brushing!
<b>B:</b> I can't wait till all my teeth fall out.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-136"><b>A:</b> Let's stop for a while. I need a break and some water.</span>

<b>A:</b> Thank goodness! I don't want to see any wild animals.
<b>B:</b> All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
<b>A:</b> We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.
<b>B:</b> I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.
<b>A:</b> All you've lost is some sweat.
<b>B:</b> I haven't even lost one pound of fat?
<b>A:</b> If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.
<b>B:</b> Okay, but let's hike in town. At least there are cats and dogs to see.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-137"><b>A:</b> Oh no, another pimple on my face.</span>
<b>B:</b> Pimples suck.
<b>A:</b> It seems like I get a new pimple almost every day.
<b>B:</b> Maybe it's something in your diet.
<b>A:</b> No, I eat the same things day after day.
<b>B:</b> Then maybe it's in your genes.
<b>A:</b> You might be right.
<b>B:</b> Do pimples run in your family?
<b>A:</b> Not that I've noticed.
<b>B:</b> Well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.
<b>A:</b> Whatever the cause, I hate seeing them on my face.
<b>B:</b> Well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-138"><b>A:</b> Do you believe everything you hear?</span>
<b>B:</b> I don't believe anything I don't see with my own eyes.
<b>A:</b> You can't believe what you hear on TV or radio.
<b>B:</b> You can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
<b>A:</b> Everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
<b>B:</b> Three different people will give you three different stories.
<b>A:</b> And the government will give you a fourth story.
<b>B:</b> Yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
<b>A:</b> But the swine flu just killed 20 people in Mexico.
<b>B:</b> The government says we have nothing to worry about.
<b>A:</b> Then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
<b>B:</b> The government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.

<b>A:</b> I think I know the difference between picking and scratching.
<b>B:</b> Okay, mom, maybe I was picking it a little bit.
<b>A:</b> Use a tissue next time.
<b>B:</b> I didn't have a tissue.
<b>A:</b> Then wait till you find a tissue.
<b>B:</b> I couldn't wait. It was an emergency.

<b>A:</b> I'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
<b>B:</b> Don't rub the numbers off the remote.
<b>A:</b> I will rub gently but firmly.
<b>B:</b> Do it quickly, please, so I can change channels during commercials.

<b>B:</b> What's the matter?
<b>A:</b> I was on a plane.
<b>B:</b> So?
<b>A:</b> So, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
<b>B:</b> That's no good.
<b>A:</b> Sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.
<b>B:</b> Have you seen a doctor?
<b>A:</b> I've been to two doctors.
<b>B:</b> And they couldn't fix your problem?
<b>A:</b> They both said I have to live with it.

<b>B:</b> Did she get a nice job?
<b>A:</b> She got an "everything" job!
<b>B:</b> What do you mean?
<b>A:</b> A team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
<b>B:</b> Why did they do that?
<b>A:</b> A mad dog bit most of her face off.
<b>B:</b> Oh, that's terrible. What does she look like now?
<b>A:</b> Her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
<b>B:</b> And then will she look normal again?

<b>A:</b> I don't know. I think it's old age.
<b>B:</b> If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?
<b>A:</b> That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.
<b>B:</b> Are you right-handed?
<b>A:</b> Yes. All my life.
<b>B:</b> You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.
<b>A:</b> But I do all my writing with my right hand.

<b>B:</b> We won't have any money for other things?
<b>A:</b> No, we won't have money for gas or food.
<b>B:</b> We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
<b>A:</b> Without the peanut butter!

<b>A:</b> What's the matter with it?
<b>B:</b> It's on the corner.
<b>A:</b> So?
<b>B:</b> That means it gets twice as much traffic.
<b>A:</b> You're right.
<b>B:</b> When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.
<b>A:</b> Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
<b>B:</b> Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
<b>A:</b> Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.

<b>B:</b> That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.
<b>A:</b> And it's a corner unit.
<b>B:</b> That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
<b>A:</b> No pets are allowed.
<b>B:</b> Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.
<b>A:</b> And there are only six units in the whole building.
<b>B:</b> Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.

<b>B:</b> Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.
<b>A:</b> It shouldn't take him long to fix it.
<b>B:</b> I don't even know why we need to fix it.

<b>A:</b> It's so nice to have a heated apartment.
<b>B:</b> How did they survive in the old days?

<b>A:</b> Our kids are completely safe.
<b>B:</b> So why are we selling our house?
<b>A:</b> They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
<b>B:</b> So we've got to sell before property values go down?
<b>A:</b> Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.

<b>B:</b> Okay, what kind of job do you want?

<b>B:</b> It's the law. They can't keep him in jail forever.
<b>A:</b> Why not? Everyone knows he's a firebug. He loves to start fires.
<b>B:</b> I don't know. Sometimes the law doesn't make sense.

<b>A:</b> Anything else?
<b>B:</b> I need a notebook.
<b>A:</b> Do you need a pen?
<b>B:</b> No. I already have a pen.
<b>A:</b> Do you need a calculator?
<b>B:</b> No. The teacher doesn't permit calculators.
<b>A:</b> How about a dictionary?
<b>B:</b> No, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.
<b>A:</b> Well, I guess that's it.
<b>B:</b> Yes, that's all I need for now.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-197"><b>A:</b> I like this magazine.</span>

<b>B:</b> I always read the film reviews.
<b>A:</b> I never miss the food and drink section.
<b>B:</b> I gave a subscription to my parents.

<b>B:</b> What were you doing?
<b>A:</b> I was writing a letter.
<b>B:</b> Who were you writing to?
<b>A:</b> It's to my mom.
<b>B:</b> Tell her I said hello.
<b>A:</b> Okay. I'll return your pen when I'm done.
<b>B:</b> Take your time.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-199"><b>A:</b> Have you done your homework?</span>
<b>B:</b> Not yet.
<b>A:</b> Then why are you watching TV?
<b>B:</b> This is my favorite show.
<b>A:</b> Go do your homework.
<b>B:</b> But, mom!
<b>A:</b> You can watch TV after you do your homework.
<b>B:</b> But the show will be over.
<b>A:</b> There will be another show next week.
<b>B:</b> Please?
<b>A:</b> You know the rules.
<b>B:</b> I hate the rules! I can't wait till I grow up.

<b>B:</b> I can't afford it.
<b>A:</b> Me neither.
<b>B:</b> So what are you going to do?
<b>A:</b> I'm joining the army.
<b>B:</b> You're kidding. You might get killed.
<b>A:</b> I don't think so. After I finish, I'll have enough money to go to college.
<b>B:</b> That's not a bad idea.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-201"><b>A:</b> What is your major?</span>
<b>B:</b> English.
<b>A:</b> What are you going to do with an English major?
<b>B:</b> I'm going to be a teacher.
<b>A:</b> High school or middle school?
<b>B:</b> High school.
<b>A:</b> I teach high school English.
<b>B:</b> I didn't know that.
<b>A:</b> I started teaching five years ago.
<b>B:</b> How do you like it?
<b>A:</b> Do you see all this gray hair? It was totally black five years ago.
<b>B:</b> Maybe I'll teach middle school.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-202"><b>A:</b> Parking at school is impossible.</span>
<b>B:</b> I'll say.
<b>A:</b> I drove around for half an hour.
<b>B:</b> Did you find a spot?
<b>A:</b> I found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.
<b>B:</b> Did you yell at them?
<b>A:</b> Yes, I did.
<b>B:</b> And?
<b>A:</b> And he yelled back at me.
<b>B:</b> How rude.
<b>A:</b> But I got lucky a few minutes later.
<b>B:</b> You have to be lucky to find a parking space.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-203"><b>A:</b> This is a huge library.</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space.
<b>A:</b> And lots of books.
<b>B:</b> And lots of thieves.
<b>A:</b> What do you mean?
<b>B:</b> I mean, keep your belongings close to you.
<b>A:</b> The only thing in my backpack is used books.
<b>B:</b> But thieves don't know that.
<b>A:</b> They might think that I've got an iPod or laptop in there.
<b>B:</b> Now you're thinking.
<b>A:</b> You'd think a library would be safe from thieves.
<b>B:</b> Not even a church is safe from thieves.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-204"><b>A:</b> How good is your math?</span>
<b>B:</b> I can add two and two.
<b>A:</b> So you're not very good at math?
<b>B:</b> I'm terrible at math.
<b>A:</b> Well, I need some help.
<b>B:</b> With what?
<b>A:</b> I'm taking a math course in school.
<b>B:</b> Well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.
<b>A:</b> I can't do that.
<b>B:</b> Why not?
<b>A:</b> They might think I'm stupid.
<b>B:</b> They're not going to think that! They'll be glad to help you.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-205"><b>A:</b> Do you believe in God?</span>
<b>B:</b> Of course.
<b>A:</b> Do you pray to God?
<b>B:</b> Occasionally.
<b>A:</b> When's that?

<b>A:</b> Like what?
<b>B:</b> Well, if I have a big test at school.
<b>A:</b> Does God answer your prayers?
<b>B:</b> Yes, I've passed all my tests.

<b>A:</b> The husband said he tried to help the boy.
<b>B:</b> Yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car.
<b>A:</b> No, he said he gently placed the boy on the street.
<b>B:</b> So what? They still drove off.
<b>A:</b> The husband said a fire department was nearby.
<b>B:</b> So what? Did he dial 911?
<b>A:</b> He said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it.
<b>B:</b> He didn't get around to turning himself in, either.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-207"><b>A:</b> I like that shirt.</span>
<b>B:</b> So do I.
<b>A:</b> How much is it?
<b>B:</b> I don't know. The tag is missing.
<b>A:</b> Ask the clerk.
<b>B:</b> I will.
<b>A:</b> Oh, look. Here's another shirt just like it.
<b>B:</b> Does it have a price tag?
<b>A:</b> Yes, it does. It's only $20.
<b>B:</b> That's a great price.
<b>A:</b> I think I'll buy both of them.
<b>B:</b> You'd better try them on first.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-208"><b>A:</b> I bought you a pair of pants.</span>
<b>B:</b> Thank you.
<b>A:</b> I hope they fit.
<b>B:</b> I hope you kept the receipt.
<b>A:</b> You think they won't fit?
<b>B:</b> I think I've put on some weight.
<b>A:</b> You think?
<b>B:</b> Maybe a pound or two.
<b>A:</b> Maybe four or five pounds?
<b>B:</b> My waist is bigger than it was.
<b>A:</b> No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.
<b>B:</b> You are so smart!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-209"><b>A:</b> What do we need to buy?</span>
<b>B:</b> Let me look at our list.
<b>A:</b> I know that we need milk.
<b>B:</b> Nonfat.
<b>A:</b> Of course. What else?
<b>B:</b> We need cheese, bread, and ham.
<b>A:</b> What kind of cheese?
<b>B:</b> Swiss.
<b>A:</b> Of course, the cheese with holes in it.
<b>B:</b> I never used to buy Swiss cheese.
<b>A:</b> Why not?
<b>B:</b> I didn't want to pay for the holes.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-210"><b>A:</b> I need some pants.</span>
<b>B:</b> I thought you just bought a pair.
<b>A:</b> I did.
<b>B:</b> What's wrong with them so soon?
<b>A:</b> The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
<b>B:</b> You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
<b>A:</b> But that's what pockets are for.
<b>B:</b> You should carry them in a purse.
<b>A:</b> I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
<b>B:</b> Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
<b>A:</b> I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
<b>B:</b> Try a Google search online.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-211"><b>A:</b> What are those wipes for?</span>
<b>B:</b> You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
<b>A:</b> That's a great idea.
<b>B:</b> Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
<b>A:</b> I'm going to take five wipes.
<b>B:</b> What do you need five of them for?
<b>A:</b> One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
<b>B:</b> What's the matter with the produce?
<b>A:</b> Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
<b>B:</b> What do you mean?
<b>A:</b> I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.
<b>B:</b> Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-212"><b>A:</b> Did you go to the 99 Cents store?</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, I did.
<b>A:</b> What did you buy?
<b>B:</b> Well, I got a lot of good deals, as usual.
<b>A:</b> Like what?
<b>B:</b> Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
<b>A:</b> That's a good deal.
<b>B:</b> And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
<b>A:</b> Another good deal.
<b>B:</b> But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
<b>A:</b> I don't know how that store makes money.
<b>B:</b> Neither do I, but they're doing something right.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-213"><b>A:</b> I need a new computer.</span>
<b>B:</b> What's the matter with yours?
<b>A:</b> It's six years old.
<b>B:</b> That's pretty old.
<b>A:</b> It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.
<b>B:</b> Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
<b>A:</b> Oh, a laptop, of course.
<b>B:</b> A PC or a Mac?
<b>A:</b> I haven't decided yet.
<b>B:</b> More and more people are using Macs.
<b>A:</b> But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.
<b>B:</b> And that's not going to change anytime soon.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-214"><b>A:</b> I got ripped off.</span>
<b>B:</b> What happened?
<b>A:</b> I had a car problem, so I went online.
<b>B:</b> Did you find a solution?
<b>A:</b> Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.
<b>B:</b> So, what's the problem?
<b>A:</b> I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
<b>B:</b> What are you going to do?
<b>A:</b> I sent them an email asking for my money back.
<b>B:</b> Have you heard from them?
<b>A:</b> Not yet. It's been a week.
<b>B:</b> Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-215"><b>A:</b> Where's the pencil sharpener?</span>
<b>B:</b> Which one?
<b>A:</b> Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.
<b>B:</b> I think there's one on the dining room table.
<b>A:</b> I already looked there.
<b>B:</b> Did you look in the desk drawer?
<b>A:</b> Yes, I looked there, too.
<b>B:</b> Don't we have about five sharpeners?
<b>A:</b> Yes, but they seem to have legs.
<b>B:</b> Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
<b>A:</b> Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
<b>B:</b> Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-216"><b>A:</b> I'm trying to stretch my dollars.</span>
<b>B:</b> How are you doing that?
<b>A:</b> I started shopping at the dollar store.
<b>B:</b> That saves a lot of money.
<b>A:</b> I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
<b>B:</b> That's a good deal.
<b>A:</b> Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
<b>B:</b> Just put them in the fridge.
<b>A:</b> Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
<b>B:</b> Why did you do that?
<b>A:</b> I mixed them together.
<b>B:</b> If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-217"><b>A:</b> Can we go to the baseball game?</span>
<b>B:</b> Of course.
<b>A:</b> I love baseball.
<b>B:</b> So do I.
<b>A:</b> I love to eat the peanuts.
<b>B:</b> I love to eat the hot dogs.
<b>A:</b> I hope we�ll see a home run.
<b>B:</b> I hope we�ll catch a foul ball.
<b>A:</b> Bring a jacket.
<b>B:</b> Yes. It gets a little cool at night.
<b>A:</b> Bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
<b>B:</b> No. I�ll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-218"><b>A:</b> Golf is a silly game.</span>
<b>B:</b> It certainly is.
<b>A:</b> You hit a white ball.
<b>B:</b> And then you chase it.
<b>A:</b> And then you hit it again.
<b>B:</b> Finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
<b>A:</b> You do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes. 
<b>B:</b> What�s the point?
<b>A:</b> How can it be fun?
<b>B:</b> They pay money to play this silly game!
<b>A:</b> I think golfers have a mental problem.
<b>B:</b> I think they�re nuts.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-219"><b>A:</b> Do you want to go fishing?</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes. That�s a good idea.
<b>A:</b> Where do you want to go?
<b>B:</b> We can go to the river.
<b>A:</b> Or we can go to the lake.
<b>B:</b> Or we can go to the ocean.
<b>A:</b> Let�s go to the lake.
<b>B:</b> Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.
<b>A:</b> We can be there in 20 minutes.
<b>B:</b> I�ll get our fishing rods.
<b>A:</b> I�ll get the bait.
<b>B:</b> We�ll have fresh fish for dinner!

<span class="topic" id="chapter-220"><b>A:</b> Baseball is fun.</span>
<b>B:</b> I like to hit the ball.
<b>A:</b> I like to run around the bases.
<b>B:</b> I like to slide into the bases.
<b>A:</b> Yeah. It�s a lot of fun to slide.
<b>B:</b> I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
<b>A:</b> Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
<b>B:</b> Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
<b>A:</b> We have to practice every day.
<b>B:</b> I don�t like practice.
<b>A:</b> Me neither. It�s boring.
<b>B:</b> But practice makes perfect.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-221"><b>A:</b> Let�s go jogging.</span>
<b>B:</b> That�s a good idea.
<b>A:</b> I bought some new shoes.
<b>B:</b> Are they comfortable?
<b>A:</b> They�re very comfortable.
<b>B:</b> How much were they?
<b>A:</b> They were on sale for $80.
<b>B:</b> Do they help you run faster?
<b>A:</b> No, but my feet don�t hurt anymore.
<b>B:</b> Then they�re worth every penny.
<b>A:</b> You might want to buy a pair.
<b>B:</b> I�ll wait until I wear this pair out.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-222"><b>A:</b> Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.</span>
<b>B:</b> You can say that again.
<b>A:</b> But I�m worried about Tiger.
<b>B:</b> Why is that?
<b>A:</b> Because he likes to SCUBA dive.
<b>B:</b> What�s wrong with that?
<b>A:</b> It can be dangerous.
<b>B:</b> You mean he could drown.
<b>A:</b> He shouldn�t SCUBA dive until he retires.
<b>B:</b> But he dives to relax.
<b>A:</b> He might relax, but it makes me nervous.
<b>B:</b> If his wife doesn�t mind, you shouldn�t mind.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-223"><b>A:</b> Did you watch that golf tournament?</span>
<b>B:</b> The one that Tiger won?
<b>A:</b> How did he do it?
<b>B:</b> It was nothing for him.
<b>A:</b> He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
<b>B:</b> He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
<b>A:</b> I think he is from outer space.
<b>B:</b> No human could possibly play golf that well.
<b>A:</b> Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
<b>B:</b> No human can do that.
<b>A:</b> Somebody should check his birth record.
<b>B:</b> I bet it says he was born on Mars.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-224"><b>A:</b> Who�s the greatest baseball player?</span>
<b>B:</b> There are so many great players.
<b>A:</b> Yes, but who is the greatest?
<b>B:</b> I�d have to say Babe Ruth.
<b>A:</b> Most people would say that.
<b>B:</b> He changed the game.
<b>A:</b> Yes, he made the home run popular.
<b>B:</b> Everybody loved him, all over the nation.
<b>A:</b> He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.
<b>B:</b> And Ruth was a good person, too.
<b>A:</b> He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
<b>B:</b> There will never be another Babe.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-225"><b>A:</b> Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?</span>
<b>B:</b> No, please tell me.
<b>A:</b> Someone punched out someone.
<b>B:</b> That�s not nice.
<b>A:</b> It�s worse than that.
<b>B:</b> How so?
<b>A:</b> Two guys got into an argument.
<b>B:</b> I�ll bet they were drinking.
<b>A:</b> A third guy punched one of the two guys.
<b>B:</b> I�ll bet he was drinking, too.
<b>A:</b> The victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
<b>B:</b> That�s terrible. Can�t people just have fun at a baseball game?

<span class="topic" id="chapter-226"><b>A:</b> I want to go to the ball game.</span>

<b>A:</b> Yes, it starts at 7 p.m.
<b>B:</b> Can we get tickets?
<b>A:</b> Yes, but only the cheap tickets.
<b>B:</b> How much are they?
<b>A:</b> They�re only $5 each.
<b>B:</b> That�s a good price.
<b>A:</b> Yes, it�s cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
<b>B:</b> Where are the seats?
<b>A:</b> They�re behind the outfield.
<b>B:</b> Maybe we can catch a home run ball.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-227"><b>A:</b> Golf is so hard.</span>
<b>B:</b> What's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
<b>A:</b> It's hard if you want to do it right.
<b>B:</b> You mean like Tiger?
<b>A:</b> No, like a good amateur golfer.
<b>B:</b> What's so hard about golf?
<b>A:</b> There are so many things you have to do right.
<b>B:</b> Like what?
<b>A:</b> Like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
<b>B:</b> Yikes! Who can remember all that?
<b>A:</b> You need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
<b>B:</b> Forget it. Golf sounds more like work than fun.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-228"><b>A:</b> Did you hear about the ball player?</span>
<b>B:</b> The home run hitter on drugs?
<b>A:</b> He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
<b>B:</b> He said he wasn�t using drugs.
<b>A:</b> He apologized to the fans.
<b>B:</b> The league suspended him for 50 games.
<b>A:</b> That will cost him some money.
<b>B:</b> Yes, about $7 million.
<b>A:</b> That will teach him a good lesson.
<b>B:</b> He probably won�t use drugs anymore.
<b>A:</b> But it won�t stop other players from using drugs.
<b>B:</b> No. Everyone always figures that they won�t get caught.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-229"><b>A:</b> I don't like riding the bus.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why not?
<b>A:</b> The seats and windows are dirty.
<b>B:</b> Don't they clean the bus every night?
<b>A:</b> I think they do.
<b>B:</b> You should bring some wipes with you.
<b>A:</b> That's a good idea.
<b>B:</b> Then you can wipe your seat and window.
<b>A:</b> People will think I'm strange.
<b>B:</b> Who cares? Everyone is strange.
<b>A:</b> That's for sure.
<b>B:</b> Don't worry about what people think.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-230"><b>A:</b> I don't like riding the bus.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why not?
<b>A:</b> Number one, it's too slow.
<b>B:</b> You're right. A car is faster.
<b>A:</b> Number two, it's usually late.
<b>B:</b> You're right. The buses are never on time.
<b>A:</b> Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.
<b>B:</b> You're right. Buses don't run late at night.
<b>A:</b> Number four, it's too crowded.
<b>B:</b> You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.
<b>A:</b> Number five, it's unsafe.
<b>B:</b> You're right. Bad guys might rob you.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-231"><b>A:</b> We had a problem at school.</span>

<b>A:</b> They were in the student parking lot.
<b>B:</b> How many tires were cut?
<b>A:</b> One or two tires were cut on each car.

<b>A:</b> Yes, but the red hand was blinking.
<b>B:</b> So? That's a ticket?
<b>A:</b> Yes, it's a $140 ticket.
<b>B:</b> That's not right!
<b>A:</b> When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
<b>B:</b> You need to walk faster.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-233"><b>A:</b> You're driving too fast.</span>
<b>B:</b> Why do you say that?
<b>A:</b> The speed limit is 65.
<b>B:</b> I know that.
<b>A:</b> But you're doing 75.
<b>B:</b> So is everyone else.
<b>A:</b> But a cop might stop you.
<b>B:</b> No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.
<b>A:</b> So the cop will stop those cars?
<b>B:</b> Of course. He stops the fastest cars.
<b>A:</b> My friend got a ticket for doing 75.
<b>B:</b> Your friend was unlucky.


<span class="topic" id="chapter-234"><b>A:</b> Remember to put air in your tires.</span>
<b>B:</b> How often do I have to do that?
<b>A:</b> Once every two months.
<b>B:</b> That's a lot.
<b>A:</b> What do you mean?
<b>B:</b> That's six times a year!
<b>A:</b> Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.
<b>B:</b> I'll try.
<b>A:</b> Check your tires or you'll get a flat.
<b>B:</b> Oh. That's not good.

<b>A:</b> That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.
<b>B:</b> Well, I meant to.
<b>A:</b> Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
<b>B:</b> Why not?
<b>A:</b> Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
<b>B:</b> How do you know that?
<b>A:</b> I read a lot.
<b>B:</b> I thought drunks caused most accidents.

<b>B:</b> No, the police don't care.

<b>B:</b> They have to see it happen.
<b>A:</b> They don't believe us?
<b>B:</b> No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen.

<b>B:</b> We don't do anything.

<b>A:</b> Of course. It's not a hard job.
<b>B:</b> I'll help you.
<b>A:</b> Okay, I'll get a bucket.
<b>B:</b> I'll rinse the car first.
<b>A:</b> Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.

<b>A:</b> No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.

<b>B:</b> Especially the metal ones.
<b>A:</b> I don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
<b>B:</b> That's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.
<b>A:</b> Did you save any money on the sale?
<b>B:</b> Yes, I did. I saved about $50.

<b>B:</b> Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.
<b>A:</b> But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.

that maybe 20 percent would be appropriate.

if you would take a look at it for me to see if it has any problems.
<b>B:</b> Sure, pull up over there and we'll take a look.
<b>A:</b> I just wasn't sure what to look for.
<b>B:</b> The first thing you do is look for any signs of wear both inside and out. We 
will also look at the body for signs of major repair.
<b>A:</b> Someone told me that I could go online and see if the car is listed as having 
been in a major accident.
<b>B:</b> Yes, that's right. Next, we will turn on the engine and I will check under 
the hood to look at the hoses and belts.
<b>A:</b> Should we take the car for a drive?
<b>B:</b> Yes, but before we pull away, let's check to make sure that the radio, turn 
signals, lights, and seats all work properly.
<b>A:</b> As I am driving what should I be checking?
<b>B:</b> You want to make sure that the brakes don't pull to one side and that the car 
has good alignment and acceleration.

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1182"><b>A:</b> I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing </span>
it.
<b>B:</b> I can help you. Do you have a down payment?
<b>A:</b> Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.
<b>B:</b> Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money 
down on the car.
<b>A:</b> I don't know where exactly to get a loan.
<b>B:</b> Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the 
dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.
<b>A:</b> What is the best choice for financing?
<b>B:</b> It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will 
oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.
<b>A:</b> What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
<b>B:</b> You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. 
Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good 
luck!

in person. Sometimes you can take care of your business at the Automobile Club 
or at the DMV website.
<b>A:</b> If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?
<b>B:</b> You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone 
number listed on their website.
<b>A:</b> What if I just show up there?
<b>B:</b> If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you.
<b>A:</b> Is the DMV open on Saturdays?
<b>B:</b> Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
<b>A:</b> I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club!

<b>A:</b> Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car.
<b>B:</b> I might be able to come down a little on the price.
<b>A:</b> How about selling the car for four thousand?

car go for fifteen thousand dollars.
<b>A:</b> I was thinking a little lower than that.
<b>B:</b> Whoa! Let's keep talking here. I am sure we can work something out. What 
price are you thinking is fair?
<b>A:</b> I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars.
<b>B:</b> You know, you look like you are a sweet kid. I'll give it to you for fourteen 
thousand dollars.
<b>A:</b> That would be a good price if the car was in great shape, but it is

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1200"><b>A:</b> Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?</span>
<b>B:</b> Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website.
<b>A:</b> Basically, what will I need to do?
<b>B:</b> Both buyer and seller need to transfer the ownership by filling out a Change 
of Ownership form and signing over the Certificate of Title, which will be either pink or rainbow. 
<b>A:</b> Will I have to pay any fees?
<b>B:</b> All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer.
<b>A:</b> How much will it cost to transfer the title?
<b>B:</b> The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you.
<b>A:</b> Do I need a Smog Certificate?
<b>B:</b> No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975.
<b>A:</b> Where do I take my forms?
<b>B:</b> You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process.

<b>B:</b> I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but 
actually you have many options.

<b>B:</b> You could look on the Internet. Craigslist is best, as most of the cars 
listed there are sold locally.
<b>A:</b> What would be best if I wanted to actually go see a lot of used cars that are 
for sale?
<b>B:</b> The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot.
<b>A:</b> Where is CarMax?
<b>B:</b> There are many of them. You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for 
the one closest to you.
<b>A:</b> How about the listings on the college bulletin board?

<h2 id="chapter-1285"><b>6. Getting a Passport</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1286"><b>A:</b> I need to get a passport.</span>
<b>B:</b> The first thing you need to do is go to the post office and get an 
application.
<b>A:</b> After I fill it out, where do I take it?
<b>B:</b> You need to take your application to a specially designated post office.

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1289"><b>A:</b> I don't know how much luggage I can take on the plane with me.</span>
<b>B:</b> You need to look up each individual airline online to get their 
restrictions.
<b>A:</b> I just wonder what the general rules are.
<b>B:</b> In the United States, if you fly economy on a domestic flight, you 
usually have to pay for checked baggage.
<b>A:</b> What about international flights?
<b>B:</b> On international flights, you usually have a two-bag limit with weight 
restrictions.
<b>A:</b> What about carry-on bags?
<b>B:</b> All airlines will allow you to bring one small carry-on that will fit 
under the seat. Sometimes you can also bring a purse or handbag. 
<b>A:</b> Do you have any words of wisdom for travelers in regard to luggage?
<b>B:</b> Keep it light in regard to what you pack. Figure out what you absolutely 
need and leave the rest at home.




<h2 id="chapter-1291"><b>8. Carry-on Luggage</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1292"><b>A:</b> I haven't traveled much and need to know what I can carry in my luggage.</span>
<b>B:</b> There are different considerations. You have to consider airline rules 
and rules for customs.
<b>A:</b> How do I find out about each country's Customs regulations?
<b>B:</b> You can go to a website for the particular country you are interested in.
<b>A:</b> Is there anything that I should keep in mind for all countries?
<b>B:</b> Do not ever lie about what you are carrying in your luggage. If you get 
caught, there is a major fine just for lying.
<b>A:</b> How about regulations for what you can carry on an airline?
<b>B:</b> The Internet is a good source for special regulations for particular 
airports and airlines.
<b>A:</b> I heard that I can't bring my own bottled water on the plane.
<b>B:</b> You can buy water at the airport once you pass luggage inspection.




<h2 id="chapter-1294"><b>9. Dropping Off at the Airport</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1295"><b>A:</b> Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow afternoon?</span>
<b>B:</b> I would be happy to drive you to the airport. When do you need to leave?
<b>A:</b> For an international flight, the airline wants us to check in two hours 
in advance, so I need to leave my house at 2:00.
<b>B:</b> Do you have a lot of luggage to check in?
<b>A:</b> I am only carrying one large bag and a carry-on.
<b>B:</b> I'll bring our smaller car then. Do you know where you need to get 
dropped off?
<b>A:</b> Yes, I am flying out on Singapore Air to Sydney, so I need to be at the 
International Terminal.
<b>B:</b> Will I be able to come in with you to say goodbye?
<b>A:</b> Actually, with airport regulations being so strict, you should probably 
just drop me off at the curb.
<b>B:</b> That will work out fine. Just give me a call if anything changes.




<h2 id="chapter-1297"><b>10. Picking Up at the Airport</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1298"><b>A:</b> Would you be able to pick me up at the airport next Sunday?</span>
<b>B:</b> Sure, I would be happy to help you. What time are you arriving?
<b>A:</b> I will be arriving at 3:00 in the afternoon.
<b>B:</b> By the time you pick up your luggage, it will be around 3:30. What if I 
meet you outside at the curb?
<b>A:</b> That would be a good time to meet, but what if I am running late?
<b>B:</b> I can track your plane online. I can just put in the flight number and I 
can see if you are on time.
<b>A:</b> Can you make sure that you have your cell phone with you so I can call 
you?
<b>B:</b> Yes, that would be good idea.
<b>A:</b> If something happens and you can't make it, just let me know and I'll 
book a Super Shuttle.
<b>B:</b> Don't worry. I'll be able to pick you up.




<h2 id="chapter-1300"><b>11. Going through the Customs</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1301"><b>A:</b> Could you tell me how to get my bags?</span>

directing you.
<b>A:</b> Where do we clear Customs?
<b>B:</b> You will pick your bags up first.
<b>A:</b> Should we have our passports out?
<b>B:</b> You should have your passport out and your Declarations form totally 
filled out before you get into line.
<b>A:</b> My friend here is continuing on to Puerto Rico, and we were wondering if 
she has to go through Customs.
<b>B:</b> Travelers who are continuing on to another country will check in over 
there and be directed where to go next. Their bags have been checked 
through.
<b>A:</b> Are there any restrooms in this area?
<b>B:</b> Yes, right over there after you pass through the line.

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1304"><b>A:</b> Can you help me figure out where I should go first to check in at this </span>
airport?
<b>B:</b> If you already have your ticket, we can take your bags here at the 
curbside check-in.
<b>A:</b> How do I know what gate to go to?
<b>B:</b> There are arrivals and departures listed on the screens inside.
<b>A:</b> Is there someplace where I can find out what I can carry in my baggage?
<b>B:</b> There are signs posted near the baggage check area to help you know what 
the rules are.
<b>A:</b> Can my friend go inside with me?
<b>B:</b> Your friend can go with you to the ticket counter but not past the 
security check.
<b>A:</b> When I return, will this curbside area be a good place to get picked up?
<b>B:</b> This area is only for departures. The bottom level is for arrivals.

<b>B:</b> I would be happy to help you clarify anything you need help with.
<b>A:</b> Could you help me find out where my nearest exit is?
<b>B:</b> There is a card in your seat pocket that shows you where your nearest 
exit is. Yours is two rows in front of you.
<b>A:</b> Where is my oxygen mask that you were talking about?
<b>B:</b> Your oxygen mask is above you, next to the reading light. It will drop 
down when you need it.
<b>A:</b> I am concerned about landing in the water.
<b>B:</b> The life jackets are under your seat. You can also use your seat cushion 
as a flotation device.
<b>A:</b> What is the most important thing we can do to stay safe?
<b>B:</b> The most important thing you can do is keep your seatbelt fastened when 
the captain asks you to.




<h2 id="chapter-1309"><b>14. Talking to a Seatmate</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1310"><b>A:</b> That rain is really coming down out there!</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, it's kind of crazy weather outside.
<b>A:</b> I get kind of nervous flying in this kind of weather.
<b>B:</b> I don't think anyone feels all that comfortable flying in a storm.
<b>A:</b> Do you think it will be this bad the whole trip?
<b>B:</b> On the weather channel, this storm looked to be a big one. It will 
probably be with us for a while.
<b>A:</b> I worry about too much ice on the wings.
<b>B:</b> I have to believe that our pilot knows what he is doing and we'll be 
okay.
<b>A:</b> When do you think the pilot will turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign?
<b>B:</b> He'll turn it off as soon as he knows that we are through the turbulence.
<b>A:</b> Do you think that we are going to crash?
<b>B:</b> Maybe. You just never know.




<h2 id="chapter-1312"><b>15. Ordering Food and Drink</b></h2>

<b>B:</b> Our alcoholic beverages are five dollars each. All others are 
complimentary.
<b>A:</b> When will our meals be served?
<b>B:</b> We will serve a snack with the beverages. Dinner will be served a few 
hours into our flight.
<b>A:</b> What are our dinner choices?
<b>B:</b> You will have a choice of chicken, fish, or beef. I will be bringing a 
menu by shortly.
<b>A:</b> I am a vegetarian and need a vegetarian meal.
<b>B:</b> Vegetarian meals need to be requested at least two days before your 
flight. I might be able to find you extra servings of vegetables, however.

 <span class="topic" id="chapter-1316"></span>
<b>A:</b> My flight just arrived late, and I need to know what to do.
<b>B:</b> That's okay. The airline computer is keeping track of what is happening 
with you.
<b>A:</b> Do I have to call anyone?
<b>B:</b> By speaking with us at the arrival gate, we can fix the problem for you 
and direct you.
<b>A:</b> What if there are no more connecting flights for today on this airline?
<b>B:</b> We will go online to see if there is something available with this 
airline. If we need to, we can check for a flight with another carrier.
<b>A:</b> What if I can't find another flight out of here tonight?
<b>B:</b> We can help you find transportation to a local hotel.
<b>A:</b> Will the airline pay for my room if I have to spend the night at the 
airport?
<b>B:</b> Since the flight delay was our fault and you are continuing on with our 
airline, we will cover the cost of a hotel room.




<h2 id="chapter-1318"><b>17. Ground Transportation</b></h2>


<span class="topic" id="chapter-1319"><b>A:</b> I just arrived and need help getting transportation to my hotel.</span>
<b>B:</b> There are shuttles, taxis, and buses that go all over the city.
<b>A:</b> Which one is the best form of transportation?
<b>B:</b> It depends on where you want to go. If you are going to a well-known 
hotel, they have their own shuttles that drop you right off at the door.
<b>A:</b> Where can I catch a cab?
<b>B:</b> All ground transportation leaves from the island as you walk out the 
arrivals gate.
<b>A:</b> Where can I rent a car?
<b>B:</b> The car rental agencies are against the wall as you exit.
<b>A:</b> Are there any subways in this town?
<b>B:</b> We have a subway system, but you need to take a shuttle to get to the 
station.

here?

<b>A:</b> This is my first time visiting this city.
<b>B:</b> What are you interested in? Do you enjoy museums and buildings, or would

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1325"><b>A:</b> I am having some big problems on this tour.</span>
<b>B:</b> What seems to be the problem? We are here to help you.
<b>A:</b> This tour company seems very disorganized. No one seems to have a clear 
picture as to where we are going and when we are going to get there.
<b>B:</b> I will see what I can do about that. How about the accommodations on the 
tour?
<b>A:</b> So far, we have been staying in really out-of-the-way accommodations.
<b>B:</b> Is anything wrong with your room?
<b>A:</b> The television in our room was broken, and they didn't send anyone to fix 
it.
<b>B:</b> I will complain to the hotel manager about that. How about the hotel 
restaurant?
<b>A:</b> The food in the restaurant was terrible, and a few people from our group 
got sick.

you a free city tour and lunch to make it up to you.

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1328"><b>A:</b> Where should we go sightseeing today?</span>
<b>B:</b> I think that some things might be best done in the morning and others in 
the afternoon.
<b>A:</b> I think that I would like to go to the beach this morning.
<b>B:</b> That would be a good place to start our sightseeing. We could have 
breakfast there.
<b>A:</b> I hear that there is a very nice natural history museum there.
<b>B:</b> Yes, it would be nice to check that out since we are so close by.
<b>A:</b> Where should we go in the afternoon?
<b>B:</b> I think that I would like to go to the amusement park. It's supposed to 
be quite good.
<b>A:</b> At the end of the day, I would love to take in the sunset at the 
restaurant by the park.
<b>B:</b> That sounds like a great idea! Let's go get a map.

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1331"><b>A:</b> I guess that we won't be going rollerblading today with all this rain!</span>
<b>B:</b> Yes, rollerblading in six inches of water would not be fun. What would 
you like to do instead?
<b>A:</b> I think that maybe we could check out the local mall, grab some lunch, 
and maybe see a movie.
<b>B:</b> Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and 
still stay dry.
<b>A:</b> What else could we do in bad weather?
<b>B:</b> You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses 
and buildings.
<b>A:</b> That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere.
<b>B:</b> There is an old English pub next door. Maybe when we finish with the 
haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.
<b>A:</b> What a great idea!
<b>B:</b> If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for 
supper.

<b>A:</b> I usually buy myself some jewelry or some clothing.
<b>B:</b> I always buy a lot of things for my family. How about you?
<b>A:</b> Yes, they practically swarm me when I get home!
<b>B:</b> What are some of their favorite gifts?
<b>A:</b> The teenagers like me to bring them tee shirts that you can't get 
anywhere else.
<b>B:</b> This stuff is pretty expensive, isn't it?
<b>A:</b> Souvenirs cost a lot for what they are, but we can shop around for better 
prices.

<b>A:</b> I think that we should maybe check into how to find a doctor in this 
country.

quite good.

<b>A:</b> It contained my wallet and passport.
<b>B:</b> How much money was in your wallet?
<b>A:</b> There was about $200 in my wallet, and I had some traveler's checks in 
there, too.
<b>B:</b> We can call American Express to deal with the traveler's checks. How 
about credit cards?
<b>A:</b> I had a MasterCard and a Visa Card.
<b>B:</b> We can look at the back of my cards to get the emergency phone numbers.
<b>A:</b> Where do I report that my passport is missing?

<span class="topic" id="chapter-1343"><b>A:</b> Is there anything special I need to think about as I tour this city?</span>
<b>B:</b> You need to keep in mind that this is a very poor country. Things are a 
little more desperate here than you are used to.
<b>A:</b> What do I need to look for?
<b>B:</b> Be particularly vigilant anytime you are in a crowded place with other 
tourists. Pickpockets know that tourists aren't paying all that much 
attention.
<b>A:</b> I have seen many children on the street begging, so what do I do about 
them?
<b>B:</b> It is best not to give money to children or other beggars on the street, 
as they can swarm you. You can give money to a local charity.
<b>A:</b> Should I be concerned about what I eat or drink?
<b>B:</b> Do not drink any water that isn't bottled. Avoid street vendor food.
<b>A:</b> How about being out on the street at night?
<b>B:</b> I would take a cab to your destination at night. Don't walk down the 
street alone.

meditate.

van. I am the driver for Glendale, but your van should be along in a minute.
<b>A:</b> Do you know how much it costs to get to Pasadena?
<b>B:</b> I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.
<b>A:</b> Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a 
lot of stops?
<b>B:</b> Before you pay the driver, you need to ask him. He needs to be upfront 
with you about the number of stops he will be making.
<b>A:</b> Do I need to have exact change?
<b>B:</b> You don't need exact change, but it is useful to have smaller bills.
