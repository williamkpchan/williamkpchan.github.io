<b>B:</b> What race is he?<br>
<b>A:</b> They didn't say.<br>
<b>B:</b> The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.<br>
<b>A:</b> Of course not. That would be racist.<br>
<b>B:</b> But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?<br>
<b>A:</b> Don't ask me.<br>
<b>B:</b> Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.<br>

<b>A:</b> The artist said the jar was both full and empty.<br>
<b>B:</b> But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?<br>

<b>B:</b> Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?<br>
<b>A:</b> Of course! He's world famous.<br>
<b>B:</b> Did he ever take art lessons?<br>

<b>A:</b> Then why aren't I having fun?<br>
<b>B:</b> Because you're thinking too much.<br>
<b>A:</b> So I should stop thinking?<br>
<b>B:</b> Stop thinking about what the point is.<br>
<b>A:</b> Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.<br>

<b>B:</b> I could pick only one or the other?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.<br>
<b>B:</b> Boy, that's a tough one.<br>
<b>A:</b> What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.<br>

<b>A:</b> Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?<br>
<b>B:</b> Criminals, of course.<br>
<b>A:</b> Anyway, I have to fix the hole.<br>
<b>B:</b> You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.<br>
<b>A:</b> Tell me about this patch.<br>
<b>B:</b> The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.<br>
<b>A:</b> That sounds a lot easier than sewing.<br>
<b>B:</b> It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.<br>

<b>B:</b> What's that?<br>
<b>A:</b> It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.<br>
<b>B:</b> Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.<br>
<b>B:</b> How about if I take shorter showers?<br>
<b>A:</b> That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.<br>
<b>B:</b> From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.<br>

<b>A:</b> Some of it is okay, I guess.<br>
<b>B:</b> Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.<br>
<b>A:</b> Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."<br>
<b>B:</b> But people still write poems.<br>
<b>A:</b> No one makes any money at it.<br>
<b>B:</b> Shakespeare was a poet.<br>
<b>A:</b> Did he get rich from his poetry?<br>
<b>B:</b> Probably not.<br>
<b>A:</b> Poems are a little bit like songs.<br>
<b>B:</b> Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.<br>

<b>B:</b> If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.<br>
<b>A:</b> Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?<br>
<b>B:</b> It must be very lonely.<br>

<b>A:</b> Are you going to be buried next to each other?<br>
<b>B:</b> Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.<br>
<b>A:</b> You're not going to be buried?<br>
<b>B:</b> A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.<br>
<b>B:</b> Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.<br>
<b>A:</b> That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.<br>

<b>B:</b> That's a good deal.<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.<br>
<b>B:</b> Just put them in the fridge.<br>

<b>B:</b> What�s wrong with that?<br>
<b>A:</b> It can be dangerous.<br>
<b>B:</b> You mean he could drown.<br>

<b>B:</b> He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.<br>
<b>A:</b> I think he is from outer space.<br>

<b>B:</b> The league suspended him for 50 games.<br>

<span class="topic" id="chapter-275"><b>A:</b> Have you decided how you are going to vote?<br></span>
<b>B:</b> Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.<br>
<b>B:</b> You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.<br>
<b>A:</b> But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.<br>
<b>B:</b> Do you believe the TV ads?<br>
<b>A:</b> I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.<br>
<b>B:</b> Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.<br>
<b>A:</b> But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."<br>
<b>B:</b> The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."<br>
<b>A:</b> I can't believe that they would lie to us.<br>
<b>B:</b> Of course they lie�that's what politicians do!

the hood to look at the hoses and belts.<br>

it.<br>
<b>B:</b> I can help you. Do you have a down payment?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.<br>
<b>B:</b> Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money 
down on the car.<br>
<b>A:</b> I don't know where exactly to get a loan.<br>
<b>B:</b> Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the 
dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.<br>
<b>A:</b> What is the best choice for financing?<br>
<b>B:</b> It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will 
oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.<br>
<b>A:</b> What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?<br>
<b>B:</b> You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. 
Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good

<b>A:</b> Do I need a Smog Certificate?<br>
<b>B:</b> No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975.<br>

for sale?<br>
