What’s the difference between a video conferencing app like <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> or <a href="https://www.webex.com/">WebEx</a> and actual virtual classroom software as we discuss below?
Well, you can find a really great breakdown on the <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/">eLearning Industry</a> article <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/virtual-classrooms-vs-web-conferencing">Virtual Classrooms vs. Web Conferencing</a>. 
It comes down to purpose. 
Why do these solutions exist? In web conferencing apps, you can connect from anywhere with your webcam and share your screen. 
Is that a classroom? Is that the best way to engage your learners? Probably not. 
Web conferencing apps enable some basic things, but they do not offer the flexibility nor direction of purpose-built tools for online instruction like the best virtual classroom software.
When discussing the difference between video conferencing apps or virtual classroom software, I like to talk about cars. 
There are many different cars that are great for many different things. 
If I live in a city, then a subcompact car is perfect for running errands and fitting in parking spots, but if I’m commuting 2 hours each way, then I’d probably opt for a sedan. 
The point is you want to make sure you are investing in a solution that meets your specific needs.

<h2>How To Choose The Best Virtual Classroom Software?</h2>

Will you be teaching several students simultaneously or more one on one lessons?  Will you be providing courses for students or training with adults?  People in training and development use virtual classroom platforms a lot more nowadays.  Instructors in the K-12, higher learning and tutoring spaces have also stepped up their use of online learning platforms. 
So how do you choose the best virtual classroom software for your particular purpose?
Well, you’ll need to understand what is important to you, your facilitators or teachers, and your learners and students. 
The best way to do this is to first brainstorm with key stakeholders on what you really need to deliver an amazing learning experience. 
I suggest creating a list of features that you absolutely “must have” along with a list of features that are “nice to have”. 
You can then start comparing some of the virtual classroom software options you come across to see where they land. 

Once you narrow down your list, you can reach out to each company and try out their virtual classroom software for free. 
It’s incredibly important to testrun your preferred virtual classroom software before making a decision. 

To help you on your journey, we have compiled a list of the 7 best virtual classroom software solutions in 2019. 
The list isn’t scientific, but we took into account ease of use, pricing and features.

<h2>How to Get Started Teaching Online</h2>

<strong>Set Goals</strong><br>
The first thing you'll want to think about is what you're trying to achieve with this online course. 
Consider whether the entirety of the course will be on online teaching platforms, if it meant as a supplement to a course, or is meant as a prerequisite before joining a future course, e.g. 
an online course on basic math skills which might be required before taking an advanced live class, etc.

<strong>Create a Course Plan</strong><br>
Just like a face-to-face course, courses on online learning platforms need to have outlines or course plans for what you'll cover each week. 
If these are courses that you've previously offered live, you're one step ahead of the game. 
Your course plans will be your maps for what kinds of materials you will need to create for your lessons.

<strong>Gather Your Equipment</strong><br>
After you've considered what lessons you want to teach and what online learning platform you want to use, think about what types of equipment, software, and other tools you have at your disposal. 
Do you have a video camera or other device capable of capturing HD video? 
Do you have a screencasting software program? 
If not, sign up for a free trial of <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" target="_blank">Camtasia Studio</a>, or check out screencasting programs such as <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic</a> or <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html" target="_blank">Jing</a>. 
Will you need to create PowerPoints? 
Do you have a microphone to capture audio? 
Once you figure out what your technological capabilities and limitations are, you'll know what kinds of content you'll want to create.

<strong>Set Aside Time for Creation and Editing</strong><br>
If you're going to create videos and screencasts for your lessons, consider not only the time it takes to record these, but also how long it takes to edit them, create title slides, render and upload them to online teaching platforms, etc.

<strong>Get Started!</strong><br>
Once you've completed all of that planning, jump right in and start building your online course. 
It's really only through experimenting on online learning platforms that you'll know what you're doing wrong and what's working. 
Ask for feedback from your friends and social networks and get started teaching online!
