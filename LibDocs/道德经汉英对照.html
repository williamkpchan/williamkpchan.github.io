道德经Tao and Teh<br>
老子 著laozi　works<br>
林语堂 英译Lin Yutang translation<br>
<br>
-------<br>
一章<br>
<span class="remarks">道，可道，非恒道。</span><br>
名，可名，非恒名。<br>
无名，天地之始；<br>
有名，万物之母。<br>
故常无欲，以观其妙；<br>
常有欲，以观其徼。<br>
此两者同出而异名，同谓之玄。<br>
玄之又玄，众妙之门。<br>
<br>
The Tao that can be told of Is not the Absolute Tao;<br>
The Names that can be given Are not Absolute Names.<br>
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;<br>
The Named is the Mother of All Things.<br>
Therefore:<br>
Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion<br>
In order to see the Secret of Life;<br>
Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,<br>
In order to see its manifest forms.<br>
These two (the Secret and its manifestations)<br>
Are (in their nature) the same;<br>
They are given different names<br>
When they become manifest.<br>
They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery:<br>
Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery<br>
Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
二章<br>
<span class="remarks">天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已；</span><br>
皆知善之为善，斯不善矣。<br>
有无相生，难易相成，长短相形，高下相盈，音声相和，前后相随，恒也。<br>
是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教，万物作而弗始，生而弗有，为而弗恃，功成而弗居。<br>
夫唯弗居，是以不去。<br>
<br>
When the people of the Earth all know beauty as beauty,<br>
There arises (the recognition of) ugliness.<br>
When the people of the Earth all know the good as good,<br>
There arises (the recognition of) evil.<br>
Therefore:<br>
Being and non-being interdepend in growth;<br>
Difficult and easy interdepend in completion;<br>
Long and short interdepend in contrast;<br>
High and low interdepend in position;<br>
Tones and voice interdepend in harmony;<br>
Front and behind interdepend in company.<br>
Therefore the Sage:<br>
Manages affairs without action;<br>
Preaches the doctrine without words;<br>
All things take their rise, but he does not turn away from them;<br>
He gives them life, but does not take possession of them;<br>
He acts, but does not appropriate;<br>
Accomplishes, but claims no credit.<br>
It is because he lays claim to no credit<br>
That the credit cannot be taken away from him.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
三章<br>
<span class="remarks">不尚贤，使民不争；</span><br>
不贵难得之货，使民不为盗；<br>
不见可欲，使民心不乱。<br>
是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹；<br>
弱其志，强其骨。<br>
常使民无知无欲。<br>
使夫知不敢弗为而已，则无不治。<br>
<br>
Exalt not the wise,<br>
So that the people shall not scheme and contend;<br>
Prize not rare objects,<br>
So that the people shall not steal;<br>
Shut out from site the things of desire,<br>
So that the people's hearts shall not be disturbed.<br>
Therefore in the government of the Sage:<br>
He keeps empty their hearts<br>
Makes full their bellies,<br>
Discourages their ambitions,<br>
Strengthens their frames;<br>
So that the people may be innocent of knowledge and desires.<br>
And the cunning ones shall not presume to interfere.<br>
By action without deeds<br>
May all live in peace.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
四章<br>
<span class="remarks">道冲，而用之或不盈。</span><br>
渊兮，似万物之宗。<br>
挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。<br>
湛兮，似或存。<br>
吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。<br>
<br>
Tao is a hollow vessel,<br>
And its use is inexhaustible!<br>
Fathomless!<br>
Like the fountain head of all things,<br>
Its sharp edges rounded off,<br>
Its tangles untied,<br>
Its light tempered,<br>
Its turmoil submerged,<br>
Yet dark like deep water it seems to remain.<br>
I do not know whose Son it it,<br>
An image of what existed before God.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
五章<br>
<span class="remarks">天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；</span><br>
圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。<br>
天地之间，其犹橐龠乎？<br>
虚而不屈，动而愈出。<br>
多闻数穷，不如守中。<br>
<br>
Nature is unkind:<br>
It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs.<br>
The Sage is unkind:<br>
He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs.<br>
How the universe is like a bellows!<br>
Empty, yet it gives a supply that never fails;<br>
The more it is worked, the more it brings forth.<br>
By many words is wit exhausted.<br>
Rather, therefore, hold to the core.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
六章<br>
<span class="remarks">谷神不死，是谓玄牝。</span><br>
玄牝之门，是谓天地根。<br>
绵绵若存，用之不勤。<br>
<br>
The Spirit of the Valley never dies.<br>
It is called the Mystic Female.<br>
The Door of the Mystic Female<br>
Is the root of Heaven and Earth.<br>
Continuously, continuously,<br>
It seems to remain.<br>
Draw upon it<br>
And it serves you with ease.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七章<br>
<span class="remarks">天长地久。</span><br>
天地所以能长且久者，以其不自生，故能长生。<br>
是以圣人后其身而身先，外其身而身存。<br>
不以其无私邪？<br>
故能成其私。<br>
<br>
The universe is everlasting.<br>
The reason the universe is everlasting<br>
Is that it does not life for Self.<br>
Therefore it can long endure.<br>
Therefore the Sage puts himself last,<br>
And finds himself in the foremost place;<br>
Regards his body as accidental,<br>
And his body is thereby preserved.<br>
Is it not because he does not live for Self<br>
That his Self is realized?<br>
<br>
-------<br>
八章<br>
<span class="remarks">上善若水。</span><br>
水善利万物而不争，居众人之所恶，故几于道。<br>
居善地，心善渊，与善仁，言善信，政善治，事善能，动善时。<br>
夫唯不争，故无尤<br>
。<br>
<br>
The best of men is like water;<br>
Water benefits all things<br>
And does not compete with them.<br>
It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain -<br>
Wherein it comes near to the Tao.<br>
In his dwelling, (the Sage) loves the (lowly) earth;<br>
In his heart, he loves what is profound;<br>
In his relations with others, he loves kindness;<br>
In his words, he loves sincerity;<br>
In government, he loves peace;<br>
In business affairs, he loves ability;<br>
In hi actions, he loves choosing the right time.<br>
It is because he does not contend<br>
That he is without reproach.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
九章<br>
<span class="remarks">持而盈之，不如其已。</span><br>
揣而锐之，不可长保。<br>
金玉满堂，莫之能守。<br>
富贵而骄，自遗其咎。<br>
功遂身退，天下之道。<br>
<br>
Stretch (a bow) to the very full,<br>
And you will wish you had stopped in time.<br>
Temper a (sword-edge) to its very sharpest,<br>
And the edge will not last long.<br>
When gold and jade fill your hall,<br>
You will not be able to keep them safe.<br>
To be proud with wealth and honor<br>
Is to sow seeds of one's own downfall.<br>
Retire when your work is done,<br>
Such is Heaven's way.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十章<br>
<span class="remarks">载营魄抱一，能无离乎？</span><br>
专气致柔，能如婴儿乎？<br>
修除玄览，能无疵乎？<br>
爱民治国，能无智乎？<br>
天门开阖，能为雌乎？<br>
明白四达，能无知乎？<br>
<br>
生之、畜之，生而不有，长而不宰。<br>
是为玄德。<br>
<br>
In embracing the One with your soul,<br>
Can you never forsake the Tao?<br>
In controlling your vital force to achieve gentleness,<br>
Can you become like the new-born child?<br>
In cleansing and purifying your Mystic vision,<br>
Can you strive after perfection?<br>
In loving the people and governing the kingdom,<br>
Can you rule without interference?<br>
In opening and shutting the Gate of Heaven,<br>
Can you play the part of the Female?<br>
In comprehending all knowledge,<br>
Can you renounce the mind?<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十一章<br>
<span class="remarks">三十辐共一毂，当其无，有车之用。</span><br>
埏埴以为器，当其无，有器之用。<br>
凿户牖以为室，当其无，有室之用。<br>
故有之以为利，无之以为用。<br>
<br>
Thirty spokes unite around the nave;<br>
From their not-being (loss of their individuality)<br>
Arises the utility of the wheel.<br>
Mold clay into a vessel;<br>
From its not-being (in the vessel's hollow)<br>
Arises the utility of the vessel.<br>
Cut out doors and windows in the house (-wall),<br>
From their not-being (empty space) arises the utility<br>
of the house.<br>
Therefore by the existence of things we profit.<br>
And by the non-existence of things we are served.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十二章<br>
<span class="remarks">五色令人目盲；</span><br>
五音令人耳聋；<br>
五味令人口爽；<br>
驰骋畋猎，令人心发狂；<br>
难得之货，令人行妨。<br>
是以圣人为腹不为目，故去彼取此。<br>
<br>
The five colors blind the eyes of man;<br>
The five musical notes deafen the ears of man;<br>
The five flavors dull the taste of man;<br>
Horse-racing, hunting and chasing madden the minds of man;<br>
Rare, valuable goods keep their owners awake at night.<br>
Therefore the Sage:<br>
Provides for the belly and not the eye.<br>
Hence, he rejects the one and accepts the other.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十三章<br>
<span class="remarks">宠辱若惊，贵大患若身。</span><br>
何谓宠辱若惊？<br>
宠为下，得之若惊，失之若惊，是谓宠辱若惊。<br>
何谓贵大患若身？<br>
吾所以有大患者，为吾有身，及吾<br>
无身，吾有何患？<br>
故贵以身为天下，若可寄天下；<br>
爱以身为天下，若可托天下。<br>
<br>
"Favor and disgrace cause one dismay;<br>
What we value and what we fear are within our Self."<br>
What does this mean:<br>
"Favor and disgrace cause one dismay?"<br>
Those who receive a favor from above<br>
Are dismayed when they receive it,<br>
And dismayed when they lose it.<br>
What does this mean:<br>
"What we value and what we fear are within our Self?"<br>
We have fears because we have a self.<br>
When we do not regard that self as self,<br>
What have we to fear?<br>
Therefore he who values the world as his self<br>
May then be entrusted with the government of the world;<br>
And he who loves the world as his self -<br>
The world may then be entrusted to his care.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十四章<br>
<span class="remarks">视之不见，名曰微；</span><br>
听之不闻，名曰希；<br>
搏之不得，名曰夷。<br>
此三者，不可致诘，故混而为一。<br>
其上不皎，其下不昧，绳绳兮不可名，复归于<br>
物。<br>
是谓无状之状，无物之象，是谓惚恍。<br>
迎之不见其首，随之不见其后。<br>
执古之道，以御今之有。<br>
能知古始，是谓道纪。<br>
<br>
Looked at, but cannot be seen -<br>
That is called the Invisible (yi).<br>
Listened to, but cannot be heard -<br>
That is called the Inaudible (hsi).<br>
Grasped at, but cannot be touched -<br>
That is called the Intangible (wei).<br>
These three elude our inquiries<br>
And hence blend and become One.<br>
Not by its rising, is there light,<br>
Nor by its sinking, is there darkness.<br>
Unceasing, continuous,<br>
It cannot be defined,<br>
And reverts again to the realm of nothingness.<br>
That is why it is called the Form of the Formless,<br>
The Image of Nothingness.<br>
That is why it is called the Elusive:<br>
Meet it and you do not see its face;<br>
Follow it and you do not see its back.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十五章<br>
<span class="remarks">古之善为道者，微妙玄通，深不可识。</span><br>
夫唯不可识，故强为之容：豫兮，若冬涉川；<br>
犹兮，若畏四邻；<br>
俨兮，其若客；<br>
涣兮，其若凌释；<br>
敦兮<br>
，其若朴；<br>
旷兮，其若谷；<br>
混兮，其若浊。<br>
孰能浊以止？<br>
静之徐清。<br>
孰能安以久？<br>
动之徐生。<br>
保此道者，不欲盈。<br>
夫唯不盈，故能蔽而新成。<br>
<br>
The wise ones of old had subtle wisdom and depth of understanding,<br>
So profound that they could not be understood.<br>
And because they could not be understood,<br>
Perforce must they be so described:<br>
Cautious, like crossing a wintry stream,<br>
Irresolute, like one fearing danger all around,<br>
Grave, like one acting as guest,<br>
Self-effacing, like ice beginning to melt,<br>
Genuine, like a piece of undressed wood,<br>
Open-minded, like a valley,<br>
And mixing freely, like murky water.<br>
Who can find repose in a muddy world?<br>
By lying still, it becomes clear.<br>
Who can maintain his calm for long?<br>
By activity, it comes back to life.<br>
He who embraces this Tao<br>
Guards against being over-full.<br>
Because he guards against being over-full,<br>
He is beyond wearing out and renewal.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十六章<br>
<span class="remarks">致虚极，守静笃。</span><br>
万物并作，吾以观复。<br>
夫物芸芸，各复归其根。<br>
归根曰静，静曰复命。<br>
复命曰常，知常曰明。<br>
不知常，妄作，凶。<br>
知常容，<br>
容乃公，公乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久，殁身不殆。<br>
<br>
Attain the utmost in Passivity,<br>
Hold firm to the basis of Quietude.<br>
The myriad things take shape and rise to activity,<br>
But I watch them fall back to their repose.<br>
Like vegetation that luxuriantly grows<br>
But returns to the root (soil) from which it springs.<br>
To return to the root is Repose;<br>
It is called going back to one's Destiny.<br>
Going back to one's Destiny is to find the Eternal Law.<br>
To know the Eternal Law is Enlightenment.<br>
And not to know the Eternal Law<br>
Is to court disaster.<br>
He who knows the Eternal Law is tolerant;<br>
Being tolerant, he is impartial;<br>
Being impartial, he is kingly;<br>
Being kingly, he is in accord with Nature;<br>
Being in accord with Nature, he is in accord with Tao;<br>
Being in accord with Tao, he is eternal,<br>
And his whole life is preserved from harm.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十七章<br>
<span class="remarks">太上，不知有之；</span><br>
其次，亲而誉之；<br>
其次，畏之；<br>
其次，侮之。<br>
信不足焉，有不信焉。<br>
悠兮，其贵言。<br>
功成事遂，百姓皆谓：「我自然」。<br>
<br>
Of the best rulers<br>
The people (only) know that they exist;<br>
The next best the love and praise;<br>
The next they fear;<br>
And the next they revile.<br>
When they do not command the people's faith,<br>
Some will lose faith in them,<br>
And then they resort to oaths!<br>
But (of the best) when their task is accomplished,<br>
their work done,<br>
The people all remark, "We have done it ourselves."<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十八章<br>
<span class="remarks">大道废，有仁义；</span><br>
智慧出，有大伪；<br>
六亲不和，有孝慈；<br>
国家昏乱，有忠臣。<br>
<br>
On the decline of the great Tao,<br>
The doctrine of "humanity" and "justice" arose.<br>
When knowledge and cleverness appeared,<br>
Great hypocrisy followed in its wake.<br>
When the six relationships no longer lived at peace,<br>
There was (praise of) "kind parents" and "filial sons."<br>
When a country fell into chaos and misrule,<br>
There was (praise of) "loyal ministers."<br>
<br>
-------<br>
十九章<br>
<span class="remarks">绝圣弃智，民利百倍；</span><br>
绝仁弃义，民复孝慈；<br>
绝巧弃利，盗贼无有。<br>
此三者以为文，不足。<br>
故令有所属：见素抱朴，少思寡欲，绝学无忧。<br>
<br>
Banish wisdom, discard knowledge,<br>
And the people shall profit a hundredfold;<br>
Banish "humanity," discard "justice,"<br>
And the people shall recover love of their kin;<br>
Banish cunning, discard "utility,"<br>
And the thieves and brigands shall disappear.<br>
As these three touch the externals and are inadequate,<br>
The people have need of what they can depend upon:<br>
Reveal thy simple self,<br>
Embrace thy original nature,<br>
Check thy selfishness,<br>
Curtail thy desires.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
二十章<br>
<span class="remarks">唯之与阿，相去几何？</span><br>
美之与恶，相去若何？<br>
人之所畏，不可不畏。<br>
荒兮，其未央哉！众人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登台。<br>
我独泊兮，其未兆；<br>
<br>
沌沌兮，如婴儿之未孩；<br>
儡儡兮，若无所归。<br>
众人皆有馀，而我独若遗。<br>
我愚人之心也哉，沌沌兮！俗人昭昭，我独昏昏。<br>
俗人察察，我独闷<br>
闷。<br>
淡兮，其若海，望兮，若无止。<br>
众人皆有以，而我独顽似鄙。<br>
我独异于人，而贵食母。<br>
<br>
Banish learning, and vexations end.<br>
Between "Ah!" and "Ough!"<br>
How much difference is there?<br>
Between "good" and "evil"<br>
How much difference is there?"<br>
That which men fear<br>
Is indeed to be feared;<br>
But, alas, distant yet is the dawn (of awakening)!<br>
The people of the world are merry-making,<br>
As if partaking of the sacrificial feasts,<br>
As if mounting the terrace in spring;<br>
I alone am mild, like one unemployed,<br>
Like a new-born babe that cannot yet smile,<br>
Unattached, like one without a home.<br>
The people of the world have enough and to spare,<br>
But I am like one left out,<br>
My heart must be that of a fool,<br>
Being muddled, nebulous!<br>
The vulgar are knowing, luminous;<br>
I alone am dull, confused.<br>
The vulgar are clever, self-assured;<br>
I alone, depressed.<br>
Patient as the sea,<br>
Adrift, seemingly aimless.<br>
The people of the world all have a purpose;<br>
I alone appear stubborn and uncouth.<br>
I alone differ from the other people,<br>
And value drawing sustenance from the Mother.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
二十一章<br>
<span class="remarks">孔德之容，惟道是从。</span><br>
道之为物，惟恍惟惚。<br>
惚兮恍兮，其中有象；<br>
恍兮惚兮，其中有物；<br>
窈兮冥兮，其中有精；<br>
其精甚真，其中有信。<br>
自今<br>
及古，其名不去，以阅众甫。<br>
吾何以知众甫之状哉？<br>
以此。<br>
<br>
The marks of great Character<br>
Follow alone from the Tao.<br>
The thing that is called Tao<br>
Is elusive, evasive.<br>
Evasive, elusive,<br>
Yet latent in it are forms.<br>
Elusive, evasive,<br>
Yet latent in it are objects.<br>

To yield is to be preserved whole.<br>
To be bent is to become straight.<br>
To be hollow is to be filled.<br>
To be tattered is to be renewed.<br>
To be in want is to possess.<br>
To have plenty is to be confused.<br>
Therefore the Sage embraces the One,<br>
And becomes the model of the world.<br>
He does not reveal himself,<br>
And is therefore luminous.<br>
He does not justify himself,<br>
And is therefore far-famed.<br>
He does not boast of himself,<br>
And therefore people give him credit.<br>
He does not pride himself,<br>
And is therefore the chief among men.<br>
Is it not indeed true, as the ancients say,<br>
"To yield is to be preserved whole?"<br>
Thus he is preserved and the world does him homage.<br>

From Nature.<br>
Even Nature does not last long (in its utterances),<br>

He who follows the Tao is identified with the Tao.<br>
He who follows Character (Teh) is identified with<br>

and very easy to practice,<br>
But no one can understand them and<br>
no one can practice them.<br>
In my words there is a principle.<br>
In the affairs of men there is a system.<br>
Because they know not these,<br>
They also know me not.<br>
Since there are few that know me,<br>
Therefore I am distinguished.<br>
Therefore the Sage wears a coarse cloth on top<br>
And carries jade within his bosom.<br>
<br>

七十一章<br>
<span class="remarks">知不知，上，不知不知，病。</span><br>
圣人不病，以其病病，是以不病。<br>
<br>
Who knows that he does not know is the highest;<br>
Who (pretends to) know what he does not know is sick-minded.<br>
And who recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindedness<br>
is not sick-minded.<br>
The Sage is not sick-minded.<br>
Because he recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindness,<br>
Therefore he is not sick-minded.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十二章<br>
<span class="remarks">民不畏威，则大威至。</span><br>
无狎其所居，无厌其所生。<br>
夫唯不厌，是以不厌。<br>
是以圣人自知不自见，自爱不自贵。<br>
故去彼取此。<br>
<br>
When people have no fear of force,<br>
Then (as is the common practice) great force descends<br>
upon them.<br>
Despise not their dwellings,<br>
Dislike not their progeny.<br>
Because you do not dislike them,<br>
You will not be disliked yourself.<br>
Therefore the Sage knows himself, but does not show himself,<br>
Loves himself, but does not exalt himself.<br>
Therefore he rejects the one (force) and<br>
accepts the other (gentility).<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十三章<br>
<span class="remarks">勇于敢，则杀，勇于不敢，则活。</span><br>
此两者，或利或害。<br>
天之所恶，孰知其故？<br>
天之道，不争而善胜，不言而善应，不召而自来，姗然而善谋。<br>
<br>
天网恢恢，疏而不失。<br>
<br>
Who is brave in daring (you) kill,<br>
Who is brave in not daring (you) let live.<br>
In these two,<br>
There is some advantage and some disadvantage.<br>
(Even if) Heaven dislikes certain people,<br>
Who would know (who are to be killed and) why?<br>
Therefore even the Sage regards it as a difficult question.<br>
Heaven's Way (Tao) is good at conquest without strife,<br>
Rewarding (vice and virtue) without words,<br>
Making its appearance without call,<br>
Achieving results without obvious design.<br>
The heaven's net is broad and wide.<br>
With big meshes, yet letting nothing slip through.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十四章<br>
<span class="remarks">民不畏死，奈何以死惧之？</span><br>
若使民常畏死，而为奇者，吾得执而杀之，孰敢？<br>
常有司杀者杀。<br>
夫代司杀者杀，是谓代大匠斫。<br>
夫代大匠斫者，<br>
希有不伤其手矣。<br>
<br>
The people are not afraid of death;<br>
Why threaten them with death?<br>
Supposing that the people<br>
are afraid of death,<br>
And we can seize and kill the unruly,<br>
Who would dare to do so?<br>
Often it happens that the executioner is killed.<br>
And to take the place of the executioner<br>
Is like handling the hatchet for the master carpenter.<br>
He who handles the hatchet for the master carpenter<br>
seldom escapes injury to his hands.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十五章<br>
<span class="remarks">民之饥，以其上食税之多，是以饥。</span><br>
民之不治，以其上之有为，是以不治。<br>
民之轻死，以其上求生之厚，是以轻死。<br>
夫唯无以生为者，是贤于<br>
贵生。<br>
<br>
When people are hungry,<br>
It is because their rulers eat too much tax-grain.<br>
Therefore the unruliness of hungry people<br>
Is due to the interference of their rulers.<br>
That is why they are unruly.<br>
The people are not afraid of death,<br>
Because they are anxious to make a living.<br>
That is why they are not afraid of death.<br>
It is those who interfere not with their living<br>
That are wise in exalting life.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十六章<br>
<span class="remarks">人之生也柔弱，其死也坚强。</span><br>
草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁。<br>
故坚强者死之徒，柔弱者生之徒。<br>
是以兵强则灭，木强则折，强大居下，柔弱居<br>
上。<br>
<br>
When man is born, he is tender and weak;<br>
At death, he is hard and stiff.<br>
When the things and plants are alive, they are soft<br>
and supple;<br>
When they are dead, they are brittle and dry.<br>
Therefore hardness and stiffness are the companions of<br>
death,<br>
And softness and gentleness are the companions of life.<br>
Therefore when an army is headstrong, it will lose in a battle.<br>
When a tree is hard, it will be cut down.<br>
The big and strong belong underneath.<br>
The gentle and weak belong at the top.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十七章<br>
<span class="remarks">天之道，其犹张弓欤？</span><br>
高者抑之，下者举之，有馀者损之，不足者补之。<br>
天之道，损有馀而补不足。<br>
人之道，则不然：损不足以奉有馀。<br>
孰能<br>
有馀以奉天下？<br>
唯有道者。<br>
是以圣人为而不恃，功成而不居，其不欲见贤。<br>
<br>
The Tao (way) of Heaven,<br>
Is it not like the bending of a bow?<br>
The top comes down and the bottom-end goes up,<br>
The extra (length) is shortened, the insufficient (width)<br>
is expanded.<br>
It is the way of Heaven to take away from those that have too much<br>
And give to those that have not enough.<br>
Not so with man's way:<br>
He takes from those that have not<br>
And gives it as tribute to those that have too much.<br>
Who can have enough and to spare to give to the entire world?<br>
Only the man of Tao.<br>
Therefore the Sage acts, but does not possess,<br>
Accomplishes but lays claim to no credit,<br>
Because he has no wish to seem superior.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十八章<br>
<span class="remarks">天下莫柔弱于水，而攻坚强者莫之能胜，以其无以易之。</span><br>
弱之胜强，柔之胜刚，天下莫不知，莫能行。<br>
是以圣人云：「受国之垢，是谓社稷主<br>
；<br>
受国不祥，是为天下王。<br>
」正言若反。<br>
<br>
There is nothing weaker than water<br>
But none is superior to it in overcoming the hard,<br>
For which there is no substitute.<br>
That weakness overcomes strength<br>
And gentleness overcomes rigidity,<br>
No one does not know;<br>
No one can put into practice.<br>
Therefore the Sage says:<br>
"Who receives unto himself the calumny of the world<br>
Is the preserver of the state.<br>
Who bears himself the sins of the world<br>
Is king of the world."<br>
Straight words seem crooked.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
七十九章<br>
<span class="remarks">和大怨，必有馀怨，安可以为善？</span><br>
是以圣人执左契而不责于人。<br>
有德司契，无德司彻。<br>
天道无亲，恒与善人。<br>
<br>
Patching up a great hatred is sure to leave some hatred behind.<br>
How can this be regarded as satisfactory?<br>
Therefore the Sage holds the left tally,<br>
And does not put the guilt on the other party.<br>
the virtuous man is for patching up;<br>
The vicious is for fixing guilt.<br>
But "the way of Heaven is impartial;<br>
It sides only with the good man."<br>
<br>
-------<br>
八十章<br>
<span class="remarks">小邦寡民。</span><br>
使有什伯之器而不用；<br>
使民重死而不远徙。<br>
虽有舟舆，无所乘之；<br>
虽有甲兵，无所陈之。<br>
使民复结绳而用之。<br>
甘其食，美其服，安<br>
其居，乐其俗。<br>
邻邦相望，鸡犬之声相闻，民至老死，不相往来。<br>
<br>
(Let there be) a small country with a small population,<br>
Where the supply of goods are tenfold or hundredfold,<br>
more than they can use.<br>
Let the people value their lives and not migrate far.<br>
Though there be boats and carriages,<br>
None be there to ride them.<br>
Though there be armor and weapons,<br>
No occasion to display them.<br>
Let the people again tie ropes for reckoning,<br>
Let them enjoy their food,<br>
Beautify their clothing,<br>
Be satisfied with their homes,<br>
Delight in their customs.<br>
The neighboring settlements overlook one another<br>
So that they can hear the barking of dogs and crowing<br>
of cocks of their neighbors,<br>
And the people till the end of their days shall never<br>
have been outside their country.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
八十一章<br>
<span class="remarks">信言不美，美言不信。</span><br>
善者不辩，辩者不善。<br>
知者不博，博者不知。<br>
圣人不积，既以为人己愈有，既以与人己愈多。<br>
天之道，利而不害；<br>
圣人<br>
之道，为而不争。<br>
<br>
True words are not fine-sounding;<br>
Fine-sounding words are not true.<br>
A good man does not argue;<br>
he who argues is not a good man.<br>
the wise one does not know many things;<br>
He who knows many things is not wise.<br>
The Sage does not accumulate (for himself).<br>
He lives for other people,<br>
And grows richer himself;<br>
He gives to other people,<br>
And has greater abundance.<br>
The Tao of Heaven<br>
Blesses, but does not harm.<br>
The Way of the Sage<br>
Accomplishes, but does not contend.<br>
