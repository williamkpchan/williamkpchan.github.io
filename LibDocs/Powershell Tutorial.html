<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-0">What is PowerShell?</h3>
Windows PowerShell is object-oriented automation engine and scripting language. 
It is designed mainly for the system administrators. 
It helps IT, professionals, to control &amp; automate the administration of the Window OS and other applications. 

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-1">Features of Powershell</h3>
<k>PowerShell Remoting</k>: PowerShell allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine.
<k>Background Jobs</k>: It helps you to invoked script or pipeline asynchronously. 
You can run your jobs either on the local machine or multiple remotely operated machines.
<k>Transactions</k>: Enable cmdlet and allows developers to perform
<k>Evening:</k> This command helps you to listen, forwarding, and acting on management and system events.
<k>Network File Transfer:</k> Powershell offers native support for prioritized, asynchronous, throttled, transfer of files between machines using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) technology.

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-2">How to launch PowerShell</h3>
PowerShell is pre-installed in all latest versions of Windows. 
We need to launch PowerShell for that we need to follow the given steps: 
<k>Step 1)</k> Search for PowerShell in Windows. 
Select and Click <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT1.png">
<k>Step 2)</k> Power Shell Window Opens 
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT2.png">

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-3"> PowerShell Cmdlet</h3>
A cmdlet which is also called Command let is a is a lightweight command used in the Window base PowerShell environment. 
PowerShell invokes these cmdlets in the command prompt. 
You can create and invoke cmdlets command using PowerShell APIS. 

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-4">Cmdlet vs. Command:</h3>
Cmdlets are different from commands in other command-shell environments in the following manners −
Cmdlets are .NET Framework class objects It can't be executed separately
Cmdlets can construct from as few as a dozen lines of code
Parsing, output formatting, and error presentation are not handled by cmdlets
Cmdlets process works on objects. 
So text stream and objects can't be passed as output for pipelining
Cmdlets are record-based as so it processes a single object at a time

Most of the PowerShell functionality comes from Cmdlet's which is always in verb-noun format and not plural. 
Moreover, Cmdlet's return objects not text. 
A cmdlet is a series of commands, which is more than one line, stored in a text file with a .ps1 extension. 

A cmdlet always consists of a verb and a noun, separated with a hyphen. 
Some of the verbs use for you to learn PowerShell is:
<k>Get </k>— To get something
<k>Start</k> — To run something
<k>Out</k> — To output something
<k>Stop</k> — To stop something that is running
<k>Set </k>— To define something
<k>New</k> — To create something 

<k>PowerShell commands</k>

Following is a list of important PowerShell Commands: 
<k>Get-Help:</k> Help about PowerShell commands and PowerShellScriptingtopics 
Example: Display help information about the command Format-Table
Get-Help Format-Table

<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT3.png">
<k>Get-Command:</k> Get information about anything that can be invoked 
Example: To generate a list of cmdlets, functions installed in your machine
Get-Command
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT4.png">
<k>Get-Service:</k> Finds all cmdlets with the word 'service' in it. 

Example: Get all services that begin with "vm"
Get-Service "vm*"
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT5.png">
<k>Get- Member:</k> Show what can be done with an object 
Example: Get members of the vm processes.
Get-Service "vm*" | Get-Member
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT6.png">
<k>Other Commands:</k>
Get Module Shows packages of commands 
Get Content This cmdlet can take a file and process its contents and do something with it 
Get- get Finds all cmdlets starting with the word 'get- 

Example: Create a Folder
New-Item -Path 'X:\Guru99' -ItemType Directory
Output

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-5">Powershell Data types:</h3>
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT8.jpg"><k> </k> 
<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-6">Special Variables </h3><table class="table table-striped"><tbody><tr><td>Special Variable </td><td>Description </td></tr><tr><td>$Error </td><td>An array of error objects which display the most recent errors </td></tr><tr><td>$Host </td><td>Display the name of the current hosting application </td></tr><tr><td>$Profile </td><td>Stores entire path of a user profile for the default shell </td></tr><tr><td>$PID </td><td>Stores the process identifier </td></tr><tr><td>$PSUICulture </td><td>It holds the name of the current UI culture. 
</td></tr><tr><td>$NULL </td><td>Contains empty or NULL value. 
</td></tr><tr><td>$False </td><td>Contains FALSE value </td></tr><tr><td>$True </td><td>Contains TRUE value </td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-7">PowerShell Scripts</h3>
Powershell scripts are store in .ps1 file. 
By default, you can't run a script by just double-clicking a file. 
This protects your system from accidental harm. 
To execute a script: 

Step 1: right-click it and click "Run with PowerShell." 
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT9.png">
Moreover, there is a policy which restricts script execution. 
You can see this policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command. 

You will get one of the following output:
<k>Restricted</k>— No scripts are allowed. 
This is the default setting, so it will display first time when you run the command. 

<k>AllSigned</k>— You can run scripts signed by a trusted developer. 
With the help of this setting, a script will ask for confirmation that you want to run it before executing. 

<k>RemoteSigned</k>— You can run your or scripts signed by a trusted developer. 

<k>Unrestricted</k>— You can run any script which you wants to run 

Steps to Change Execution Policy 
<k>Step 1)</k> Open an elevated PowerShell prompt. 
Right Click on PowerShell and "Run as Administrator" 
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT10.png">
<k>Step 2)</k> Enter the Following commands Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-execution policy unrestricted
Enter Y in the prompt

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-8"> First PowerShell Script</h3>
In a notepad write the following command
Write-Host "Hello, Guru99!"
PowerShell Scripts have an extension ps1. 
Save the file as FirstScript.ps1 
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT12.png">
In Powershell, call the script using the command
&amp; "X:\FirstScript.ps1"
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT13.png">
<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-9">What is PowerShell ISE?</h3>
The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment(ISE) is the default editor for Windows PowerShell. 
In this ISE, you can run commands, writer test, and debug scripts in an in a window base GUI environment. 
You can do multiline editing, syntax coloring, tab completion, selective execution and lots of other things. 

Windows PowerShell ISE also allows you to run commands in a console pane. 
However, it also supports panes that you can use to simultaneously view the source code of your script and other tools which you can plug into the ISE. 

You can even open up multiple script windows at the same time. 
This is specifically useful when you are debugging a script which uses functions defined in other scripts or modules. 

<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT14.png">
The same script we created in notepad, can be created in ISE

Paste code into the editor
Save Script
Use F5 to run the script
Observe output in the console

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-11">Advantages of using PowerShell script</h3>
PowerShell scripts are really powerful and could do much stuff in fewer lines. 

Variables are declared in the form $&lt;variable&gt;
Variables could be used to hold the output of command, objects, and values.
"Type" of a variable need not be specified.

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-13">Applications of Powershell</h3>
Today, PowerShell has become an ideal choice for IT administrators as it eases management operation and effort in large corporate networks. 
For example, let's assume that you are managing a large network which contains more than four hundred servers. 
Now you want to implement a new security solution. 
This security solution depends on a certain service which needs to run on those servers. 

You can surely log in to each server and see if they have that service install and running or not. 
However, it certainly takes a lot of human errors as your staff needs to spend lots of time on this non-productive process. 

However, if you use PowerShell, then you could complete this task in just a few minutes. 
That's because the entire operation is done with a single script which gathers information about the services running on the servers.

<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-14"><span class="gold">How to Write and Run Scripts in the Windows PowerShell ISE</span></h3>
<h3 id="PowerShellScriptingtopic-15">How to create and run scripts</h3>
You can open and edit Windows PowerShell files in the Script Pane. 
Specific file types of interest in Windows PowerShell are script files (<code>.ps1</code>), script data files (<code>.psd1</code>), and script module files
(<code>.psm1</code>). 
These file types are syntax colored in the Script Pane editor. 
Other common file types you may open in the Script Pane are configuration files (<code>.ps1xml</code>), XML files, and text files.

Note

The Windows PowerShell execution policy determines whether you can run scripts and load Windows
PowerShell profiles and configuration files. 
The default execution policy, Restricted, prevents all scripts from running, and prevents loading profiles. 
To change the execution policy to allow profiles to load and be used, see
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/components/ise//en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy" data-linktype="absolute-path">Set-ExecutionPolicy</a> and

By default, Windows PowerShell ISE saves new script files (<code>.ps1</code>), script data files (<code>.psd1</code>), and script module files (<code>.psm1</code>) as Unicode (BigEndianUnicode) by default. 
To save a script in another encoding, such as ASCII (ANSI), use the <k>Save</k> or <k>SaveAs</k> methods on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/components/ise/object-model/the-ise-object-model-hierarchy?view=powershell-6" data-linktype="relative-path">$psISE.CurrentFile</a> object.

The following command saves a new script as MyScript.ps1 with ASCII encoding.

<code>$psISE.CurrentFile.SaveAs("MyScript.ps1", [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII)</code>
The following command replaces the current script file with a file with the same name, but with ASCII encoding.

<code>$psISE.CurrentFile.Save([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII)</code>
The following command gets the encoding of the current file.

<code>$psISE.CurrentFile.encoding</code>
Windows PowerShell ISE supports the following encoding options: ASCII, BigEndianUnicode, Unicode, UTF32, UTF7, UTF8, and Default. 
The value of the Default option varies with the system.

Windows PowerShell ISE doesn't change the encoding of script files when you use the Save or Save As commands.

<h3 id="topic-0"><pk>Introduction</pk></h3>
Windows PowerShell is a tool for task automation and configuration management that combines a command line shell with a scripting language.
IT professionals rely on PowerShell to:
Automate common tasks
Manage remote machines
Share data between applications
Manage infrastructure as code
Learning even a few basic set of Windows PowerShell commands and core scripting capabilities can help you achieve significant automation.
To help, this PowerShell tutorial covers PowerShell scripting basics for beginners.
<k id="topic-1">  Caution:</k> Once you’ve learned a few PowerShell basics, it is easy to start running commands — but they can have a profound impact on the stability and security of your IT ecosystem.
As you are getting started with PowerShell, be sure to experiment with it only in a sandboxed environment.

<h3 id="topic-2"><pk>Setting up your PowerShell environment</pk></h3>
Before you can run PowerShell scripts, you need to set up the Windows PowerShell environment.
Here are the steps involved.
<h3 id="topic-3"> Install PowerShell</h3>
PowerShell comes pre-installed on most Windows operating systems.
However, if you need to install a newer version, you can download it from the Microsoft website or use Windows Package Manager (Winget) or Chocolatey Package Manager.
<h3 id="topic-4"> Run PowerShell</h3>
To launch the PowerShell command line, enter powershell.exe in the Windows Start menu.
You’ll see a screen like the following:
<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1.png">
<h3 id="topic-5"> Check the execution policy</h3>
By default, PowerShell restricts the running of scripts for security reasons.
You can check your policy’s setting by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command:

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2.png">

You will get one of the following values:
<k id="topic-6">  Restricted </k>— No PowerShell scripts may be run.
This is the default setting.
<k id="topic-7">  AllSigned </k>— You can run PowerShell scripts signed by a trusted developer.
<k id="topic-8">  RemoteSigned </k>— You can run your own scripts or scripts signed by a trusted developer.
<k id="topic-9">  Unrestricted </k>— You can run any script you want.
To change the execution policy setting, use the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet:

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/3.png">

<h3 id="topic-10"> Install modules and packages</h3>
Windows PowerShell can be extended with additional modules and packages from the PowerShell Gallery public repository or other sources.
You can use the Install-Module cmdletto install modules directly from the PowerShell Gallery.
Then you can use the cmdlets and functions defined in the module just like built-in PowerShell commands.
<h3 id="topic-11"><pk>PowerShell cmdlets</pk></h3>
PowerShell includes a wide range of cmdlets (pronounced “command-lets”) for common administrative tasks, such as managing processes, services, files, and users.
Each one performs a single function but they can be combined in PowerShell scripting.
Cmdlets have a verb-noun structure, where the verb indicates the action to be performed and the noun specifies the target of the action, such as <k id="topic-12">  Get-Help</k>, <k id="topic-13">  Set-Item</k>, <k id="topic-14">  Start-Service</k> or <k id="topic-15">  Stop-Process</k>.
Other key verbs include <k id="topic-16">  Out</k>, which is used to output something (such as a file), and <k id="topic-17">  New</k>, which is used to create something (“new” is not a verb, of course, but it functions as one).
Cmdlets typically produce objects as output, allowing for easy manipulation and integration with other cmdlets and scripts.
<h3 id="topic-18"> Examples of PowerShell cmdlets</h3>
 <k id="topic-19">  Get-Process:</k> Gets the information about running processes of the system.

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5.png">

<k id="topic-20">  Get-Service:</k> Retrieves the status of services on the system.

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/6.png">

<k id="topic-21">  Get-ChildItem:</k> Retrieves a list of files and folders in a directory.

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/7.png">

<h3 id="topic-22"> Cmdlet aliases</h3>
Many cmdlets have one or more aliases, which are shortened versions of their names.
For example, the following two commands perform the same action:
Start-Process notepad
start notepad
Similarly, you can use either of the following commands to stop the Notepad process:
Stop-Process -Name notepad
spps -Name notepad
To see all aliases, run the <k id="topic-23">  Get-Alias</k> cmdlet:

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8.png">

<h3 id="topic-24"> Cmdlet parameters and arguments</h3>
Cmdlets accept parameters that control their behavior.
Parameters are specified using a hyphen followed by the parameter name, such as <k id="topic-25">  -Name </k>or <k id="topic-26">  -Path</k>.
Some parameters accept arguments, which are values of a particular data type (data types are explained below).
For example, here is the syntax of the <k id="topic-27">  Get-Process</k> cmdlet with its parameters in orange and their arguments in green:
Get-Process
[-Name &lt;String[]&gt;]
[-ComputerName &lt;String[]&gt;]
[-FileVersionInfo]
[-Module]
[-InputObject &lt;Process[]&gt;]
[-IncludeUserName] [-ExcludeUserName]
[-Credential &lt;PSCredential&gt;]
[-Id &lt;Int32[]&gt;]
[-IncludeTotalProcessorTime]
[-WhatIf]
[-Confirm]
<h3 id="topic-28"> Data types</h3>
Here are some common data types in PowerShell:
<k id="topic-29">  String:</k> A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (‘ ‘) or double quotes (” “).
A string can include letters, numbers, symbols and spaces.
<k id="topic-30">  Integer:</k> Integers are whole numbers without any decimal or fractional parts.
<k id="topic-31">  Double:</k> Doubles are floating-point numbers with decimal precision, such as 3.14 or -0.5.
<k id="topic-32">  Boolean:</k> Booleans are often used in conditional expressions and comparisons.
The only possible values are <k id="topic-33">  true</k> and <k id="topic-34">  false</k>.
<k id="topic-35">  Hashtable:</k> A hashtable is a collection of key-value pairs.
Each key in a hashtable must be unique.
Hashtables are often used to store and retrieve data using named keys.
<k id="topic-36">  Array:</k> An array is a collection of ordered and indexed elements of the same data type, such as a set of names or integers.
In PowerShell, you can create an array by assigning a comma-separated list of values enclosed in parentheses to a variable, as shown here:
$fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
To access the elements of an array, you can use the index operator [<em>n</em>].
The index of the first element in the array is 0.
Below is an example:
$fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
Write-Host $fruits[0] # Output from first element: apple
Write-Host $fruits[1] # Output from second element: banana
Write-Host $fruits[2] # Output from third element: orange

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/9.png">

You can modify the elements of an array by assigning a new value to an index:
$fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
$fruits[1] = "grape"
Write-Host $fruits[1] # Output: grape

<img src="https://cdn-blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10.png">

<h3 id="topic-37"> Variables</h3>
Variables are used to store and manipulate data in PowerShell.
A variable is a named container that holds a value, such as a string, number, array or objects.
PowerShell variables are loosely typed, meaning you do not need to declare the data type of a variable when you assign a value to it.
The data type is determined dynamically based on the assigned value.
Variable names in PowerShell are comprised of the <k id="topic-38">  $</k> symbol followed by the name of the variable.
Variable names are not case?sensitive, so, for instance, <k id="topic-39">  “$MyVariable”</k> and <k id="topic-40">  “$myvariable”</k> refer to the same variable.
Each variable has a scope that determines where is can be accessed: global, script, function or local.
By default, variables are local to the scope in which they are created.
To assign a value to a variable, use the <k id="topic-41">  =</k> operator, as shown in the following two examples:
$myVariable = "Hello, World!"
$number = 42
<h3 id="topic-42"> Pipes</h3>
Cmdlets can be connected using the pipeline operator |, which passes the output of one cmdlet to the next cmdlet.
This enables creating one-line commands to perform complex operations.
For example, this command uses a pipe to output the specified string to a file:
"Hello, World!" | Out-File C:pstest.txt
And the following example gets all services and sorts them by their status:
Get-Service | Sort-Object -property Status

You can use multiple pipes.
For instance, here the first command gets all services, the second filters for running services only, and the third command limits the output to just their display names:
Get-Service | WHERE {$_.status -eq "Running"} | SELECT displayname

<h3 id="topic-43"> Getting help</h3>
You can use <k id="topic-44">  Get-Help to</k> see details about any cmdlet:

To get examples for a cmdlet, add the <k id="topic-45">  -Examples</k> parameter:
Get-Help Get-Process -Examples

<h3 id="topic-46"><pk>Some commonly used cmdlets</pk></h3>
<h3 id="topic-47"> Working with files and folders</h3>
You can use PowerShell to simplify tasks such as creating, copying, moving, deleting and modifying file and folder properties.
By using pipelines, conditional logic and loops, you can perform more complex file and folder manipulation tasks.
For example, you can use the <k id="topic-48">  Get-ChildItem</k> cmdlet to retrieve a list of files in a directory, filter the results using the <k id="topic-49">  Where-Object</k> cmdlet, and then use <k id="topic-50">  Remove-Item</k> to delete the selected files.
Below are some common PowerShell cmdlets for working with files and folders:
<k id="topic-51">  Get-ChildItem: </k>Retrieves a list of files and folders in a specified directory
<k id="topic-52">  New-Item:</k> Creates new files and folders
<k id="topic-53">  Copy-Item:</k> Copies files and folders from one location to another
<k id="topic-54">  Move-Item: </k>Moves files and folders from one location to another
<k id="topic-55">  Remove-Item: </k>Delete files and folders
<k id="topic-56">  Set-Item: </k>Modifies the properties of files and folders.
<k id="topic-57">  Test-Path:</k> Checks whether a file or folder exists at a specified path
<k id="topic-58">  Get-Content:</k> Retrieves the content of a file and outputs it to the console
<k id="topic-59">  Set-Content: </k>Writes content to a file, overwriting any existing content
<h3 id="topic-60"> Working with date and time</h3>
Below are some common PowerShell cmdlets for working with dates and time.
<k id="topic-61">  Get-Date: </k>Use this cmdlet to retrieve the current date and time.
You can also use it to convert strings to DateTime objects and format dates according to specific patterns.
Get-Date -Format: This cmdlet allows you to retrieve the current system date and time in a specific format.
For example, you can use Get-Date -Format ‘yyyy-mm-dd’ to get the date in “YYYY-MM-DD” format.
<k id="topic-62">  Set-Date:</k> This cmdlet allows you to set the system date and time.
<k id="topic-63">  New-TimeSpan:</k> This cmdlet is used to calculate the time span between two dates.
It returns a Timespan object representing the time difference, which can be used for further calculations or formatting.
Below are some examples of how you can work with dates and time in PowerShell.
To get the current time and date:
$currentDateTime = Get-Date
To create a DateTime object for a specific date in past:
$customDate = [DateTime]::Parse("2023-11-10")
Calculate the time span between the current date and a past date and store it in the variable <k id="topic-64">  $timeDifference</k>:
$timeDifference = New-TimeSpan -Start $currentDateTime -End $customDate
Print the value of the variable <k id="topic-65">  $timeDifference</k>:
Write-host $timeDifference

<h3 id="topic-66"><pk>PowerShell scripting</pk></h3>
PowerShell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks, manage systems and perform various operations using the PowerShell scripting language.
<h3 id="topic-67"> PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)</h3>
The built-in Integrated Scripting Environment enables PowerShell scripting in a graphical user interface.
It provides a powerful set of features for creating, editing, debugging and executing PowerShell scripts, including multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution and context-sensitive help.
Many of the same actions you can take in the Windows PowerShell console are available in menu items and keyboard shortcuts.
For example, when debugging a script in the Integrated Scripting Environment, you can right-click a line of code in the edit pane to set a breakpoint.
Whether you are a beginner or an experienced PowerShell user, the PowerShell ISE can streamline your workflows and increase your productivity.
To launch the PowerShell ISE, enter <k id="topic-68">  powershell ise</k> in the Start menu:

Key elements of the PowerShell ISE include:
<k id="topic-69">  Menu bar:</k> The Menu bar offers drop-down menus for File, Edit, View, Tools, Debug, Add-ons and Help.
<k id="topic-70">  Toolbar:</k> The toolbar under the Menus bar provides buttons that perform actions such as copy, cut, paste, run script, run selection and stop operation.
<k id="topic-71">  Scripting tabs:</k> Under the toolbar in the screenshot above, you can see several tabs.
Each one is a workspace for writing and running a PowerShell script.
The fully qualified path of the script file is displayed in a tooltip when you place mouse cursor on the script tab.
<k id="topic-72">  Status bar:</k> At the very bottom of the screen under the scripting tab is a status bar that shows the completion status of the commands and scripts you have run and any error messages.
<k id="topic-73">  Commands pane:</k> On the right side of the PowerShell ISE is a pane that lists all available commands.
<k id="topic-74">  Text-size slider:</k> At the bottom right is a slider you can use to increase or decrease the size of the text on the screen.
<h3 id="topic-75"> Sample scripts</h3>
Below is a simple example of a PowerShell script that demonstrates how to define variables, use an if-else statement and print a message in the PowerShell console.
# Define variables
$name = "Jennifer"
$age = 35
# Display a greeting based on the age
if ($age -ge 18) {
    Write-Host "Hello, $name! You are an adult."
} else {
    Write-Host "Hello, $name! You are a minor."
}

Here is another simple PowerShell script; it prompts the user for their name and then greets them:
# Prompt the user for their name
$name = Read-Host "Enter your name"
# Greet the user
Write-Host "Hello, $name! Welcome to PowerShell scripting."

<h3 id="topic-76"> Adding comments to scripts</h3>
Leaving comments in your scripts will help you — and your colleagues — better understand what they do.
A one-line comment starts with a number sign (#), and a block comment starts with “&lt;#” and ends with “#&gt;”.

<h3 id="topic-77"> Brackets, parentheses and braces</h3>
In PowerShell, delimiters are used for many purposes, including defining arrays, accessing elements, grouping expressions and specifying script blocks.
Here are some of the most common:
<k id="topic-78">  Square brackets:</k> Square brackets (<k id="topic-79">  []</k>) are used to define and access elements of an array.
$fruits = @("apple", "banana", "orange")
Write-Host $fruits[0]  # Output: apple
<k id="topic-80">  Parentheses:</k> Parentheses are widely used in PowerShell, such as to pass arguments, enclose multiple instructions sets or resolve ambiguity.
The operator $() is used when you need to nest parentheses in a command.
$result = $("The result is: " + (2 + 3))
Write-Host $result #Output: The result is: 5
<k id="topic-81">  Curly braces:</k> Braces ({}) are used to define script blocks, which are used in control structures like loops and conditional statements (described below), as well as with cmdlets like <k id="topic-82">  ForEach-Object</k> and <k id="topic-83">  Where-Object.
</k>For example:
$numbers = @(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
$filtered = $numbers | Where-Object { $_ -gt 3 }
Write-Host $filtered  # Output: 4 5

<h3 id="topic-84"> Loops</h3>
Loops are used in PowerShell scripts to repeat a block of code multiple times.
Here are the most common types of loops:
<k id="topic-85">  For loop:</k> Used to execute a block of code a number of times based on the factors specified.
Below is an example that will execute a write statement 5 times:
for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
  Write-Host "Iteration $i"
}

<k id="topic-86">  ForEach loop:</k> Iterates through the elements in a collection, such as an array or a set of objects, and executes the code for each one.
Here’s an example:
$colors = "Red", "Green", "Blue"
foreach ($color in $colors) {
       Write-Host "Color: $color"
}

<k id="topic-87">  While loop:</k> Executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is met.
Below is an example.
$i = 1
while ($i -le 5) {
    Write-Host "Iteration $i"
    $i++
}

<k id="topic-88">  Do-While loop:</k> Similar to a “while” loop but guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is checked.
Here’s an example:
$i = 1
do {
    Write-Host "Iteration $i"
    $i++
} while ($i -le 5)

<h3 id="topic-89"> Conditions</h3>
Conditions are used to control the flow of PowerShell scripts.
Here are some conditional statements in PowerShell:
<k id="topic-90">  If statement:</k> Executes the code if (and only if) the specified condition is true.
Here’s an example:
$num = 10
if ($num -gt 5) {
    Write-Host "The number is greater than 5"
}

<k id="topic-91">  If-else statement:</k> Extends the “if” statement by providing a block of code to execute if the condition is not true.
Here’s an example:
$num = 3
if ($num -gt 5) {
    Write-Host "The number is greater than 5"
}
else {
    Write-Host "The number is not greater than 5"
}

<k id="topic-92">  Else-if statement:</k> Allows for specifying multiple conditions to be checked in sequence instead of just two.
Here’s an example:
$num = 5
if ($num -gt 5) {
    Write-Host "The number is greater than 5"
}
elseif ($num -eq 5) {
    Write-Host "The number is equal to 5"
}
else {
    Write-Host "The number is less than 5"
}
