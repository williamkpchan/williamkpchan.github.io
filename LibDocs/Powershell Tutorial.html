<h2>What is PowerShell?</h2>
Windows PowerShell is object-oriented automation engine and scripting language. 
It is designed mainly for the system administrators. 
It helps IT, professionals, to control & automate the administration of the Window OS and other applications. 

<h2>Features of Powershell</h2>
<strong>PowerShell Remoting</strong>: PowerShell allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine.
<strong>Background Jobs</strong>: It helps you to invoked script or pipeline asynchronously. 
You can run your jobs either on the local machine or multiple remotely operated machines.
<strong>Transactions</strong>: Enable cmdlet and allows developers to perform
<strong>Evening:</strong> This command helps you to listen, forwarding, and acting on management and system events.
<strong>Network File Transfer:</strong> Powershell offers native support for prioritized, asynchronous, throttled, transfer of files between machines using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) technology.

<h2>How to launch PowerShell</h2>
PowerShell is pre-installed in all latest versions of Windows. 
We need to launch PowerShell for that we need to follow the given steps: 
<strong>Step 1)</strong> Search for PowerShell in Windows. 
Select and Click <img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT1.png>
<strong>Step 2)</strong> Power Shell Window Opens

<h3>PowerShell Cmdlet</h3>
A cmdlet which is also called Command let is a is a lightweight command used in the Window base PowerShell environment. 
PowerShell invokes these cmdlets in the command prompt. 
You can create and invoke cmdlets command using PowerShell APIS. 

<h2>Cmdlet vs. 
Command:</h2>
Cmdlets are different from commands in other command-shell environments in the following manners −
Cmdlets are .NET Framework class objects It can't be executed separately
Cmdlets can construct from as few as a dozen lines of code
Parsing, output formatting, and error presentation are not handled by cmdlets
Cmdlets process works on objects. 
So text stream and objects can't be passed as output for pipelining
Cmdlets are record-based as so it processes a single object at a time

Most of the PowerShell functionality comes from Cmdlet's which is always in verb-noun format and not plural. 
Moreover, Cmdlet's return objects not text. 
A cmdlet is a series of commands, which is more than one line, stored in a text file with a .ps1 extension. 

A cmdlet always consists of a verb and a noun, separated with a hyphen. 
Some of the verbs use for you to learn PowerShell is:
<strong>Get </strong>— To get something
<strong>Start</strong> — To run something
<strong>Out</strong> — To output something
<strong>Stop</strong> — To stop something that is running
<strong>Set </strong>— To define something
<strong>New</strong> — To create something 

<strong>PowerShell commands</strong>

Following is a list of important PowerShell Commands: 
<strong>Get-Help:</strong> Help about PowerShell commands and topics 
Example: Display help information about the command Format-Table
Get-Help Format-Table

<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT3.png>
<strong>Get-Command:</strong> Get information about anything that can be invoked 
Example: To generate a list of cmdlets, functions installed in your machine
Get-Command
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT4.png>
<strong>Get-Service:</strong> Finds all cmdlets with the word 'service' in it. 

Example: Get all services that begin with "vm"
Get-Service "vm*"
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT5.png>
<strong>Get- Member:</strong> Show what can be done with an object 
Example: Get members of the vm processes.
Get-Service "vm*" | Get-Member
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT6.png>
<strong>Other Commands:</strong>
Get Module Shows packages of commands 
Get Content This cmdlet can take a file and process its contents and do something with it 
Get- get Finds all cmdlets starting with the word 'get- 

Example: Create a Folder
New-Item -Path 'X:\Guru99' -ItemType Directory
Output

<h2>Powershell Data types:</h2>
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT8.jpg></a><strong> </strong> 
<h2>Special Variables </h2><table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>Special Variable </td><td>Description </td></tr><tr><td>$Error </td><td>An array of error objects which display the most recent errors </td></tr><tr><td>$Host </td><td>Display the name of the current hosting application </td></tr><tr><td>$Profile </td><td>Stores entire path of a user profile for the default shell </td></tr><tr><td>$PID </td><td>Stores the process identifier </td></tr><tr><td>$PSUICulture </td><td>It holds the name of the current UI culture. 
</td></tr><tr><td>$NULL </td><td>Contains empty or NULL value. 
</td></tr><tr><td>$False </td><td>Contains FALSE value </td></tr><tr><td>$True </td><td>Contains TRUE value </td></tr></table>
<h2>PowerShell Scripts</h2>
Powershell scripts are store in .ps1 file. 
By default, you can't run a script by just double-clicking a file. 
This protects your system from accidental harm. 
To execute a script: 

Step 1: right-click it and click "Run with PowerShell." 
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT9.png>
Moreover, there is a policy which restricts script execution. 
You can see this policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command. 

You will get one of the following output:
<strong>Restricted</strong>— No scripts are allowed. 
This is the default setting, so it will display first time when you run the command. 

<strong>AllSigned</strong>— You can run scripts signed by a trusted developer. 
With the help of this setting, a script will ask for confirmation that you want to run it before executing. 

<strong>RemoteSigned</strong>— You can run your or scripts signed by a trusted developer. 

<strong>Unrestricted</strong>— You can run any script which you wants to run 

Steps to Change Execution Policy 
<strong>Step 1)</strong> Open an elevated PowerShell prompt. 
Right Click on PowerShell and "Run as Administrator" 
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT10.png>
<strong>Step 2)</strong> Enter the Following commands Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-execution policy unrestricted
Enter Y in the prompt
Get-ExecutionPolicy

<h3>First PowerShell Script</h3>
In a notepad write the following command
Write-Host "Hello, Guru99!"
PowerShell Scripts have an extension ps1. 
Save the file as FirstScript.ps1 
<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT12.png>
In Powershell, call the script using the command
& "X:\FirstScript.ps1"

<h2>What is PowerShell ISE?</h2>
The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment(ISE) is the default editor for Windows PowerShell. 
In this ISE, you can run commands, writer test, and debug scripts in an in a window base GUI environment. 
You can do multiline editing, syntax coloring, tab completion, selective execution and lots of other things. 

Windows PowerShell ISE also allows you to run commands in a console pane. 
However, it also supports panes that you can use to simultaneously view the source code of your script and other tools which you can plug into the ISE. 

You can even open up multiple script windows at the same time. 
This is specifically useful when you are debugging a script which uses functions defined in other scripts or modules. 

<img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT14.png>
The same script we created in notepad, can be created in ISE

Paste code into the editor
Save Script
Use F5 to run the script
Observe output in the console

Sample 2: 
The following code will give the Free Virtual Memory in your machine

Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem –ComputerName localhost |
Select-Object -Property CSName,FreeVirtualMemory

<h2>Advantages of using PowerShell script</h2>
PowerShell scripts are really powerful and could do much stuff in fewer lines. 

Variables are declared in the form $&lt;variable&gt;
Variables could be used to hold the output of command, objects, and values.
"Type" of a variable need not be specified.</li> </ul>

<strong>Command Prompt</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>
PowerShell deeply integrates with the Windows OS. 
It offers an interactive command line interface and scripting language. </td><td>
Command Prompt is a default command line interface which provided by Microsoft. 
It is a simple win32 application that can interact and talk with any win32 objects in the Windows operating system. </td></tr><tr><td>
PowerShell uses what are known as cmdlets. 
It can be invoked either in the runtime environment or the automation scripts. </td><td>
No such features offer by command prompt. </td></tr><tr><td>
PowerShell considers them as objects.

Command Prompt or even the *nix shell, the output generated from a cmdlet is not just a stream of text but a collection of objects. </td></tr><tr><td>
The PowerShell is very advanced regarding features, capabilities and inner functioning. </td><td>
Command prompt is very basic. </td></tr></table>
<h2>Applications of Powershell</h2>
Today, PowerShell has become an ideal choice for IT administrators as it eases management operation and effort in large corporate networks. 
For example, let's assume that you are managing a large network which contains more than four hundred servers. 
Now you want to implement a new security solution. 
This security solution depends on a certain service which needs to run on those servers. 

You can surely log in to each server and see if they have that service install and running or not. 
However, it certainly takes a lot of human errors as your staff needs to spend lots of time on this non-productive process. 

However, if you use PowerShell, then you could complete this task in just a few minutes. 
That's because the entire operation is done with a single script which gathers information about the services running on the servers.

<h2><span class="gold">How to Write and Run Scripts in the Windows PowerShell ISE</span></h2>
<h2>How to create and run scripts</h2>
You can open and edit Windows PowerShell files in the Script Pane. 
Specific file types of interest in Windows PowerShell are script files (<code>.ps1</code>), script data files (<code>.psd1</code>), and script module files
(<code>.psm1</code>). 
These file types are syntax colored in the Script Pane editor. 
Other common file types you may open in the Script Pane are configuration files (<code>.ps1xml</code>), XML files, and text files.

Note

The Windows PowerShell execution policy determines whether you can run scripts and load Windows
PowerShell profiles and configuration files. 
The default execution policy, Restricted, prevents all scripts from running, and prevents loading profiles. 
To change the execution policy to allow profiles to load and be used, see

For example, in the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select 'PowerShell Scripts (<code>*.ps1</code>)'.
Click <strong>Save</strong>.

<h2> - To save a script in ASCII encoding</h2>
By default, Windows PowerShell ISE saves new script files (<code>.ps1</code>), script data files (<code>.psd1</code>), and script module files (<code>.psm1</code>) as Unicode (BigEndianUnicode) by default. 
To save a script in another encoding, such as ASCII (ANSI), use the <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>SaveAs</strong> methods on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/components/ise/object-model/the-ise-object-model-hierarchy?view=powershell-6" data-linktype="relative-path">$psISE.CurrentFile</a> object.

The following command saves a new script as MyScript.ps1 with ASCII encoding.

<code>$psISE.CurrentFile.SaveAs("MyScript.ps1", [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII)</code>
The following command replaces the current script file with a file with the same name, but with ASCII encoding.

<code>$psISE.CurrentFile.Save([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII)</code>
The following command gets the encoding of the current file.

<code>$psISE.CurrentFile.encoding</code>
Windows PowerShell ISE supports the following encoding options: ASCII, BigEndianUnicode, Unicode, UTF32, UTF7, UTF8, and Default. 
The value of the Default option varies with the system.

Windows PowerShell ISE doesn't change the encoding of script files when you use the Save or Save As commands.
