Both master and slave can transmit data at the same time.

SPI devices support much higher clock frequencies compared to I2C interfaces
The chip select signal from the master is used to select the slave.

<span class="orange">The contactless IC card is also called a logical encryption card or a memory card</span>. 

The integrated circuit in the card has <span class="orange">encryption logic and EEPROM</span> (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory). 

The logical encryption card has a storage IC card that prevents the information in the card from being arbitrarily rewritten. 

When the encryption card is operated, the password in the card must be checked first. 

Only when the check is correct and a correct response signal is sent from the card, the card can be performed. 

The correct operation, but because only one authentication, and no other security measures, it is easy to lead to password leakage and the generation of fake cards, its security performance is very low.

For example, common non-contact IC cards include X50's Mifare One series S50 and S70, and domestic Fudan FM1108. 

These cards are currently widely used in the market.

The contactless logic encryption card technology has been quickly favored by the users with its low cost, concise transaction process and simpler system architecture. 

With the continuous application process of the contactless logic encryption card, the contactless logic encryption card technology The inadequacies are also increasingly exposed. 

The criminals can use the technical loophole method to recharge and copy non-contact IC chips at low cost, such as illegally recharging or copying all kinds of "one card" and access cards, which brings great social security risks. 

Therefore, the non-contact CPU card smart card technology is becoming a technically updated option.

<span class="orange">The contactless CPU card is also called a smart card</span>. 

The integrated circuit in the card includes a central processing unit (CPU), an EEPROM, a random access memory (ROM), and an <span class="orange">on-chip operating system (COS)</span> that is solidified in a read only memory (ROM). 

The in-card chip also integrates an encryption computing coprocessor to improve security and speed, making its specifications far higher than logical encryption cards. 

The contactless CPU card has a micro-processing function, which is far superior to the logical encryption card in terms of transaction speed and data interference, and allows multiple cards to operate simultaneously, and has an anti-collision mechanism.

Compared with non-contact IC cards, non-contact CPU card smart cards have independent CPU processors and chip operating systems, so they can more flexibly support a variety of different application requirements and design transaction processes more securely. 

At the same time, compared with the non-contact IC card system, the system of the contactless CPU card smart card is more complicated, and more system modifications, such as key management, transaction process, PSAM card and card personalization, are required. 

Keys are usually divided into recharge key (ISAM card), depreciation key (PSAM card), identity authentication key (SAM card, non-contact CPU card smart card can pass internal and external authentication mechanisms, such as electronic as defined by the Ministry of Construction The transaction process of the wallet is highly reliable to meet the security and key management requirements of different business processes. 

For the electronic wallet, the storage key can be used, the consumption can use the consumption key, and the clearing can use the TAC key to update the data. 

The card application maintenance key can be used, and the card transfer key, the card master key, the application master key, etc. 

can be used in the card personalization process, and the key is used. 

The contactless CPU card smart card can be used. 

The key version mechanism, that is, for different batches of user cards, use different versions of keys to coexist in the system, achieve the purpose of natural expiration of key expiration, gradually replace the keys used in the system, and prevent the system from being long-term. 

The security risks brought by the use, non-contact CPU card smart card, can also use the key index mechanism, that is, for the issued user card, support multiple groups at the same time The key that is introduced, if the currently used key is leaked or there is a security risk, the system can urgently activate the key of another set of indexes without recycling and replacing the card on the user's hand. 

Therefore, with the non-contact IC card Compared with the system, the contactless CPU card smart card system supports a wider range of functions, and is more flexible, secure and complex. 

The contactless CPU card is inferior to the non-contact IC card in terms of fast transaction speed, which is also the non-contact IC card technology. 

An important reason for widespread use. 

However, the unilateral pursuit of transaction speed, even at the expense of security, is an infallible practice. 

Because there is no reliable security, it loses the use of IC card technology, especially non-contact CPU cards. 

At the same time, security often consumes a certain amount of transaction time and reduces the speed of transactions. 

The above is about the difference between contactless CPU card and contactless IC card from non-contact CPU card and non- The characteristics of the contact IC card and the perspective of the application requirements are briefly introduced. 

For the contradiction between security and transaction speed, The designer of the system should find the balance between the two according to the actual business needs, and we should consider your actual situation. 

The demand and various factors, fully do the technical certification and planning and design of the system transformation, and effectively study many technical problems in the implementation process, is an important prerequisite and guarantee for the success of the project.
