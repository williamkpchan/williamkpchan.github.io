Home automation project using Arduino and PIR Sensor

If you find flipping the light switch to be a pesky task then you can automate your house with the application of this project. You can make this project with the help of an Arduino and a PIR sensor.

A PIR sensor works on the principle of thermal imaging so when it senses the presence of a human or animal body in its vicinity, it automatically sends a signal to turn the device on or off. Other than home automation, you can implement this idea to enhance your home security. Although you may need to call the cops yourself.

Description: At the end of the project you will be able to control your home appliances like led, fan, bulb, etc. from the command written in Arduino IDE. You can adjust the ON and OFF times of these appliances.

One of the most popular modules i.e 2 channel relay module is used in this project which is used widely to control high voltage devices using low voltage signals. So in this project, you will learn how to use a 2 channel relay module with Arduino and PIR Sensor module.

Description: To make a robot that can be controlled using a Mobile phone by just dialing a number and then using the mobile keypad to move the robot. One can control this robot from any part of the world.

To achieve this, you are going to use a DTMF(Dual Tone Multiple Frequency) Module which is used to simply decode the keypad tones of a Mobile phone. You need two cell-phone for this project. One to dial the number and control the Robot and another one to receive the call which remains on to the robot.

You can program Arduino to use any keypad keys you want to control the Robot.

<strong><em>What is a DTMF Module?</em></strong>

DTMF module stands for dual-tone multiple frequencies. Each number in our mobile phone dial pad is a mixture of two-tone frequencies (higher and lower) and DTMF receives this tone frequency as input and decodes it into an equivalent binary form. DTMF has a wide application in home automation. When a dial pad button is pressed, DTMF receives a particular tone frequency and then decodes it into a binary number which is further processed by Arduino to perform a specific task.

Description: A servo motor is also known for its rotation with great precision. And what would be better than giving that precise distance/rotation using an ultrasonic sensor?

This project uses a servo motor and an LCD screen with an ultrasonic sensor. The distance of the object from the sensor is mapped with the rotation of the motor between 0 and 180 degrees.
So, when the object is at a distance of 30cm, the servo angle is 30 degrees and when the object is at a distance of 90 cm, the servo angle is 90 degrees, and so on.

<h3>Coke Piano and Launchpad made with Arduino</h3>

Description: These Coke are not for sale! You can play any song in a loop using these Coke cans.

As stated by Lucas Zanella:

“The hardware (the protoboard with the Arduino and components) is made of lots of transistors for ‘body signal’ amplification, so the coke when touched activates the corresponding transistor (BC548B NPN). These cokes are plugged in directly to the transistor’s base using a wire. Arduino then reads the data and sends it via serial to the python script.”
