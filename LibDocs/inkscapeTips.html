<h2>Moving, scaling, rotating</h2>
Selector<br>
the arrow on the toolbar, or press F1 or Space<br>
<br>
Move the object by dragging it. <br>
(Press Ctrl to restrict movement to horizontal and vertical.)<br>
<br>
Scale the object by dragging any handle. <br>
(Press Ctrl to preserve the original height/width ratio.)<br>
<br>
Rotate the object by dragging corner handles. <br>
(Press Ctrl to restrict rotation to 15 degree steps. <br>
Drag the cross mark to position the center of rotation.)<br>
<br>
Skew (shear) the object by dragging non-corner handles. <br>
(Press Ctrl to restrict skewing to 15 degree steps.)<br>
<br>
While in Selector, you can also use the numeric entry fields in the Controls bar (above the canvas) to set exact values for coordinates (X and Y) and size (W and H) of the selection.<br>
<br>
Transforming by keys<br>
One of Inkscape's features that set it apart from most other vector editors is its emphasis on keyboard accessibility. 
There's hardly any command or action that is impossible to do from keyboard, and transforming objects is no exception.<br>
<br>
You can use the keyboard to move (arrow keys), scale (< and > keys), and rotate ([ and ] keys) objects. 
Default moves and scales are by 2 px; with Shift, you move by 10 times that. 
Ctrl+> and Ctrl+< scale up or down to 200% or 50% of the original, respectively. 
Default rotates are by 15 degrees; with Ctrl, you rotate by 90 degrees.<br>
<br>
However, perhaps the most useful are pixel-size transformations, invoked by using Alt with the transform keys. 
For example, Alt+arrows will move the selection by 1 pixel at the current zoom (i.e. 
by 1 screen pixel, not to be confused with the px unit which is an SVG length unit independent of zoom). 
This means that if you zoom in, one Alt+arrow will result in a smaller absolute movement which will still look like one-pixel nudge on your screen. 
It is thus possible to position objects with arbitrary precision simply by zooming in or out as needed.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Alt+> and Alt+< scale selection so that its visible size changes by one screen pixel, and Alt+[ and Alt+] rotate it so that its farthest-from-center point moves by one screen pixel.<br>
<br>
Note: Linux users may not get the expected results with the Alt+arrow and a few other key combinations if their Window Manager catches those key events before they reach the inkscape application. 
One solution would be to change the WM's configuration accordingly.<br>
<br>
Multiple selections<br>
You can select any number of objects simultaneously by Shift+clicking them. 
Or, you can drag around the objects you need to select; this is called rubberband selection. 
(Selector creates rubberband when dragging from an empty space; however, if you press Shift before starting to drag, Inkscape will always create the rubberband.) Practice by selecting all three of the shapes below:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Now, use rubberband (by drag or Shift+drag) to select the two ellipses but not the rectangle:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Each individual object within a selection displays a selection cue — by default, a dashed rectangular frame. 
These cues make it easy to see at once what is selected and what is not. 
For example, if you select both the two ellipses and the rectangle, without the cues you would have hard time guessing whether the ellipses are selected or not.<br>
<br>
Shift+clicking on a selected object excludes it from the selection. 
Select all three objects above, then use Shift+click to exclude both ellipses from the selection leaving only the rectangle selected.<br>
<br>
Pressing Esc deselects any selected objects. 
Ctrl+A selects all objects in the current layer (if you did not create layers, this is the same as all objects in the document).<br>
<br>
Grouping<br>
Several objects can be combined into a group. 
A group behaves as a single object when you drag or transform it. 
Below, the three objects on the left are independent; the same three objects on the right are grouped. 
Try to drag the group.<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
To create a group, you select one or more objects and press Ctrl+G. 
To ungroup one or more groups, select them and press Ctrl+U. 
Groups themselves may be grouped, just like any other objects; such recursive groups may go down to arbitrary depth. 
However, Ctrl+U only ungroups the topmost level of grouping in a selection; you'll need to press Ctrl+U repeatedly if you want to completely ungroup a deep group-in-group.<br>
<br>
You don't necessarily have to ungroup, however, if you want to edit an object within a group. 
Just Ctrl+click that object and it will be selected and editable alone, or Shift+Ctrl+click several objects (inside or outside any groups) for multiple selection regardless of grouping. 
Try to move or transform the individual shapes in the group (above right) without ungrouping it, then deselect and select the group normally to see that it still remains grouped.<br>
<br>
Fill and stroke<br>
Probably the simplest way to paint an object some color is to select an object, and click a swatch in the palette below the canvas to paint it (change its fill color). 
Alternatively, you can open the Swatches dialog from the View menu (or press Shift+Ctrl+W), select an object, and click a swatch to paint it (change its fill color).<br>
<br>
More powerful is the Fill and Stroke dialog from the Object menu (or press Shift+Ctrl+F). 
Select the shape below and open the Fill and Stroke dialog.<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
You will see that the dialog has three tabs: Fill, Stroke paint, and Stroke style. 
The Fill tab lets you edit the fill (interior) of the selected object(s). 
Using the buttons just below the tab, you can select types of fill, including no fill (the button with the X), flat color fill, as well as linear or radial gradients. 
For the above shape, the flat fill button will be activated.<br>
<br>
Further below, you see a collection of color pickers, each in its own tab: RGB, CMYK, HSL, and Wheel. 
Perhaps the most convenient is the Wheel picker, where you can rotate the triangle to choose a hue on the wheel, and then select a shade of that hue within the triangle. 
All color pickers contain a slider to set the alpha (opacity) of the selected object(s).<br>
<br>
Whenever you select an object, the color picker is updated to display its current fill and stroke (for multiple selected objects, the dialog shows their average color). 
Play with these samples or create your own:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Using the Stroke paint tab, you can remove the stroke (outline) of the object, or assign any color or transparency to it:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
The last tab, Stroke style, lets you set the width and other parameters of the stroke:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Finally, instead of flat color, you can use gradients for fills and/or strokes:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
When you switch from flat color to gradient, the newly created gradient uses the previous flat color, going from opaque to transparent. 
Switch to the Gradient tool (Ctrl+F1) to drag the gradient handles — the controls connected by lines that define the direction and length of the gradient. 
When any of the gradient handles is selected (highlighted blue), the Fill and Stroke dialog sets the color of that handle instead of the color of the entire selected object.<br>
<br>
Yet another convenient way to change a color of an object is by using the Dropper tool (F7). 
Just click anywhere in the drawing with that tool, and the picked color will be assigned to the selected object's fill (Shift+click will assign stroke color).<br>
<br>
Duplication, alignment, distribution<br>
One of the most common operations is duplicating an object (Ctrl+D). 
The duplicate is placed exactly above the original and is selected, so you can drag it away by mouse or by arrow keys. 
For practice, try to fill the line with copies of this black square:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Chances are, your copies of the square are placed more or less randomly. 
This is where the Align and Distribute dialog (Shift+Ctrl+A) is useful. 
Select all the squares (Shift+click or drag a rubberband), open the dialog and press the “Center on horizontal axis” button, then the “Make horizontal gaps between objects equal” button (read the button tooltips). 
The objects are now neatly aligned and distributed equispacedly. 
Here are some other alignment and distribution examples:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Z-order<br>
The term z-order refers to the stacking order of objects in a drawing, i.e. 
to which objects are on top and obscure others. 
The two commands in the Object menu, Raise to Top (the Home key) and Lower to Bottom (the End key), will move your selected objects to the very top or very bottom of the current layer's z-order. 
Two more commands, Raise (PgUp) and Lower (PgDn), will sink or emerge the selection one step only, i.e. 
move it past one non-selected object in z-order (only objects that overlap the selection count, based on their respective bounding boxes).<br>
<br>
Practice using these commands by reversing the z-order of the objects below, so that the leftmost ellipse is on top and the rightmost one is at the bottom:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
A very useful selection shortcut is the Tab key. 
If nothing is selected, it selects the bottommost object; otherwise it selects the object above the selected object(s) in z-order. 
Shift+Tab works in reverse, starting from the topmost object and proceeding downwards. 
Since the objects you create are added to the top of the stack, pressing Shift+Tab with nothing selected will conveniently select the object you created last. 
Practice the Tab and Shift+Tab keys on the stack of ellipses above.<br>
<br>
Selecting under and dragging selected<br>
What to do if the object you need is hidden behind another object? You may still see the bottom object if the top one is (partially) transparent, but clicking on it will select the top object, not the one you need.<br>
<br>
This is what Alt+click is for. 
First Alt+click selects the top object just like the regular click. 
However, the next Alt+click at the same point will select the object below the top one; the next one, the object still lower, etc. 
Thus, several Alt+clicks in a row will cycle, top-to-bottom, through the entire z-order stack of objects at the click point. 
When the bottom object is reached, next Alt+click will, naturally, again select the topmost object.<br>
<br>
[If you are on Linux, you might find that Alt+click does not work properly. 
Instead, it might be moving the whole Inkscape window. 
This is because your window manager has reserved Alt+click for a different action. 
The way to fix this is to find the Window Behavior configuration for your window manager, and either turn it off, or map it to use the Meta key (aka Windows key), so Inkscape and other applications may use the Alt key freely.]<br>
<br>
This is nice, but once you selected an under-the-surface object, what can you do with it? You can use keys to transform it, and you can drag the selection handles. 
However, dragging the object itself will reset the selection to the top object again (this is how click-and-drag is designed to work — it selects the (top) object under cursor first, then drags the selection). 
To tell Inkscape to drag what is selected now without selecting anything else, use Alt+drag. 
This will move the current selection no matter where you drag your mouse.<br>
<br>
Practice Alt+click and Alt+drag on the two brown shapes under the green transparent rectangle:<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
Selecting similar objects<br>
Inkscape can select other objects similar to the object currently selected. 
For example, if you want to select all the blue squares below first select one of the blue squares, and use Edit > Select Same > Fill Color from the menu. 
All the objects with a fill color the same shade of blue are now selected.<br>
<br>
An example image<br>
In addition to selecting by fill color, you can select multiple similar objects by stroke color, stroke style, fill & stroke, and object type.<br>
<br>
<h2>Create Tiled Clones</h2>
Edit > Clone > Create Tiled Clones<br>
<br>
<h2>Radial placement with Tiled Clones</h2>
<p>
It's easy to see how to use the <span class="menu-command">Create Tiled Clones</span> dialog for rectangular grids and
patterns. But what if you need <span class="firstterm">radial</span> placement, where objects
share a common center of rotation? It's possible too!
</p>
<p>
If your radial pattern only needs to have 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 elements, then you can try the
P3, P31M, P3M1, P4, P4M, P6, or P6M symmetries. These will work nicely for snowflakes
and the like. A more general method, however, is as follows.
</p>
<p>
Choose the P1 symmetry (simple translation) and then <em>compensate</em> for
that translation by going to the <span class="menu-command">Shift</span> tab and setting <span class="menu-command">Per
row/Shift Y</span> and <span class="menu-command">Per column/Shift X</span> both to -100%. Now all
clones will be stacked exactly on top of the original. All that remains to do is to go
to the <span class="menu-command">Rotation</span> tab and set some rotation angle per column, then
create the pattern with one row and multiple columns. For example, here's a pattern made
out of a horizontal line, with 30 columns, each column rotated 6 degrees:
</p>

<img src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f01-en.svg.png" alt="An example image"/>

<p>
To get a clock dial out of this, all you need to do is cut out or simply overlay the
central part by a white circle (to do boolean operations on clones, unlink them first).
</p>
<p>
More interesting effects can be created by using both rows and columns. Here's a pattern
with 10 columns and 8 rows, with rotation of 2 degrees per row and 18 degrees per
column. Each group of lines here is a “column”, so the groups are 18 degrees from each
other; within each column, individual lines are 2 degrees apart:
</p>

<img src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f02-en.svg.png" alt="An example image"/>

<p>
In the above examples, the line was rotated around its center. But what if you want the 
center to be outside of your shape? Just click on the object twice with the Selector tool 
to enter rotation mode. Now move the object's rotation center (represented by a small cross-shaped handle) 
to the point you would like to be the center of the rotation for the Tiled Clones operation.
Then use <span class="menu-command">Create Tiled Clones</span> on the object. This is how you can do nice “explosions” 
or “starbursts” by randomizing scale, rotation, and possibly opacity:
</p>

<img src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f03-en.svg.png" alt="An example image"/>



<h2>How to do slicing (multiple rectangular export areas)?</h2>
<p>
Create a new layer, in that layer create invisible rectangles covering parts of your
image. Make sure your document uses the px unit (default), turn on grid and snap the
rects to the grid so that each one spans a whole number of px units. Assign meaningful
ids to the rects, and export each one to its own file (<span class="menu-command">File
&gt; Export PNG Image</span> (<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+E</kbd>)). Then the rects will remember
their export filenames. After that, it's very easy to re-export some of the rects:
switch to the export layer, use Tab to select the one you need (or use Find by id), and
click Export in the dialog. Or, you can write a shell script or batch file to export
all of your areas, with a command like:
</p>
<p>
inkscape -i area-id -t filename.svg
</p>
<p>
for each exported area. The -t switch tells it to use the remembered filename hint,
otherwise you can provide the export filename with the -e switch. Alternatively, you can
use the <span class="menu-command">Extensions &gt; Web &gt; Slicer</span> extensions, or <span class="menu-command">Extensions &gt; Export &gt; Guillotine</span> for similar results.
</p>



<h2>Non-linear gradients</h2>
<p>
The version 1.1 of SVG does not support non-linear gradients (i.e. those which have a
non-linear translations between colors).  You can, however, emulate them by
<span class="firstterm">multistop</span> gradients. </p>

<p>Start with a simple two-stop gradient (you can assign that in the Fill and Stroke dialog 
or use the gradient tool). Now, with the gradient tool, add a new gradient stop in
the middle; either by double-clicking on the gradient line, or by selecting the square-shaped 
gradient stop and clicking on the button <span class="menu-command">Insert new stop</span> in the gradient 
tool's tool bar at the top. Drag the new stop a bit. Then add more stops before and after the 
middle stop and drag them too, so that the gradient looks smooth. The more stops you add, the 
smoother you can make the resulting gradient. Here's the initial black-white gradient with two 
stops:
</p>

<img src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f04-en.svg.png" alt="An example image"/>

<p>
And here are various “non-linear” multi-stop gradients (examine them in the Gradient
Editor):
</p>

<img src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f05-en.svg.png" alt="An example image"/>



<h2>Excentric radial gradients</h2>
<p>
Radial gradients don't have to be symmetric. In Gradient tool, drag the central handle
of an elliptic gradient with <kbd>Shift</kbd>. This will move the x-shaped
<span class="firstterm">focus handle</span> of the gradient away from its center. When you don't
need it, you can snap the focus back by dragging it close to the center.
</p>

<img src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f06-en.svg.png" alt="An example image"/>



<h2>Aligning to the center of the page</h2>
<p>
To align something to the center or side of a page, select the object or group and then
choose <span class="menu-command">Page</span> from the <span class="menu-command">Relative to:</span> list in the
Align and Distribute dialog (<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+A</kbd>). 
</p>



<h2>Cleaning up the document</h2>
<p>
Many of the no-longer-used gradients, patterns, and markers (more precisely, those which
you edited manually) remain in the corresponding palettes and can be reused for new
objects. However if you want to optimize your document, use the <span class="menu-command">Clean up Document</span> command in File menu. It will remove any gradients, patterns, or markers
which are not used by anything in the document, making the file smaller.
</p>



<h2>Hidden features and the XML editor</h2>
<p>
The XML editor (<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+X</kbd>) allows you to change almost all aspects
of the document without using an external text editor. Also, Inkscape usually supports
more SVG features than are accessible from the GUI. The XML editor is one way to get
access to these features (if you know SVG).
</p>



<h2>Changing the rulers' unit of measure</h2>
<p>
In the default template, the unit of measure used by the rulers is mm. This is also the unit used in
displaying coordinates at the lower-left corner and preselected in all units menus. (You
can always hover your mouse over a ruler to see the tooltip with the units it uses.) To
change this, open <span class="menu-command">Document Properties</span>
(<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+D</kbd>) and change the <span class="menu-command">Display units</span> on the
<span class="menu-command">Page</span> tab.
</p>



<h2>Stamping</h2>
<p>
To quickly create many copies of an object, use <span class="firstterm">stamping</span>. Just
drag an object (or scale or rotate it), and while holding the mouse button down, press
<kbd>Space</kbd>. This leaves a “stamp” of the current object shape. You can
repeat it as many times as you wish.
</p>



<h2>Pen tool tricks</h2>
<p>
In the Pen (Bezier) tool, you have the following options to finish the current line:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>      <p>
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
      </p>   </li>
   <li>      <p>
Double click with the left mouse button
</p>   </li>
   <li>      <p>
Click with the right mouse button
</p>   </li>
   <li>      <p>
Select another tool 
</p>   </li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that while the path is unfinished (i.e. is shown green, with the current segment
red) it does not yet exist as an object in the document. Therefore, to cancel it, use
either <kbd>Esc</kbd> (cancel the whole path) or <kbd>Backspace</kbd>
(remove the last segment of the unfinished path) instead of <span class="menu-command">Undo</span>.
</p>

<p>
To add a new subpath to an existing path, select that path and start drawing with
<kbd>Shift</kbd> from an arbitrary point. If, however, what you want is to simply
<em>continue</em> an existing path, Shift is not necessary; just start
drawing from one of the end anchors of the selected path.
</p>



<h2>Entering Unicode values</h2>
<p>
While in the Text tool, pressing <kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd> toggles between Unicode and
normal mode. In Unicode mode, each group of 4 hexadecimal digits you type becomes a
single Unicode character, thus allowing you to enter arbitrary symbols (as long as you
know their Unicode codepoints and the font supports them). To finish the Unicode input, 
press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. For example, <kbd>Ctrl+U 2 0 1 4 Enter</kbd> inserts
an em-dash (—). To quit the Unicode mode without inserting anything press
<kbd>Esc</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
You can also use the <span class="menu-command">Text &gt; Glyphs</span> dialog to search for and insert 
glyphs into your document.
</p>



<h2>Using the grid for drawing icons</h2>
<p>
Suppose you want to create a 24x24 pixel icon. Create a 24x24 px canvas (use the
<span class="menu-command">Document Preferences</span>) and set the grid to 0.5 px (48x48 gridlines).
Now, if you align filled objects to <em>even</em> gridlines, and stroked
objects to <em>odd</em> gridlines with the stroke width in px being an even
number, and export it at the default 96dpi (so that 1 px becomes 1 bitmap pixel), you
get a crisp bitmap image without unneeded antialiasing.
</p>



<h2>Object rotation</h2>
<p>
When in the Selector tool, <kbd>click</kbd> on an object to see the scaling arrows,
then <kbd>click again</kbd> on the object to see the rotation and skew arrows. If
the arrows at the corners are clicked and dragged, the object will rotate around the
center (shown as a cross mark). If you hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while
doing this, the rotation will occur around the opposite corner. You can also drag the
rotation center to any place.
</p>

<p>
Or, you can rotate from keyboard by pressing <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd>
(by 15 degrees) or <kbd>Ctrl+[</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+]</kbd> (by 90
degrees). The same <kbd>[]</kbd> keys with <kbd>Alt</kbd> perform slow
pixel-size rotation.
</p>



<h2>Drop shadows</h2>
<p>
To quickly create drop shadows for objects, use the 
<span class="menu-command">Filters &gt; Shadows and Glows &gt; Drop Shadow...</span> feature.
</p>
<p>
You can also easily create blurred drop shadows for objects manually with blur in the
Fill and Stroke dialog. Select an object, duplicate it by <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>, press 
<kbd>PgDown</kbd> to put it beneath original object, place it a little to the right 
and lower than original object. Now open Fill And Stroke dialog and change Blur value to, 
say, 5.0. That's it!
</p>



<h2>Placing text on a path</h2>
<p>
To place text along a curve, select the text and the curve together and choose
<span class="menu-command">Put on Path</span> from the Text menu. The text will start at the beginning
of the path. In general it is best to create an explicit path that you want the text to
be fitted to, rather than fitting it to some other drawing element — this will give you
more control without screwing over your drawing.
</p>



<h2>Selecting the original</h2>
<p>
When you have a text on path, a linked offset, or a clone, their source object/path may
be difficult to select because it may be directly underneath, or made invisible and/or
locked. The magic key <kbd>Shift+D</kbd> will help you; select the text, linked
offset, or clone, and press <kbd>Shift+D</kbd> to move selection to the
corresponding path, offset source, or clone original.
</p>



<h2>Window off-screen recovery</h2>
<p>
When moving documents between systems with different resolutions or number of displays,
you may find Inkscape has saved a window position that places the window out of reach on
your screen. Simply maximise the window (which will bring it back into view, use the
task bar), save and reload. You can avoid this altogether by unchecking the global
option to save window geometry (<span class="menu-command">Inkscape Preferences</span>,
<span class="menu-command">Interface &gt; Windows</span> section).

<h2>Transparency, gradients, and PostScript export</h2>
<p>
PostScript or EPS formats do not support <em>transparency</em>, so you
should never use it if you are going to export to PS/EPS. In the case of flat
transparency which overlays flat color, it's easy to fix it: Select one of the
transparent objects; switch to the Dropper tool (<kbd>F7</kbd> or <kbd>d</kbd>); 
make sure that the <span class="menu-command">Opacity: Pick</span> button in the dropper tool's tool bar 
is deactivated; click on that same object. That will pick
the visible color and assign it back to the object, but this time without
transparency. Repeat for all transparent objects. If your transparent object overlays
several flat color areas, you will need to break it correspondingly into pieces and
apply this procedure to each piece. Note that the dropper tool does not change the opacity 
value of the object, but only the alpha value of its fill or stroke color, so make sure that 
every object's opacity value is set to 100% before you start out.
