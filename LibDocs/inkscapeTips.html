<h2>Moving, scaling, rotating</h2>
Selector
the arrow on the toolbar, or press <b class="red">F1 or Space</b>

Move the object by dragging it. 

(Press <u class="red">Ctrl to restrict movement</u> to horizontal and vertical.)

Scale the object by dragging any handle. 

(Press <u class="red">Ctrl to preserve the original height/width ratio</u>.)

Rotate the object by dragging corner handles. 

(Press <u class="red">Ctrl to restrict rotation to 15 degree steps</u>. 

Drag the cross mark to position the center of rotation.)

Skew (shear) the object by dragging non-corner handles. 

(Press Ctrl to restrict skewing to 15 degree steps.)

While in Selector, you can also <u class="red">use the numeric entry fields</u> in the Controls bar (above the canvas) to set exact values for coordinates (X and Y) and size (W and H) of the selection.

Transforming by keys
One of Inkscape's features that set it apart from most other vector editors is its emphasis on keyboard accessibility. 

There's hardly any command or action that is impossible to do from keyboard, and transforming objects is no exception.

You can use the keyboard <b class="red">to move (arrow keys), scale (< and > keys), and rotate ([ and ] keys)</b> objects. 

Default moves and scales are by 2 px; <b class="red">with Shift</b>, you move by 10 times that. 

<b class="red">Ctrl+> and Ctrl+< scale up or down to 200% or 50%</b> of the original, respectively. 

Default rotates are by 15 degrees; with Ctrl, you rotate by 90 degrees.

However, perhaps the most useful are <b class="red">pixel-size transformations, invoked by using Alt</b> with the transform keys. 

For example, Alt+arrows will move the selection by 1 pixel at the current zoom (i.e. by 1 screen pixel, not to be confused with the px unit which is an SVG length unit independent of zoom). 

This means that if you zoom in, one <b class="red">Alt+arrow</b> will result in a smaller absolute movement which will still look like <b class="red">one-pixel nudge</b> on your screen. 

It is thus possible to position objects with arbitrary precision simply by zooming in or out as needed.

Similarly, Alt+> and Alt+< scale selection so that its visible size changes by one screen pixel, and Alt+[ and Alt+] rotate it so that its farthest-from-center point moves by one screen pixel.

Note: Linux users may not get the expected results with the Alt+arrow and a few other key combinations if their Window Manager catches those key events before they reach the inkscape application. 

One solution would be to change the WM's configuration accordingly.

Multiple selections
You can select any number of objects simultaneously by Shift+clicking them. 

Or, you can drag around the objects you need to select; this is called rubberband selection. 

(Selector creates rubberband when dragging from an empty space; however, if you press Shift before starting to drag, Inkscape will always create the rubberband.) Practice by selecting all three of the shapes below:


Grouping
Several objects can be combined into a group. 

To create a group, you select one or more objects and press <b class="red">Ctrl+G</b>. 

To ungroup one or more groups, select them and press <b class="red">Ctrl+U</b>. 


However, Ctrl+U only ungroups the topmost level of grouping in a selection; you'll need to press Ctrl+U repeatedly if you want to completely ungroup a deep group-in-group.

You don't necessarily have to ungroup, however, if you want to edit an object within a group. 

Just <b class="red">Ctrl+click</b> that object and it will be selected and editable alone, or Shift+Ctrl+click several objects (inside or outside any groups) for multiple selection regardless of grouping. 

Fill and stroke
Probably the simplest way to paint an object some color is to select an object, and <b class="red">click a swatch in the palette</b> below the canvas to paint it (change its fill color). 

Alternatively, you can open the Swatches dialog from the View menu (or press <b class="red">Shift+Ctrl+W</b>), select an object, and click a swatch to paint it (change its fill color).

More powerful is the Fill and Stroke dialog from the Object menu (or press <b class="red">Shift+Ctrl+F</b>). 

Yet another convenient way to change a color of an object is by using the Dropper tool (<b class="red">F7</b>). 

Just click anywhere in the drawing with that tool, and the picked color will be assigned to the selected object's fill (Shift+click will assign stroke color).

Duplication, alignment, distribution
One of the most common operations is duplicating an object (Ctrl+D). 

The duplicate is placed exactly above the original and is selected, so you can drag it away by mouse or by arrow keys. 

For practice, try to fill the line with copies of this black square:

An example image
Chances are, your copies of the square are placed more or less randomly. 

This is where the Align and Distribute dialog (Shift+Ctrl+A) is useful. 

Select all the squares (Shift+click or drag a rubberband), open the dialog and press the “Center on horizontal axis” button, then the “Make horizontal gaps between objects equal” button (read the button tooltips). 

The objects are now neatly aligned and distributed equispacedly. 

Here are some other alignment and distribution examples:

An example image
Z-order
The term z-order refers to the stacking order of objects in a drawing, i.e. to which objects are on top and obscure others. 

The two commands in the Object menu, Raise to Top (the Home key) and Lower to Bottom (the End key), will move your selected objects to the very top or very bottom of the current layer's z-order. 

Two more commands, Raise (PgUp) and Lower (PgDn), will sink or emerge the selection one step only, i.e. move it past one non-selected object in z-order (only objects that overlap the selection count, based on their respective bounding boxes).

Practice using these commands by reversing the z-order of the objects below, so that the leftmost ellipse is on top and the rightmost one is at the bottom:

An example image
A very useful selection shortcut is the Tab key. 

If nothing is selected, it selects the bottommost object; otherwise it selects the object above the selected object(s) in z-order. 

Shift+Tab works in reverse, starting from the topmost object and proceeding downwards. 

Since the objects you create are added to the top of the stack, pressing Shift+Tab with nothing selected will conveniently select the object you created last. 

Practice the Tab and Shift+Tab keys on the stack of ellipses above.

Selecting under and dragging selected
What to do if the object you need is hidden behind another object? You may still see the bottom object if the top one is (partially) transparent, but clicking on it will select the top object, not the one you need.

This is what Alt+click is for. 

First Alt+click selects the top object just like the regular click. 

However, the next Alt+click at the same point will select the object below the top one; the next one, the object still lower, etc. 

Thus, several Alt+clicks in a row will cycle, top-to-bottom, through the entire z-order stack of objects at the click point. 

When the bottom object is reached, next Alt+click will, naturally, again select the topmost object.

[If you are on Linux, you might find that Alt+click does not work properly. 

Instead, it might be moving the whole Inkscape window. 

This is because your window manager has reserved Alt+click for a different action. 

The way to fix this is to find the Window Behavior configuration for your window manager, and either turn it off, or map it to use the Meta key (aka Windows key), so Inkscape and other applications may use the Alt key freely.]

This is nice, but once you selected an under-the-surface object, what can you do with it? You can use keys to transform it, and you can drag the selection handles. 

However, dragging the object itself will reset the selection to the top object again (this is how click-and-drag is designed to work — it selects the (top) object under cursor first, then drags the selection). 

To tell Inkscape to drag what is selected now without selecting anything else, use Alt+drag. 

This will move the current selection no matter where you drag your mouse.

Practice Alt+click and Alt+drag on the two brown shapes under the green transparent rectangle:

An example image
Selecting similar objects
Inkscape can select other objects similar to the object currently selected. 

For example, if you want to select all the blue squares below first select one of the blue squares, and use Edit > Select Same > Fill Color from the menu. 

All the objects with a fill color the same shade of blue are now selected.

An example image
In addition to selecting by fill color, you can select multiple similar objects by stroke color, stroke style, fill & stroke, and object type.

<h2>Create Tiled Clones</h2>
Edit > Clone > Create Tiled Clones

<h2>Radial placement with Tiled Clones</h2>
It's easy to see how to use the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Create Tiled Clones</samp></kbd> dialog for rectangular grids and patterns. 
But what if you need <span class="firstterm">radial</span> placement, where objects share a common center of rotation? It's possible too!  If your radial pattern only needs to have 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 elements, then you can try the P3, P31M, P3M1, P4, P4M, P6, or P6M symmetries. 
These will work nicely for snowflakes and the like. 
A more general method, however, is as follows. 
Choose the P1 symmetry (simple translation) and then <em>compensate</em> for that translation by going to the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Shift</samp></kbd> tab and setting <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>Per row/Shift Y</samp></kbd> and <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>Per column/Shift X</samp></kbd> both to -100%. 
Now all clones will be stacked exactly on top of the original. 
All that remains to do is to go to the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Rotation</samp></kbd> tab and set some rotation angle per column, then create the pattern with one row and multiple columns. 
For example, here's a pattern made out of a horizontal line, with 30 columns, each column rotated 6 degrees:  <object data="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f01.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
 To get a clock dial out of this, all you need to do is cut out or simply overlay the central part by a white circle (to do boolean operations on clones, unlink them first). 
More interesting effects can be created by using both rows and columns. 
Here's a pattern with 10 columns and 8 rows, with rotation of 2 degrees per row and 18 degrees per column. 
Each group of lines here is a “column”, so the groups are 18 degrees from each other; within each column, individual lines are 2 degrees apart:  <object data="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f02.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
 In the above examples, the line was rotated around its center. 
But what if you want the  center to be outside of your shape? Just click on the object twice with the Selector tool  to enter rotation mode. 
Now move the object's rotation center (represented by a small cross-shaped handle)  to the point you would like to be the center of the rotation for the Tiled Clones operation. 
Then use <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Create Tiled Clones</samp></kbd> on the object. 
This is how you can do nice “explosions”  or “starbursts” by randomizing scale, rotation, and possibly opacity:  <object data="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f03.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<h2>How to do slicing (multiple rectangular export areas)?</h2>
Create a new layer, in that layer create invisible rectangles covering parts of your image. 
Make sure your document uses the px unit (default), turn on grid and snap the rects to the grid so that each one spans a whole number of px units. 
Assign meaningful ids to the rects, and export each one to its own file (<kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>File</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Export PNG Image</samp></kbd></kbd> (<kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">E</kbd></kbd>)). 
Then the rects will remember their export filenames. 
After that, it's very easy to re-export some of the rects: switch to the export layer, use <kbd class="tutorial-key">Tab</kbd> to select the one you need (or use Find by id), and click <kbd class="tutorial-guibutton"><samp>Export</samp></kbd> in the dialog. 
Or, you can write a shell script or batch file to export all of your areas, with a command like:  <code class="tutorial-command">inkscape -i area-id -t filename.svg</code>
for each exported area. 
The <code class="tutorial-command">-t</code> switch tells it to use the remembered filename hint, otherwise you can provide the export filename with the <code class="tutorial-command">-e</code> switch. 
Alternatively, you can use the <kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>Extensions</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guisubmenu"><samp>Web</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Slicer</samp></kbd></kbd> extensions, or <kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>Extensions</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guisubmenu"><samp>Export</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Guillotine</samp></kbd></kbd> for similar results. 
<h2>Non-linear gradients</h2>
The version 1.1 of SVG does not support non-linear gradients (i.e. those which have a non-linear translations between colors). 
You can, however, emulate them by <span class="firstterm">multistop</span> gradients. 
Start with a simple two-stop gradient (you can assign that in the Fill and Stroke dialog  or use the gradient tool). 
Now, with the gradient tool, add a new gradient stop in the middle; either by double-clicking on the gradient line, or by selecting the square-shaped  gradient stop and clicking on the button <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Insert new stop</samp></kbd> in the gradient  tool's tool bar at the top. 
Drag the new stop a bit. 
Then add more stops before and after the  middle stop and drag them too, so that the gradient looks smooth. 
The more stops you add, the  smoother you can make the resulting gradient. 
Here's the initial black-white gradient with two  stops:  <object data="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f04.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
 And here are various “non-linear” multi-stop gradients (examine them in the Gradient Editor):  <object data="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f05.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<h2>Excentric radial gradients</h2>
Radial gradients don't have to be symmetric. 
In Gradient tool, drag the central handle of an elliptic gradient with <kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd>. 
This will move the x-shaped <span class="firstterm">focus handle</span> of the gradient away from its center. 
When you don't need it, you can snap the focus back by dragging it close to the center. 
<object data="https://media.inkscape.org/media/doc/tutorials/tips/tips-f06.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<h2>Aligning to the center of the page</h2>
To align something to the center or side of a page, select the object or group and then choose <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Page</samp></kbd> from the <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>Relative to:</samp></kbd> list in the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Align and Distribute</samp></kbd> dialog (<kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">A</kbd></kbd>). 
   <h2>Cleaning up the document</h2>
Many of the no-longer-used gradients, patterns, and markers (more precisely, those which you edited manually) remain in the corresponding palettes and can be reused for new objects. 
However if you want to optimize your document, use the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Clean Up Document</samp></kbd> command in <kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>File</samp></kbd> menu. 
It will remove any gradients, patterns, or markers which are not used by anything in the document, making the file smaller. 
<h2>Hidden features and the XML editor</h2>
The XML editor (<kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">X</kbd></kbd>) allows you to change almost all aspects of the document without using an external text editor. 
Also, Inkscape usually supports more SVG features than are accessible from the GUI. 
The XML editor is one way to get access to these features (if you know SVG). 
<h2>Changing the rulers' unit of measure</h2>
In the default template, the unit of measure used by the rulers is mm. 
This is also the unit used in displaying coordinates at the lower-left corner and preselected in all units menus. 
(You can always hover your <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton ">mouse</kbd> over a ruler to see the tooltip with the units it uses.) To change this, open <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Document Properties</samp></kbd> (<kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">D</kbd></kbd>) and change the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Display units</samp></kbd> on the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Page</samp></kbd> tab. 
<h2>Stamping</h2>
To quickly create many copies of an object, use <span class="firstterm">stamping</span>. 
Just drag an object (or scale or rotate it), and while holding the <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton click">mouse</kbd> button down, press <kbd class="tutorial-key">Space</kbd>. 
This leaves a “stamp” of the current object shape. 
You can repeat it as many times as you wish. 
<h2>Pen tool tricks</h2>
In the Pen (Bezier) tool, you have the following options to finish the current line:  <ul> <li> Press <kbd class="tutorial-key">Enter</kbd> </li> <li> <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton double-click">Double click</kbd> with the left mouse button </li> <li> Click with the <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton right-click">right</kbd> mouse button </li> <li> Select another tool  </li> </ul>
 Note that while the path is unfinished (i.e. is shown green, with the current segment red) it does not yet exist as an object in the document. 
Therefore, to cancel it, use either <kbd class="tutorial-key">Esc</kbd> (cancel the whole path) or <kbd class="tutorial-key">Backspace</kbd> (remove the last segment of the unfinished path) instead of <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Undo</samp></kbd>. 
 To add a new subpath to an existing path, select that path and start drawing with <kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd> from an arbitrary point. 
If, however, what you want is to simply <em>continue</em> an existing path, Shift is not necessary; just start drawing from one of the end anchors of the selected path. 
<h2>Entering Unicode values</h2>
While in the Text tool, pressing <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">U</kbd></kbd> toggles between Unicode and normal mode. 
In Unicode mode, each group of 4 hexadecimal digits you type becomes a single Unicode character, thus allowing you to enter arbitrary symbols (as long as you know their Unicode codepoints and the font supports them). 
To finish the Unicode input,  press <kbd class="tutorial-key">Enter</kbd>. 
For example, <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">U</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">2</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">0</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">1</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">4</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">Enter</kbd></kbd> inserts an em-dash (—). 
To quit the Unicode mode without inserting anything press <kbd class="tutorial-key">Esc</kbd>. 
You can also use the <kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>Text</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Unicode Characters</samp></kbd></kbd> dialog to search for and insert glyphs into your document. 
<h2>Using the grid for drawing icons</h2>
Suppose you want to create a 24x24 pixel icon. 
Create a 24x24 px canvas (use the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Document Preferences</samp></kbd>) and set the grid to 0.5 px (48x48 gridlines). 
Now, if you align filled objects to <em>even</em> gridlines, and stroked objects to <em>odd</em> gridlines with the stroke width in px being an even number, and export it at the default 96dpi (so that 1 px becomes 1 bitmap pixel), you get a crisp bitmap image without unneeded antialiasing. 
<h2>Object rotation</h2>
When in the Selector tool, <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton click">click</kbd> on an object to see the scaling arrows, then <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton click">click</kbd> again on the object to see the rotation and skew arrows. 
If the arrows at the corners are clicked and dragged, the object will rotate around the center (shown as a cross mark). 
If you hold down the <kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd> key while doing this, the rotation will occur around the opposite corner. 
You can also drag the rotation center to any place. 
 Or, you can rotate from keyboard by pressing <kbd class="tutorial-key">[</kbd> and <kbd class="tutorial-key">]</kbd> (by 15 degrees) or <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">[</kbd></kbd> and <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">]</kbd></kbd> (by 90 degrees). 
The same <kbd class="tutorial-key">[</kbd> <kbd class="tutorial-key">]</kbd> keys with <kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Alt</kbd> perform slow pixel-size rotation. 
<h2>Drop shadows</h2>
To quickly create drop shadows for objects, use the  <kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>Filters</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guisubmenu"><samp>Shadows and Glows</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Drop Shadow</samp></kbd></kbd> feature. 
You can also easily create blurred drop shadows for objects manually with blur in the Fill and Stroke dialog. 
Select an object, duplicate it by <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">D</kbd></kbd>, press  <kbd class="tutorial-key">PgDown</kbd> to put it beneath original object, place it a little to the right  and lower than original object. 
Now open Fill And Stroke dialog and change Blur value to,  say, 5.0. 
That's it!    <h2>Placing text on a path</h2>
To place text along a curve, select the text and the curve together and choose <kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Put on Path</samp></kbd> from the <kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>Text</samp></kbd> menu. 
The text will start at the beginning of the path. 
In general it is best to create an explicit path that you want the text to be fitted to, rather than fitting it to some other drawing element — this will give you more control without screwing over your drawing. 
<h2>Selecting the original</h2>
When you have a text on path, a linked offset, or a clone, their source object/path may be difficult to select because it may be directly underneath, or made invisible and/or locked. 
The magic key <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">D</kbd></kbd> will help you; select the text, linked offset, or clone, and press <kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">D</kbd></kbd> to move selection to the corresponding path, offset source, or clone original. 
<h2>Window off-screen recovery</h2>
When moving documents between systems with different resolutions or number of displays, you may find Inkscape has saved a window position that places the window out of reach on your screen. 
Simply maximise the window (which will bring it back into view, use the task bar), save and reload. 
You can avoid this altogether by unchecking the global option to save window geometry (<kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Inkscape Preferences</samp></kbd>, <kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenu"><samp>Interface</samp></kbd><span class="tutorial-arrowsign">⇒</span><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Windows</samp></kbd></kbd> section). 
<h2>Transparency, gradients, and PostScript export</h2>
PostScript or EPS formats do not support <em>transparency</em>, so you should never use it if you are going to export to PS/EPS. 
In the case of flat transparency which overlays flat color, it's easy to fix it: Select one of the transparent objects; switch to the Dropper tool (<kbd class="tutorial-key">F7</kbd> or <kbd class="tutorial-key">d</kbd>);  make sure that the <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>Opacity: Pick</samp></kbd> button in the dropper tool's tool bar  is deactivated; click on that same object. 
That will pick the visible color and assign it back to the object, but this time without transparency. 
Repeat for all transparent objects. 
If your transparent object overlays several flat color areas, you will need to break it correspondingly into pieces and apply this procedure to each piece. 
Note that the dropper tool does not change the opacity  value of the object, but only the alpha value of its fill or stroke color, so make sure that  every object's opacity value is set to 100% before you start out. 
<h2>Interactivity</h2> Most SVG elements can be tweaked to react to user input (usually this will only work if the SVG is displayed in a web browser).
The simplest possibility is to add a clickable link to objects. 
For this <kbd class="tutorial-mousebutton right-click">right-click</kbd> the object and select <kbd class="tutorial-menuchoice"><kbd class="tutorial-guimenuitem"><samp>Create Link</samp></kbd></kbd> from the context menu. 
The "Object attributes" dialog will open, where you can set the target of the link using the value of <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>href</samp></kbd>.
More control is possible using the interactivity attributes accessible from the "Object Properties" dialog (<kbd class="tutorial-keycombo"><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Ctrl</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-modifierkey">Shift</kbd><span class="tutorial-plussign">+</span><kbd class="tutorial-key">O</kbd></kbd>). 
Here you can implement arbitrary functionality using JavaScript. 
Some basic examples:
Open another file in the current window when clicking on the object:
<li>Set <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>onclick</samp></kbd> to <code class="tutorial-code">window.location='file2.svg';</code></li>
Open an arbitrary weblink in new window when clicking on the object:

Set <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>onclick</samp></kbd> to <code class="tutorial-code">window.open("https://inkscape.org","_blank");</code>

Reduce transparency of the object while hovering:
Set <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>onmouseover</samp></kbd> to <code class="tutorial-code">style.opacity = 0.5;</code>
Set <kbd class="tutorial-guilabel"><samp>onmouseout</samp></kbd> to <code class="tutorial-code">style.opacity = 1;</code>
