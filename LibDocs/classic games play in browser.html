<a href=https://archive.org/ >Archive.org</a> is an incredible resource that has saved countless pieces of media from being lost to time. Essentially a library of the old internet, the website has made wide collections of art, movies, and music available to anyone with access to a computer and internet connection. <br>

Last year, over 2,400 old-school games were added to the media collection, and they're all playable right from within your web browser. Below are some of the most beloved games from an era before the internet, a time before the wide adoption of computers with graphic interfaces. <br>

Sure, the controls are a little clunky, but it beats having to keep track of a floppy disk. <br>

<h2>"The Oregon Trail"</h2>

<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c660008b804f-960-540.png">
<br>
 One of the first video games that was widely played, <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990 >
"Oregon Trail" introduced many children in the 20th century</a>
 to the idea of traveling in the wilderness, and the word "dysentery." <br>


<h2>"Prince of Persia"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c625048b8016-960-540.png">
<br>
A far cry from current entries in the franchise, the original "Prince of Persia" represents <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Prince_of_Persia_1990 >
old-school platforming at its finest.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Sim City"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c619008b8010-960-540.png">
<br>
One of the first games that essentially let you play God, "Sim City" gave you the reins to a city. <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_SimCity_1989 >
Build it up, destroy it &mdash; the choice is yours.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Super Street Fighter II"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd2e5265ba008b7f72-960-540.png">
<br>
The fourth installment in the Street Fighter II series &mdash; yes, there were enough versions to constitute it as a series &mdash; <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Super_Street_Fighter_II_1996 >
"Super Street Fighter II" was packed with additional content</a>
, including more fighters than the original. <br>


<h2>"Ms. Pac-Man"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd2e526556008b7fee-960-540.png">
<br>
Way more technically advanced when compared to the original, "Ms. Pac-Man" has completely <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Ms._Pac-Man_1983 >
random ghost paths, which require fast reflexes to outsmart.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Tetris"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c62f008b8060-960-540.png">
<br>
"Tetris" was the killer app for the original Game Boy, but players had spent a number of years <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Tetris_1987 >
breaking bricks at home before that.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Maniac Mansion"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c662008b80ab-960-540.png">
<br>
One of the classic Lucasfilm adventure games, Ron Gilbert's masterpiece is brutally hard by today's standards, <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Maniac_Mansion_1987 >
but worth playing.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Donkey Kong"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c686008b8037-960-540.png">
<br>
The first game to feature Mario &mdash; er, Jump Man &mdash; Donkey Kong was an arcade classic, so it's no wonder why it was <a href=https://archive.org/details/a2_Donkey_Kong_1983_Atari >
eventually ported to DOS in 1983.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Manhattan Missions"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c623008b809b-960-540.png">
<br>
Making the jump from comic book to cartoon to video game, <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_-_Manhattan_Missions_1991 >
 "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" made its game debut here</a>
, although it infamously has an impossible jump in this version. <br>


<h2>"Bubble Bobble"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c61e048b803e-960-540.png">
<br>
Shoot enemies, collect fruit and diamonds, and <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Bubble_Bobble_1988 >
pop bubbles in this classic puzzle game.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Gauntlet"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c622048b8022-960-540.png">
<br>
Grab an ax, staff, or sword and <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Gauntlet_1988 >
cut down your foes in "Gauntlet,"</a>
 one of the first action role-playing games (RPGs) ever released. <br>


<h2>"Mega Man"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd6e97c62e008b80c6-960-540.png">
<br>
Like "Donkey Kong," many associate "Mega Man" with their original Nintendo systems, but almost every title also came out for Windows <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Mega_Man_1990 >
or, in this case, DOS.</a>
<br>


<h2>"Ultima VI: The False Prophet"</h2>
<img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56c5fdfd2e5265bc008b7f9f-960-540.png">
<br>
If RPGs are your thing, <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Ultima_VI_-_The_False_Prophet_1990 >
 "Ultima VI" will provide hours of entertainment,</a>
 provided you keep your browser window open long enough to complete it. <br>
