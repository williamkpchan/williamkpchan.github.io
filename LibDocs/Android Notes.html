對於一些安卓手機自帶系統軟件，自己不能關閉【自動開機】，這時候就需要靠刷機（root）來解決。

清除DALVIK緩存
如果方法不管用，99%是Dalvik緩存惹的禍。
Dalvik緩存是啥呢？
Dalvik緩存，簡單說就是系統里普通刪除，去不掉的緩存垃圾。
我們在反覆安裝、卸載軟件時，會產生緩存，這些文件查看不到，而且並不會隨着軟件的卸載一起被清除，還會自動後台運行。
日積月累，這樣手機有限的內存慢慢被無形地佔用，越來越慢，甚至不夠用。

這時候就要用到【RE管理器】，不過前提是手機必須刷機（Root）。

<h2>Android Input events overview</h2>
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/ui-events" class="whitebut ">Android Input events overview</a>

On Android, there's more than one way to intercept the events from a user's interaction with your application. 
When considering events within your user interface, the approach is to capture the events from the specific View object that the user interacts with. 
The View class provides the means to do so.

Within the various View classes that you'll use to compose your layout, you may notice several public callback methods that look useful for UI events. 
These methods are called by the Android framework when the respective action occurs on that object. 
For instance, when a View (such as a Button) is touched, the onTouchEvent() method is called on that object. 
However, in order to intercept this, you must extend the class and override the method. 
However, extending every View object in order to handle such an event would not be practical. 
This is why the View class also contains a collection of nested interfaces with callbacks that you can much more easily define. 
These interfaces, called event listeners, are your ticket to capturing the user interaction with your UI.

While you will more commonly use the event listeners to listen for user interaction, there may come a time when you do want to extend a View class, in order to build a custom component. 
Perhaps you want to extend the Button class to make something more fancy. 
In this case, you'll be able to define the default event behaviors for your class using the class event handlers.

Event listeners
An event listener is an interface in the View class that contains a single callback method. 
These methods will be called by the Android framework when the View to which the listener has been registered is triggered by user interaction with the item in the UI.

Included in the event listener interfaces are the following callback methods:

onClick()
From View.OnClickListener. 
This is called when the user either touches the item (when in touch mode), or focuses upon the item with the navigation-keys or trackball and presses the suitable "enter" key or presses down on the trackball.

onLongClick()
From View.OnLongClickListener. 
This is called when the user either touches and holds the item (when in touch mode), or focuses upon the item with the navigation-keys or trackball and presses and holds the suitable "enter" key or presses and holds down on the trackball (for one second).

onFocusChange()
From View.OnFocusChangeListener. 
This is called when the user navigates onto or away from the item, using the navigation-keys or trackball.

onKey()
From View.OnKeyListener. 
This is called when the user is focused on the item and presses or releases a hardware key on the device.

onTouch()
From View.OnTouchListener. 
This is called when the user performs an action qualified as a touch event, including a press, a release, or any movement gesture on the screen (within the bounds of the item).

onCreateContextMenu()
From View.OnCreateContextMenuListener. 
This is called when a Context Menu is being built (as the result of a sustained "long click"). 
See the discussion on context menus in the Menus developer guide.
These methods are the sole inhabitants of their respective interface. 
To define one of these methods and handle your events, implement the nested interface in your Activity or define it as an anonymous class. 
Then, pass an instance of your implementation to the respective View.set...Listener() method. 
(E.g., call setOnClickListener() and pass it your implementation of the OnClickListener.)

The example below shows how to register an on-click listener for a Button.

KOTLIN
JAVA
protected void onCreate(savedValues: Bundle) {
    ...
    val button: Button = findViewById(R.id.corky)
    // Register the onClick listener with the implementation above
    button.setOnClickListener { view ->
        // do something when the button is clicked
    }
    ...
}

You may also find it more convenient to implement OnClickListener as a part of your Activity. 
This will avoid the extra class load and object allocation. 
For example:

KOTLIN
JAVA
class ExampleActivity : Activity(), OnClickListener {
  
    protected fun onCreate(savedValues: Bundle) {
        val button: Button = findViewById(R.id.corky)
        button.setOnClickListener(this)
    }

    // Implement the OnClickListener callback
    fun onClick(v: View) {
        // do something when the button is clicked
    }
}

Notice that the onClick() callback in the above example has no return value, but some other event listener methods must return a boolean. 
The reason depends on the event. 
For the few that do, here's why:

onLongClick() - This returns a boolean to indicate whether you have consumed the event and it should not be carried further. 
That is, return true to indicate that you have handled the event and it should stop here; return false if you have not handled it and/or the event should continue to any other on-click listeners.

onKey() - This returns a boolean to indicate whether you have consumed the event and it should not be carried further. 
That is, return true to indicate that you have handled the event and it should stop here; return false if you have not handled it and/or the event should continue to any other on-key listeners.

onTouch() - This returns a boolean to indicate whether your listener consumes this event. 
The important thing is that this event can have multiple actions that follow each other. 
So, if you return false when the down action event is received, you indicate that you have not consumed the event and are also not interested in subsequent actions from this event. 
Thus, you will not be called for any other actions within the event, such as a finger gesture, or the eventual up action event.
Remember that hardware key events are always delivered to the View currently in focus. 
They are dispatched starting from the top of the View hierarchy, and then down, until they reach the appropriate destination. 
If your View (or a child of your View) currently has focus, then you can see the event travel through the dispatchKeyEvent() method. 
As an alternative to capturing key events through your View, you can also receive all of the events inside your Activity with onKeyDown() and onKeyUp().

Also, when thinking about text input for your application, remember that many devices only have software input methods. 
Such methods are not required to be key-based; some may use voice input, handwriting, and so on. 
Even if an input method presents a keyboard-like interface, it will generally not trigger the onKeyDown() family of events. 
You should never build a UI that requires specific key presses to be controlled unless you want to limit your application to devices with a hardware keyboard. 
In particular, do not rely on these methods to validate input when the user presses the return key; instead, use actions like IME_ACTION_DONE to signal the input method how your application expects to react, so it may change its UI in a meaningful way. 
Avoid assumptions about how a software input method should work and just trust it to supply already formatted text to your application.

Note: Android will call event handlers first and then the appropriate default handlers from the class definition second. 
As such, returning true from these event listeners will stop the propagation of the event to other event listeners and will also block the callback to the default event handler in the View. 
So be certain that you want to terminate the event when you return true.

Event handlers
If you're building a custom component from View, then you'll be able to define several callback methods used as default event handlers. 
In the document about Custom View Components, you'll learn some of the common callbacks used for event handling, including:

onKeyDown(int, KeyEvent) - Called when a new key event occurs.
onKeyUp(int, KeyEvent) - Called when a key up event occurs.
onTrackballEvent(MotionEvent) - Called when a trackball motion event occurs.
onTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - Called when a touch screen motion event occurs.
onFocusChanged(boolean, int, Rect) - Called when the view gains or loses focus.
There are some other methods that you should be aware of, which are not part of the View class, but can directly impact the way you're able to handle events. 
So, when managing more complex events inside a layout, consider these other methods:

Activity.dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows your Activity to intercept all touch events before they are dispatched to the window.
ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows a ViewGroup to watch events as they are dispatched to child Views.
ViewParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(boolean) - Call this upon a parent View to indicate that it should not intercept touch events with onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent).
Touch mode
When a user is navigating a user interface with directional keys or a trackball, it is necessary to give focus to actionable items (like buttons) so the user can see what will accept input. 
If the device has touch capabilities, however, and the user begins interacting with the interface by touching it, then it is no longer necessary to highlight items, or give focus to a particular View. 
Thus, there is a mode for interaction named "touch mode."

For a touch-capable device, once the user touches the screen, the device will enter touch mode. 
From this point onward, only Views for which isFocusableInTouchMode() is true will be focusable, such as text editing widgets. 
Other Views that are touchable, like buttons, will not take focus when touched; they will simply fire their on-click listeners when pressed.

Any time a user hits a directional key or scrolls with a trackball, the device will exit touch mode, and find a view to take focus. 
Now, the user may resume interacting with the user interface without touching the screen.

The touch mode state is maintained throughout the entire system (all windows and activities). 
To query the current state, you can call isInTouchMode() to see whether the device is currently in touch mode.

Handling focus
The framework will handle routine focus movement in response to user input. 
This includes changing the focus as Views are removed or hidden, or as new Views become available. 
Views indicate their willingness to take focus through the isFocusable() method. 
To change whether a View can take focus, call setFocusable(). 
When in touch mode, you may query whether a View allows focus with isFocusableInTouchMode(). 
You can change this with setFocusableInTouchMode().

On devices running Android 9 (API level 28) or higher, activities don't assign an initial focus. 
Instead, you must explicitly request initial focus, if desired.

Focus movement is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. 
In rare cases, the default algorithm may not match the intended behavior of the developer. 
In these situations, you can provide explicit overrides with the following XML attributes in the layout file: nextFocusDown, nextFocusLeft, nextFocusRight, and nextFocusUp. 
Add one of these attributes to the View from which the focus is leaving. 
Define the value of the attribute to be the id of the View to which focus should be given. 
For example:

&lt;LinearLayout
    android:orientation="vertical"
    ... 
>
  &lt;Button android:id="@+id/top"
          android:nextFocusUp="@+id/bottom"
          ... 
/>
  &lt;Button android:id="@+id/bottom"
          android:nextFocusDown="@+id/top"
          ... 
/>
&lt;/LinearLayout>

Ordinarily, in this vertical layout, navigating up from the first Button would not go anywhere, nor would navigating down from the second Button. 
Now that the top Button has defined the bottom one as the nextFocusUp (and vice versa), the navigation focus will cycle from top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top.

If you'd like to declare a View as focusable in your UI (when it is traditionally not), add the android:focusable XML attribute to the View, in your layout declaration. 
Set the value true. 
You can also declare a View as focusable while in Touch Mode with android:focusableInTouchMode.

To request a particular View to take focus, call requestFocus().

To listen for focus events (be notified when a View receives or loses focus), use onFocusChange(), as discussed in the Event listeners section.

<h2>Android - Event Handling</h2>
<b>Events are a useful way to collect data about a user's interaction with interactive components of Applications.</b>
Like button presses or screen touch etc. 
The Android framework maintains an event queue as first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. 
You can capture these events in your program and take appropriate action as per requirements.
There are following three concepts related to Android Event Management &minus;
<ul><li><b>Event Listeners</b> &minus; An event listener is an interface in the View class that contains a single callback method. 
These methods will be called by the Android framework when the View to which the listener has been registered is triggered by user interaction with the item in the UI.
</li><li><b>Event Listeners Registration </b> &minus; Event Registration is the process by which an Event Handler gets registered with an Event Listener so that the handler is called when the Event Listener fires the event.
</li><li><b>Event Handlers</b> &minus; When an event happens and we have registered an event listener for the event, the event listener calls the Event Handlers, which is the method that actually handles the event.
</li>
<h3>Event Listeners &amp; Event Handlers</h3>

</table>
There are many more event listeners available as a part of <b>View</b> class like OnHoverListener, OnDragListener etc which may be needed for your application. 
So I recommend to refer official documentation for Android application development in case you are going to develop a sophisticated apps.
<h3>Event Listeners Registration</h3>
Event Registration is the process by which an Event Handler gets registered with an Event Listener so that the handler is called when the Event Listener fires the event. 
Though there are several tricky ways to register your event listener for any event, but I'm going to list down only top 3 ways, out of which you can use any of them based on the situation.
<ul class="list"><li>Using an Anonymous Inner Class</li><li>Activity class implements the Listener interface.
</li><li>Using Layout file activity_main.xml to specify event handler directly.
</li>
</ul>
Below section will provide you detailed examples on all the three scenarios &minus;
<h3>Touch Mode</h3>
Users can interact with their devices by using hardware keys or buttons or touching the screen.Touching the screen puts the device into touch mode. 
The user can then interact with it by touching the on-screen virtual buttons, images, etc.You can check if the device is in touch mode by calling the View class’s isInTouchMode() method.
<h3>Focus</h3>
A view or widget is usually highlighted or displays a flashing cursor when it’s in focus.
This indicates that it’s ready to accept input from the user.
<ul class="list"><li><b>isFocusable()</b> &minus; it returns true or false
</li><li><b>isFocusableInTouchMode()</b> &minus; checks to see if the view is focusable in touch mode.
(A view may be focusable when using a hardware key but not when the device is in touch mode)
</li>
</ul>
android:foucsUp="@=id/button_l"

<h3>onTouchEvent()</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
public boolean onTouchEvent(motionEvent event){
   switch(event.getAction()){
      case TOUCH_DOWN:
      Toast.makeText(this,"you have clicked down Touch button",Toast.LENTH_LONG).show();
      break();
  
     case TOUCH_UP:      Toast.makeText(this,"you have clicked up touch button",Toast.LENTH_LONG).show();
      break;
  
     case TOUCH_MOVE:
      Toast.makeText(this,"you have clicked move touch button"Toast.LENTH_LONG).show();
      break;
   }
   return super.onTouchEvent(event) ;
}


<h2>Share files with ES File Explorer</h2>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a>, a powerful Android file manager. 
ES File Explorer helps you manage the files on your local Android device. 

Starting with version 3, however, LAN support was added to make it possible to share files with a Windows PC over Wi-Fi. 
To share files between your Android device and a Windows PC using ES File Explorer, follow the steps below:<strong>Step 1</strong>: Create a shared folder on your Windows PC. 
In our example, we'll name it, "Android PC share."  Make sure the permissions are set for read/write access.<strong>Step 2</strong>: In ES File Explorer on your Android device, tap the globe icon in the upper-left hand corner, then navigate to Network &gt; LAN.

<strong>Step 3</strong>: On the menu at the bottom, tap "Search" to look for available network shares on your LAN. 
If you don't see any, make sure that your Android device and the Windows computer are connected to the same local network and try again. 

If successful, you should see your Windows computer listed with its IP address.

<strong>Step 5</strong>: After your shared folder appears, you can begin sharing files back and forth using ES File Explorer.
<img src="" data-original="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/c9uF957YsNhlz-Je4THAhmlrT8g=/2013/05/09/70061912-fdbf-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/ES_File_Explorer-_share_files.png" >
Screenshot by Ed Rhee/CNET

ES File Explorer isn't the only way to share files over Wi-Fi, but it's a popular utility that you're likely to have on your Android device anyway, so you'd might as well give it a try.

<h2>run batch files in Android</h2>
In Linux(Android) it's called a script file, the one with the .sh extension (optional)

On non-rooted device you can run a script on SDcard with sh command:
    adb shell sh path_to_script_on_sdcard/script.sh

without SU permission, just use sh command:
$ cd /sdcard
$ sh helloworld.sh
hello world

For a shell script you can setup Termux or Terminal Emulator in your phone, enable Storage permission for it, launch it and than run the script like this:

sh PATH_TO_FILE
Replace PATH with the path of file under /sdcard. It should work.

To run a compatible binary, move the file from sdcard into Termux's home using:

mv PATH_TO_FILE $HOME
Then verify and enable, using chmod +x $HOME/FILENAME if necessary, the executable permission on that moved file and run it.

You can run the dos batch file using an Android dosbox player. Download afreebox and then run the dos.
In there you can change the file exploring directory to the folder where the batch file is located. And type the batch file name with ending of .bat file.
