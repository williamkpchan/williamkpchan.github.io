In this tutorial <strong>Sassy</strong>, <strong>Sass </strong>and <strong>SCSS </strong>will refer to roughly the same thing. 
Conceptually, there isn’t much difference. 
You will learn the difference as you learn more, but basically <strong>SCSS </strong>is the one most people use now. 
It’s just a more recent (and according to some, superior) version of the original <strong>Sass </strong>syntax.
To start taking primary advantages of <strong>Sass</strong> all you need is just the key points.

They will be explored in this tutorial.

(I tried to be as complete as possible. 
But I am sure there might be a few things missing. 
If you have any feedback post a comment and I’ll update the article.)

<strong>Note: </strong>All Sass/SCSS code compiles back to standard CSS so the browser can actually understand and render the results. 
Browsers currently don’t have direct support for Sass/SCSS or any other CSS pre-processor, nor does the standard CSS specification provide alternatives for similar features (yet.)
<h2>Let’s Begin!</h2>
You can’t really appreciate the power of <strong>Sassy CSS</strong> until you create your first <strong>for-loop</strong> for generating property values and see its advantages. 
But we’ll start from basic SCSS principles and build upon them toward the end.

<strong>What Can Sass/SCSS Do That Vanilla CSS Can’t?</strong>

<strong>1. 
Nested Rules </strong>— Nest your CSS properties within multiple sets of {} brackets. 
This makes your CSS code a bit more clean-looking and more intuitive.

<strong>2. 
Variables </strong>— Standard CSS has variable definitions. 
So what’s the deal? You can do a lot more with Sass variables: iterate them via a <strong>for-loop </strong>and generate property values dynamically. 
You can embed them into CSS property names themselves. 
It’s useful for <strong>property-name-N </strong>{ … } definitions.

<strong>3. 
Better Operators.</strong> You can add, subtract, multiple and divide CSS values. 
Sure the original CSS implements this via <strong>calc()</strong> but In Sass you don’t have to use <strong>calc()</strong> and implementation is slightly more intuitive.

<strong>4. 
Functions</strong> — Sass lets you create CSS definitions as reusable functions.

Speaking of which…

<strong>5. 
Trigonometry </strong>— Among many of its basic features (+, -, *, /) SCSS allows you to write your own <strong>functions</strong>. 
You can write your own sine and cosine (trigonometry) functions entirely using just the Sass/SCSS syntax just like you would in other languages such as JavaScript.

Some trigonometry knowledge will be required. 
But basically, think of <strong>sine </strong>and <strong>cosine</strong> as mathematical values that help us calculate the motion of <strong>circular </strong>progress bars or create animated <strong>wave </strong>effects for example.

<strong>6. 
for-loops, while-loops, if-else statements</strong>. 
You can write CSS using familiar code-flow and control statements similar to another languages. 
But don’t be fooled, Sass still results in standard CSS in the end. 
It only controls <strong>how</strong> property and values were generated. 
It’s not a real-time language. 
Only a pre-processor.

<strong>7. 
Mixins.</strong> Create a set of CSS properties once and reuse them or “mix” together with any new definitions. 
In practice, you can use <strong>mixins </strong>to create separate themes for the same layout, for example.
<h2>Sass Pre-Processor</h2>
Sass is not dynamic. 
You won’t be able to generate or animate CSS properties and values in real-time. 
But you can generate them in a more efficient way and let standard properties (CSS animation for example) pick up from there.
<h2>New Syntax</h2>
SCSS doesn’t really add any new features to CSS language. 
Just new syntax that can in many cases shorten the amount of time spent writing CSS code.

<h3>. Prerequisites</h3>
CSS pre-processors add new features to the syntax of CSS language.

There are 5 CSS pre-processors: <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>SCSS</strong>, <strong>Less</strong>, <strong>Stylus</strong> and <strong>PostCSS</strong>.

This tutorial covers mostly <strong>SCSS</strong> which is similar to <strong>Sass</strong>. 
But you can learn more about <strong>Sass</strong> at <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>www.sass-lang.com</strong></a> website.

<strong>SASS</strong> — (<strong>.sass</strong>) <strong>S</strong>yntactically <strong>A</strong>wesome <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets.

<strong>SCSS</strong> — (<strong>.scss</strong>) <strong>S</strong>assy <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets.

Extensions <strong>.sass</strong> and <strong>.scss</strong> are similar but not the same. 
For command line enthusiasts out there, you can convert from <strong>.sass</strong> to <strong>.scss</strong> and back:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*2nAJtOf5h4JtzUhu.png">

<strong>Figure 1</strong> — Convert files between <strong>.scss</strong> and <strong>.sass</strong> formats using <strong>Sass</strong> pre-processor command <strong>sass-convert.</strong>

<strong>Sass</strong> was the first specification for <strong>Sassy CSS</strong> with file extension .sass}. 
The development started in 2006. 
But later an alternative syntax was developed with extension <strong>.scss</strong> which some developers believe to be a better one.

There is currently no <strong>out-of-the-box</strong> support for <strong>Sassy CSS</strong> in any browser, regardless of which <strong>Sass</strong> syntax or extension you would use. 
But you can openly experiment with any of the 5 pre-processors on <strong>codepen.io</strong>. 
Aside from that you have to install a favorite CSS pre-processor on your web server.

This chapter was created to help you become familiar with SCSS. 
Other pre-processors share similar features, but the syntax may be different.

<h3>. Superset</h3>
Sassy CSS in any of its manifestations is a superset of the CSS language. 
This means, everything that works in CSS will still work in Sass or SCSS.

<h3>. Variables</h3>
<strong>Sass / SCSS</strong> allows you to work with variables. 
They are different from CSS variables that start with double dash <strong>— var-color</strong> you’ve probably seen before. 
Instead they start with a dollar sign <strong>$</strong>:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*HoXKaUhOiHATyDtR.png">
<strong>Figure 2 </strong>— Basic <strong>$variable</strong> definitions.

You can try to overwrite a variable name. 
If <strong>!default</strong> is appended to variable re-definition, and the variable already exists, it is not re-assigned again.

In other words, this means that the final value of variable <strong>$text</strong> from this example will still be <strong>“Piece of string.”</strong>

The second assignment <strong>“Another string.”</strong> is ignored, because default value already exists.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*ubRgqR8_LJehmvk6.png">
<strong>Figure 3 </strong>— Sass <strong>$variables</strong> can be assigned to any CSS property.
<h2>Nested Rules</h2>
With Standard CSS nested elements are accessed via space character:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*dbg3H6p0FiR7cCxS.png">
<strong>Figure 4 </strong>— Nesting with standard CSS.

The above code can be expressed with Sassy’s Nested Rules as follows:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*Xq0tx4mBudZnjfu6.png">
<strong>Figure 5 </strong>— Nested Rules.

As you can see this syntax appears cleaner and less repetitious.

This is in particular helpful for managing complex layouts. 
This way the align in which nested CSS properties are written in code closely matches the actual structure of the application layout.

Behind the veil the pre-processor still compiles this to the standard CSS <strong>(shown above)</strong> code so it can actually be rendered in the browser. 
We simply change the way CSS is written.
<h2>The &amp; character</h2>
Sassy CSS adds the <strong>&amp;</strong> (and) character directive.

Let’s take a look at how it works!

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*RL2U6BrJ3rxZas2y.png">
<strong>Figure 6 </strong>— On line 5 the <strong>&amp;</strong> character was used to specify <strong>&amp;:hover</strong> and converted to the name of the parent element <strong>a</strong> after compilation.

So what was the result of above SCSS code when it was converted to CSS?

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*Z1rWwX_BNlNgM8_1.png">
<strong>Figure 7 — </strong>The <strong>&amp;</strong> character is simply converted to the name of the parent element and becomes <strong>a:hover</strong> in this case.
<h2>Mixins</h2>
A mixin is defined by <strong>@mixin</strong> directive (or also known as <strong>mixin rule</strong>)

Let’s create our first <strong>@mixin</strong> that defines default Flex behavior:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*dUWqhQSs4OQGRebk.png">
<strong>Figure 8 — </strong>Now every time you apply <strong>.centered-elements</strong> class to an HTML element it will turn into Flexbox. 
One of the key benefits of mixins is that you can use them together with other CSS properties. 
Here I also added <strong>border:1px solid gray;</strong> to <strong>.centered-elements</strong> in addition to the mixin.

You can even pass arguments to a <strong>@mixin</strong> as if it were a function and then assign them to CSS properties. 
We’ll take a look at that in the next section.
<h2>Multiple Browsers Example</h2>
Some experimental features (such as <strong>-webkit-</strong>based) or Firefox (<strong>-moz-</strong>based) only work in browsers in which they appear.

Mixins are helpful in defining <strong>browser-agnostic</strong> CSS properties in <strong>one class</strong>.

For example if you need to rotate an element in Webkit-based browsers, as well as the other ones, you can create this mixin that takes <strong>$degree</strong> argument:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*OFTRSUBd9ZZEUPwR.png">
<strong>Figure 9 — </strong>Browser-agnostic <strong>@mixin</strong> for specifying angle of rotation.

Now all we have to do is <strong>@include</strong> this mixin in our CSS class definition:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*6AmamLDXPguN-Lz5.png">
<strong>Figure 10 — </strong>Rotate in compliance with all browsers.

<h3>. Arithmetic Operators</h3>
Similar to standard CSS syntax, you can <strong>add</strong>, <strong>subtract</strong>, <strong>multiply</strong> and <strong>divide</strong> values, without having to use the <strong>calc()</strong> function from the classic CSS syntax.

But there are a few non-obvious cases that might produce errors.

<h3>. Addition</h3>

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*F9pKsuRYlZJUd3EF.png">
<strong>Figure 11 </strong>— Adding values without using <strong>calc()</strong> function. 
Just make sure that both values are provided in a matching format.

<h3>. Subtraction</h3>
Subtraction operator — works in the same exact way as addition.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*rN2q5R0ajtg-2el9.png">
Subtracting different type of values.

<h3>. Multiplication</h3>
The star is used for multiplication. 
Just like with <strong>calc(a * b)</strong> in standard CSS.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*LZ0rHZYl8OIK5KNq.png">
<strong>Figure 12 </strong>— Multiplication and Division

<h3>. Division</h3>
Division is a bit tricky. 
Because in standard CSS the division symbol is reserved for using together with some other short-hand properties. 
For example, font: <strong>24/32px</strong> defines a font with size of <strong>25px</strong> and <strong>line-height</strong> of <strong>32px</strong>. 
But SCSS claims to be compatible with standard CSS.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*Uus378P7j2AKfvpV.png">
In standard CSS division symbol appears in short-hand font} property. 
But it isn’t used to actually divide values. 
So, how does Sass handle division?

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*_cp3akfnS0ZTF5Iz.png">
<strong>Figure 13 — </strong>If you want to divide two values, simply add parenthesis around the division operation. 
Otherwise, division will work only in combination with some of the other operators or functions.

<h3>. Remainder</h3>
The remainder calculates the remainder of the division operation. 
In this example, let’s see how it can be used to create a zebra stripe pattern for an arbitrary set of HTML elements.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*njwnokPtYOqZoNAH.png">
<figcaption>Creating Zebra stripes.</figcaption>

<strong>Figure 14 </strong>— Let’s start with creating a zebra mixin.

<strong>Note:</strong> the <strong>@for</strong> and <strong>@if</strong> rules are discussed in a following section.

This demo requires at least a few HTML elements:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*7DfNfW3F4yyx3h3g.png">
<strong>Figure 15</strong> — HTML source code for this mixin experiment.

And here is the browser outcome:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*AM3xQC9MlrfAGcRN.png">
<strong>Figure 16 </strong>— Zebra stripe generated by the zebra <strong>@mixin</strong>.

<h3>. Comparison Operators</h3><figure class="gb gc gd ge gf gg eb ec paragraph-image"><div><div><div><div><div>

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1818/0*_CgBIM_fwekEH-UY.png">
<strong>Figure 17 </strong>— Comparison Operators.

How can comparison operators be used in practice? We can try to write a <strong>@mixin</strong> that will choose padding sizing if its greater than margin:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*11l9I_XrUXx8OsVu.png">
<strong>Figure 18 </strong>— Comparison operators in action.

After compiling we will arrive at this CSS:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*5Ieylh3K9ZnIcor8.png">
<strong>Figure 19 </strong>— Result of the conditional spacing <strong>@mixin</strong>

<h3>. Logical Operators</h3><figure class="gb gc gd ge gf gg eb ec paragraph-image"><div><div><div><div><div>

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1452/1*1YDNrXNTHkcZSygXgOLO6Q.png">
<strong>Figure 20–</strong> Logical Operators.

<strong>Figure 21 </strong>— Using Sass Logical Operators, to create a button color class that changes its background color based on its width.

<h3>. Strings</h3>
In some cases it is possible to add strings to valid non-quoted CSS values, as long as the added string is trailing:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4816/1*deP56l0KWuIhJswWusvsqA.png">
<strong>Figure 22 </strong>— Combining regular CSS property values with Sass/SCSS strings.

The following example, on the other hand will produce compilation error:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*E7LPSngPS5Gmspzj.png">
<strong>Figure 23 </strong>— This example will not work.

You can add strings together without double quotes, as long as the string doesn’t contain spaces. 
For example, the following example will not compile:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*NRTFsd1HcArPN7LR.png">
<strong>Figure 24 </strong>— this example will not work, either. 
Solution?

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*YFlRzKDXg15iFYLe.png">
<strong>Figure 25 </strong>— Strings containing spaces must be wrapped in quotes.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*LyucE3fFY11WDCK3.png">
<strong>Figure 26</strong> — Adding multiple strings.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*vtWo_5qtCfsuJ7em.png">
<strong>Figure 27</strong> — Adding numbers and strings.

Note <code>content</code> property works only with pseudo selectors <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>. 
It is recommended to avoid using <code>content</code> property in your CSS definitions and instead always specify content between HTML tags. 
Here, it is explained only in context of working with strings in Sass/SCSS.

<h3>. Control-Flow Statements</h3>
SCSS has <strong>functions()</strong> and <strong>@directives</strong> (also known as rules). 
We’ve already created a type of a function when we looked at mixins you could pass arguments to.

A function usually has a parenthesis appended to the end of the function’s name. 
A directive / <strong>rule </strong>starts with an <strong>@</strong> character.

Just like in JavaScript or other languages SCSS lets you work with the standard set of control-flow statements.

<h3>. if()</h3>
<strong>if()</strong> is a function.

The usage is rather primitive. 
The statement will return one of the two specified values, based on a condition:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*iwJoQCtAhWbVXWb8.png">
<h3>. @if</h3>
<strong>@if</strong> is a directive used to branch out based on a condition.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4924/1*J5IiXKI_IxQ8xJK_MC8VGw.png">
This Sassy <strong>if-</strong>statement compiles to:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4924/1*69ggv_AT4CIQda-6hPoaRw.png">


<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*k0PSguxWAIisJrmn.png">
<strong>Figure 27 </strong>— Example of using a single <strong>if-</strong>statement and an <strong>if-</strong>else combo.

<h3>. Checking If Parent Exists</h3>
The AND symbol <strong>&amp;</strong> will select the parent element, if it exists. 
Or return <strong>null</strong> otherwise. 
Therefore, it can be used in combination with an <strong>@if</strong> directive.

In the following examples, let’s take a look at how we can create conditional CSS styles based on whether the parent element exists or not.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4924/1*A8S6n2zg7kcEIs4CZht2-A.png">
If parent doesn’t exist <strong>&amp;</strong> evaluates to <strong>null</strong> and an alternative style will be used.

<h3>. @for</h3>
The <strong>@for</strong> rule is used for repeating CSS definitions multiple times in a row.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4924/1*rCA7Gz6A6pjfcJBIcYDPuw.png">
<strong>Figure 28 </strong>— for-loop iterating over 5 items.

This loop will compile into the following CSS:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*6SmswKsOXrOQMSCg.png">
<strong>Figure 29 </strong>— Outcome of the for loop.

<h3>. @each</h3>
The <strong>@each</strong> rule can be used for iterating over a list of values.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4924/1*fZwbu7MdJNECOiFrF2d9OQ.png">
Iterating over a set of values.

This code will be compiled to the following CSS:

<strong>Figure 30 </strong>— Compiled animal icons.

<strong>@while</strong>

<strong>Figure 31 </strong>— While loop.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4924/1*rRVKKxe4d71pyavDyJaX3g.png">
<strong>Figure 32 </strong>— Listing of 5 HTML elements produced by while loop.
<h2>Sass Functions</h2>
Using Sass / SCSS you can define functions just like in any other language.

Let’s create a function <strong>three-hundred-px</strong> that returns value of <strong>300px</strong>.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4816/1*X018Rlf3cjgXukZ1nPcsIA.png">
<strong>Figure 33</strong> — Example of a function that returns a value.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*zQmdlEXFk8AiPWuW.png">
When the class <strong>.name</strong> is applied to an element a width of <strong>300px</strong> will be applied to it:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*zqZh71QbY6BH3SCN.png">
Of course Sass functions can return any valid CSS value and be assigned to any CSS property you can think of. 
They can even be calculated, based on a passed argument:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4816/1*6Z4Wuq2Avp5Ir7E-aRN56g.png">

<h2>Sass Trigonometry</h2>
Trigonometry functions <strong>sin</strong> and <strong>cos</strong> are often found as part of built-in classes in many languages, such as JavaScript, for example.

I think learning how they work is worth it, if you’re looking to reduce the time taken to design UI animations (Let’s say a spinning progress bar, for example.)

Here I will demonstrate a couple of examples that reduce code to a minimum for creating interesting animation effects using the <strong>sin()</strong> function. 
The same principles can be expanded upon to be used for creating interactive UI elements (movement around a circle, wavy designs, etc.)

Using trigonometry together with CSS is a great way to reduce bandwidth. 
Instead of using <strong>.gif</strong> animations (each might take an extra HTTP request to load since <strong>.gif</strong> animations cannot be placed into a single sprite-map image.)

You can write your own trigonometry functions in Sass.
<h2>Writing your own functions in Sass</h2>
This section was included to demonstrate how to write your own functions in Sass/SCSS.

In trigonometry many operations are based on these functions. 
They all build on top of each other. 
For example, the <strong>rad()</strong> function requires <strong>PI()</strong>. 
The <strong>cos()</strong> and <strong>sin()</strong> functions require <strong>rad()</strong> function.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*dJMz9a8qDN9RgTEJ.png">
Writing functions in <strong>Sass/SCSS</strong> feels a lot like writing them in JavaScript or similar programming languages.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*SB98IL7rV-by5lNZ.png">
<strong>Figure 34 — pow()</strong> function.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*bGu0zusIGirRh0jm.png">
<strong>Figure 35 — rad()</strong> function.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*gu7hCTAisGlCG7ev.png">
<strong>Figure 36 — sin()</strong> function.

Finally, to calculate <strong>tangent</strong> using the <strong>tan()</strong> function the functions <strong>sin()</strong> and <strong>cos()</strong> are required components.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*hn9KeZ8EoiEd4ATn.png">
If writing your own math and trigonometry functions isn’t exciting you can simply include compass library (see next example) and start using <strong>sin()</strong>, <strong>cos() </strong>and other trig functions out of the box.

<h3>. Oscillator Animation</h3>
Let’s take everything we learned from this chapter to put together a sinusoid oscillator animation.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*av9J98EXTlOSdVbF.png">
<strong>Figure 37 — </strong>Combining everything we know about Sassy CSS and CSS we arrive at this oscillating animation.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*azHuYKh7Y2aVNdCy.png">

<strong>Figure 38 — </strong>The HTML part. 
This is a shortened example. 
Make sure to have 15 actual HTML elements with <code>class = “atom”</code>

Finally, the result of this operation will produce the following animation:

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1368/0*w515H3pzxxgdTIvB.png">

<strong>Figure 39 — </strong>The result of previous code — an <strong>animated</strong> oscillating sin wave.

All of this has taken us roughly less than 24 lines of code!

<strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the Vue framework, you can render all 15 elements using this simple <strong>for-loop</strong> via the <strong>v-for</strong> directive — instead of typing out all 15 HTML elements by hand — further reducing the hassle.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4816/1*ubPjCypjy1fMEK59HNM9WQ.png">
<strong>Figure 40 </strong>— setup for listing 15 HTML elements with just few lines of code using the Vue framework.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*8erAYvQ-wtD0ySId.png">
<strong>Figure 40 </strong>— JavaScript Vue object that creates an Array object and fill it with 15 items containing value “0”.

I included it here just to show how combining multiple frameworks and libraries, your code becomes easier to write and maintain in the future.

Though, that is not to say you should use them in every single project. 
Sometimes it’s easier to write out the code in simple vanilla form.

Working professionally, though, chances are you will encounter a build using multiple libraries.

<script>
	var toc = $('#toc');
	$('h2, h3').each(function(i) {
		var topic = $(this), topicNumber = i + 1;
		toc.append('<a href="#topic-'+topicNumber+'" target="_self">'+topic.text()+'</a><br>');
		topic.attr('id', 'topic-' + topicNumber);
	});
