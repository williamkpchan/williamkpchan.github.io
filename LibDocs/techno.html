<h2>WHAT IS SLIME</h2>
Slime is made from a chemical reaction between a polymer (glue) and a slime activator (contains borate ions). 
The borate ions in the <a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/slime-activator-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slime activators</a> (sodium borate, borax powder, or boric acid) mix with the PVA (polyvinyl acetate) glue and forms this cool stretchy substance. 
This is called cross-linking!

The glue is a polymer, which means it is made up of long repeating, and identical strands or molecules. 
These molecules with flow past one another keeping the glue in a liquid state. 
Until&#8230;

You add the borate ions to the mixture,  and it then starts to connect these long strands together. 
They begin to tangle and mix until the substance is less like the liquid you started with and thicker and rubberier like slime! Slime is a polymer.

Picture the difference between wet spaghetti and leftover spaghetti the next day. 
As the slime forms, the tangled molecule strands are much like the clump of spaghetti!

<h2>BEST SLIME INGREDIENTS</h2>
There are 3 main ingredients for classic homemade slime that I will talk about below. 
Water is an essential ingredient as well! Baking soda is an important addition to <a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/make-homemade-slime-saline-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saline solution slime</a> and <a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/how-to-make-slime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fluffy slime</a>. 
It is necessary for the activator to fully work.

<strong>RECOMMENDED SLIME SUPPLIES</strong>
You will also find our favorite storage options.

<h2>

<strong>1. 
GLUE</strong></h2>
From what you read above, 
<strong>the right type of glue is very important and is the foundation for a good homemade slime</strong>. 
You want to look for a washable PVA based glue which is usually also listed as school glue.

Our choices usually include Elmer&#8217;s brand of washable school glues {
<a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/recommended-supplies-for-making-slime/">see recommended supply list here</a>
}. 
Clear, white, and glitter are all good choices. 
Now many of you might not have access to Elmer&#8217;s Glue so I would make sure you are finding a PVA based glue {polyvinyl-acetate}.

<h2>
2. 
SLIME ACTIVATOR</h2>
Each of our
<strong> basic slime recipes uses a different slime activator</strong>. 
The slime activator is the key ingredient for slime. 
When mixed with the PVA glue, the activator causes the specific chemical reaction that produces your slimy texture. 
If you don&#8217;t have the right slime activator, you don&#8217;t have slime.

Let&#8217;s talk a minute about slime activators, none of them are borax free. 
That&#8217;s right! Slime recipes are NOT completely borax free. 
Each of the popular slime activators that you see in all of those recipes will have at least one ingredient from the boron family.


<strong>Slime Activators are:</strong>

<ul><li>Liquid Starch</li>
<li>Saline Solution</li>
<li>Borax Powder</li>
</ul>

It&#8217;s up to you to decide what you want to use, but I have seen a lot of sites claim that recipes using saline solution and liquid starch are borax free. 
This is NOT true 99% of the time.

There are tons of ways to make <a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/alternative-slime-recipes-no-starch-borax-detergent-fiber-slimes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">borax free homemade slime</a> that include borax substitutes such as fiber, cornstarch, marshmallows but these WON&#8221;T give you the unique texture and stretch that you get with our <a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/make-basic-slime-recipes-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic slime recipes.</a>

<h3><a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/liquid-starch-slime-easy-sensory-play-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<strong>LIQUID STARCH SLIME</strong></a>
</h3>
To make our <a href="https://littlebinsforlittlehands.com/liquid-starch-slime-easy-sensory-play-recipe/">liquid starch slime recipe</a>
{which is super easy to make}, you need a bottle of liquid starch. 
This can be purchased in the laundry detergent aisle of your grocery store, big box store, and even online if necessary.

saline solutions 
This slime is the new popular slime in our recipe collection. 
It&#8217;s a good slime for UK slime recipes as well as Canadian slime recipes.

When you are looking for your saline solution, make sure the ingredients include sodium borate and boric acid. 
I can&#8217;t write it enough! You need these slime ingredients for making homemade slime. 
My favorite brand of saline solution is actually Target Brand!

<h3><strong>BORAX SLIME</strong></h3>
This is your most classic and most controversial slime recipe, and it requires a box of borax powder. 

This slime ingredient can easily be found in the laundry detergent aisle as well.
