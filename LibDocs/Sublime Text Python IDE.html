<center><h4>Sublime Text Python IDE</h4>
<div id="toc"></div></center>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic Settings</h2>
<p>All configuration in Sublime Text is done via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>. It's simple to learn. go
and read that link then return here.</p>
<p>There are a number of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/settings.html">different levels of configuration</a> in Sublime Text. You
will most often work on settings at the user level.</p>
<p>Open <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Preferences</span></tt> -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Settings</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">Default</span></tt> to see all the default settings
and choose which to override.</p>
<p>Create your own set of preferences by opening <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Preferences</span></tt> -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Settings</span> <span class="pre">-</span>
<span class="pre">User</span></tt>. This will create an empty file, you can then copy the settings you want
to override from the default set into your personal settings.</p>
<p>Here's a reasonable set of preliminary settings (theme, color scheme and font
are quite personal, find ones that suit you.):</p>
<div class="highlight-json"><div class="highlight"><pre>source

{
    &quot;color_scheme&quot;: &quot;Packages/User/Cobalt (SL).tmTheme&quot;,
    &quot;theme&quot;: &quot;Soda Light 3.sublime-theme&quot;,
    // A font face that helps distinguish between 0 (the number) and &#39;O&#39; (the letter)
    // among other problem characters.
    &quot;font_face&quot;: &quot;DroidSansMonoSlashed&quot;,
    // getting older. I wonder if comfy font size increases as a linear
    //  function of age?
    &quot;font_size&quot;: 15,
    &quot;ignored_packages&quot;:
    [
        // I&#39;m not a vi user, so this is of no use to me.
        &quot;Vintage&quot;
    ],
    &quot;rulers&quot;:
    [
        // set text rulers so I can judge line length for pep8
        72, // docstrings
        79, // optimum code line length
        100  // maximum allowable length
    ],
    &quot;word_wrap&quot;: false, // I hate auto-wrapped text.
    &quot;wrap_width&quot;: 79 // This is used by a plugin elsewhere
    &quot;tab_size&quot;: 4,
    &quot;translate_tabs_to_spaces&quot;: true,
    &quot;use_tab_stops&quot;: true,
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Especially important is the setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">translate_tabs_to_spaces</span></tt>, which ensures
that any time you hit a tab key, the single <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\t</span></tt> character is replaced by four
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\s</span></tt> characters.  In Python this is <strong>vital</strong>!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extending-the-editor">
<h2>Extending the Editor</h2>
<p>Most of the requirements above go beyond basic editor function. Use Plugins.</p>
<p>Sublime Text comes with a great system for <a class="reference external" href="https://sublime.wbond.net">Package Control</a>. It handles
installing and uninstalling plugins, and even updates installed plugins for
you. You can also manually install plugins that haven't made it to the big-time
yet, including <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/plugins.html">ones you write yourself</a>. Happily, the plugin system is
Python!</p>
<p>To install a plugin using Package Control, open the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">command</span> <span class="pre">palette</span></tt> with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shift-super-P</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctrl-shift-P</span></tt> on Windows/Linux). The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt> key is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">command</span></tt>
or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">âŒ˜</span></tt> on OS X. When the palette opens, typing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">install</span></tt> will bring up the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Package</span> <span class="pre">Control:</span> <span class="pre">Install</span> <span class="pre">Package</span></tt> command. Hit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enter</span></tt> to select it.</p>


<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/pc_menu.png"><img alt="The package control command in the command palette." class="align-center" src="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/pc_menu.png"></a>
<p>After you select the command, Sublime Text fetches an updated list of packages
from the network. It might take a second or two for the list to appear. When it
does, start to type the name of the package you want. Sublime Text filters the
list and shows you what you want to see. To install a plugin, select it with
the mouse, or use arrow keys to navigate the list and hit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enter</span></tt> when your
plugin is highlighted.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/plugin_list.png"><img alt="../../_images/plugin_list.png" class="align-center" src="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/plugin_list.png"></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="useful-plugins">
<h2>Useful Plugins</h2>
<p>Here are the plugins I've installed to achieve the requirements above.</p>
<div class="section" id="autocompletion">
<h3>Autocompletion</h3>
<p>By default, Sublime Text will index symbols in open files and projects, but
that doesn't cover installed python packages that may be part of a non-standard
run environment.</p>
<p>There are two to choose from:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeCodeIntel">SublimeCodeIntel</a> offers strong support for multiple languages through
it's own plugin system.  It is a bit heavy and requires building an index.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Jedi%20-%20Python%20autocompletion">SublimeJedi</a> only supports Python, but is faster and keeps an index on its
own.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've installed <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SublimeJedi</span></tt>, and used the following settings <em>per project</em> to
ensure that all relevant code is found:</p>
<div class="highlight-json"><div class="highlight"><pre>{
    &quot;folders&quot;:
    [
        // ...
    ],

    &quot;settings&quot;: {
        // ...
        &quot;python_interpreter_path&quot;: &quot;/Users/cewing/pythons/python-2.7/bin/python&quot;,

        &quot;python_package_paths&quot;: [
            &quot;/path/to/project/buildout/parts/omelette&quot;
        ]
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python_interpreter_path</span></tt> allows me to indicate which Python executable
should be introspected for symbol definitions.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python_package_paths</span></tt> setting allows designating additional paths that
will be searched for Python packages containing symbols.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/tab_completion.png"><img alt="Tab completion provided by SublimeJedi" class="align-center" src="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/tab_completion.png"></a>
<p>Once configured, you should be able to use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctrl-shift-G</span></tt> keyboard
shortcut to jump directly to the definition of a symbol. You can also use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alt-shift-F</span></tt> to find other usages of the same symbol elsewhere in your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-linting">
<h3>Code Linting</h3>
<p>Code linting shows you mistakes you've made in your source <em>before</em> you attempt
to run the code. This saves time. Sublime Text has an available plugin for code
linters called <a class="reference external" href="http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">SublimeLinter</a>.</p>
<p>Python has a couple of great tools available for linting, the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8">pep8</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes">pyflakes</a> packages. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Pep8</span></tt> checks for style violations, lines too long,
extra spaces and so on. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Pyflakes</span></tt> checks for syntactic violations, like
using a symbol that isn't defined or importing a symbol you don't use.</p>
<p>Another Python linting package, <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8">flake8</a> combines these two, and adds in
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mccabe">mccabe</a>, a tool to check the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> of code you write. This
can be of great help in discovering methods and functions that could be
simplified and thus made easier to understand and more testable.</p>
<p>There is a nice plugin for the SublimeLinter that <a class="reference external" href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter-flake8">utilizes flake8</a>. For it to
work, the plugin will need to have a Python executable that has the Python
tools it needs installed.</p>
<p>Use <a class="reference external" href="http://virtualenv.org">virtualenv</a> to accomplish this. First, create a virtualenv and activate
it:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd /Users/cewing/virtualenvs
$ virtualenv sublenv
New python executable in sublenv/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip...done.
$ source sublenv/bin/activate
(sublenv)$
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then use Python packaging tools to install the required packages:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>(sublenv)$ pip install flake8
Downloading/unpacking flake8
[...]
Downloading/unpacking pyflakes&gt;=0.7.3 (from flake8)
[...]
Downloading/unpacking pep8&gt;=1.4.6 (from flake8)
[...]
Downloading/unpacking mccabe&gt;=0.2.1 (from flake8)
[...]
Installing collected packages: flake8, pyflakes, pep8, mccabe
[...]
Successfully installed flake8 pyflakes pep8 mccabe
Cleaning up...
(sublenv)$
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The Python executable for this <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></tt> now has the required packages
installed. You can look in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/path/to/sublenv/bin</span></tt> to see the executable
commands for each:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(sublenv)$ ls sublenv/bin
activate            easy_install-2.7    pip2.7
activate.csh        flake8              pyflakes
activate.fish       pep8                python
activate_this.py    pip                 python2
easy_install        pip2                python2.7</div></blockquote>
<p>Now install SublimeLinter and then SublimeLinter-flake8 using Package Control.</p>
<p>Here are the settings you can add to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Preferences</span></tt> -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Package</span> <span class="pre">Settings</span></tt> -&gt;
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SublimeLinter</span></tt> -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Settings</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">User</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-json"><div class="highlight"><pre>{
    //...
    &quot;linters&quot;: {
        &quot;flake8&quot;: {
            &quot;@disable&quot;: false,
            &quot;args&quot;: [],
            &quot;builtins&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
            &quot;excludes&quot;: [],
            &quot;ignore&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
            &quot;max-complexity&quot;: 10,
            &quot;max-line-length&quot;: null,
            &quot;select&quot;: &quot;&quot;
        }
    },
    //...
    &quot;paths&quot;: {
        &quot;linux&quot;: [],
        &quot;osx&quot;: [
            &quot;/Users/cewing/virtualenvs/sublenv/bin&quot;
        ],

        ],
        &quot;windows&quot;: []
    },
    //...
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paths</span></tt> key points to the path that contains the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flake8</span></tt> executable
command.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python_paths</span></tt> key points to the location of the python executable to be
used.</p>
<p>The settings inside the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flake8</span></tt> object control the performance of the
linter. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-flake8#settings">Read more about them here</a>.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/flake8_output.png"><img alt="Flake8 shows unused import and trailing whitespace issues." class="align-center" src="https://cewing.github.io/training.codefellows/_images/flake8_output.png"></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="white-space-management">
<h3>White Space Management</h3>
<p>One of the issues highlighted by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flake8</span></tt> is trailing spaces.  Sublime text
provides a setting that allows you to remove them every time you save a file:</p>
<div class="highlight-json"><div class="highlight"><pre>source

{
    &quot;trim_trailing_whitespace_on_save&quot;: true
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Do not use this setting</strong></p>
<p>Removing trailing whitespace by default causes a <em>ton</em> of noise in commits.</p>
<p>Keep commits for stylistic cleanup separate from those that make important
changes to code.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces">TrailingSpaces</a> SublimeText plugin can help with this.</p>
<p>Here are the settings you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight-json"><div class="highlight"><pre>{
    //...
    &quot;trailing_spaces_modified_lines_only&quot;: true,
    &quot;trailing_spaces_trim_on_save&quot;: true,
    // ...
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This allows trimming whitespace on save, but <em>only on lines you have directly
modified</em>. You can still trim <em>all</em> whitespace manually and keep changesets
free of noise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-along">
<h3>Follow-Along</h3>
<p>The final requirement for a reasonable IDE experience is to be able to follow a
debugging session in the file where the code exists.</p>
<p>There is no plugin for SublimeText that supports this. But there is a Python
package you can install into the virtualenv for each of your projects that does
it.</p>
<p>The package is called <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PdbSublimeTextSupport">PDBSublimeTextSupport</a> and its simple to install with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">(</span>projectenv<span class="o">)</span><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install PDBSublimeTextSupport
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With that package installed in the Python that is used for your project, any
breakpoint you set will automatically pop to the surface in SublimeText.  And
as you step through the code, you will see the current line in your Sublime
Text file move along with you.</p>

<h2></h2>

<h1>Sublime Text - Creating First Document</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn step by step how to create a file in Sublime Text.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Use the option <b>New File</b> to create a file in Sublime Text editor.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Once the new file is available, you can insert the code, similar to any other text editor, and save the file in your working repository.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Once you save the associated file, Sublime Text editor provides a variety of options based on the type of file, for example <b>.php</b> for PHP scripts, <b>.py</b> for Python scripts and <b>.java</b> for Java code base.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; As our code repository is on Python project, we will save the file as <b>demo1.py</b>, as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/creating_file_step4.jpg" alt="Creating File Step-4" />
<h1>Sublime Text - Editing First Text Document</h1>
<p>Code editors allow the users to edit the code scripts and text documents with various shortcut keys. In this chapter, let us understand through various examples about editing options of first text document in Sublime Text.</p>
<h2>Simultaneous Write-Up</h2>
<p>In this example, you will see how to add print statements at two locations.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Consider the first script of Python with the following code in it &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/editing_first_document_step1.jpg" alt="Editing First Document step-1" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Let us suppose that, in the given script you want to mention the starting and ending points of the loop, using simple statements. You can write the print statement wherever required, however, in Sublime Text editor you can simultaneously add comments and statements in two places with a shortcut of <b>Ctrl+cursor</b> point for Windows or Linux, and <b>Cmd+cursor</b> point for Mac. Then, you can see the cursor points as mentioned below &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/editing_first_document_step2.jpg" alt="Editing First Document step-2" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Now, you can insert the print statements at both the locations of the mentioned cursor points, as shown in the image below.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/editing_first_document_step3.jpg" alt="Editing First Document step-3" />
<h2>Finding Occurrences</h2>
<p>Sublime Text editor includes a feature to find the occurrences of the keywords included in the scripts. The shortcut key for finding occurrences of the keyword is <b>Ctrl+D</b> after highlighting the associated keyword.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/finding_occurrences.jpg" alt="Finding Occurrences" />
<p>If you want to search for a keyword, say <b>print</b> from the given code, you can use <b>Ctrl+D</b> or <b>Cmd+D</b> to get the count of occurrences of the associated keyword.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/counting_occurrences.jpg" alt="Counting Occurrences" />
<h2>Appending Comments in Line</h2>
<p>We can append comments at the end of line using the shortcut key <b>Ctrl+Shift+L</b> for Windows and <b>Cmd+Shift+L</b> for Mac operating system after selecting the code section where you actually need the comment.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/appending_comments_in_line.jpg" alt="Appending Comments in Line" />
<h1>Sublime Text - Patterns of Code Editing</h1>
<p>There are various types of code editing and shortcut keys used in Sublime Text editor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Splitting the selection into lines</li>
<li>Wrapping the complete paragraph in HTML file</li>
<li>Finding all occurrences</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter discusses each of them in detail.</p>
<h2>Splitting the Selection into Lines</h2>
<p>The key combination <b>Ctrl+Shift+L</b> allows you to select the blocks of lines and split them, on Windows. The screenshot given below explains this &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/splitting_selection_into_lines.jpg" alt="Splitting the Selection into Lines" />
<h2>Wrapping Complete Paragraph in HTML File</h2>
<p>The key combination <b>Alt+Shift+w</b> for Windows and Cmd+Shift+w for Mac, allows the user to split the sections of code and create various paragraphs. It is referred as a <b>wrap selection with html tag</b>. This also allows you to include HTML tags using Sublime editor.</p>
<p>The screenshot given below explains wrapping text with a HTML tag &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/wrapping_complete_paragraph_in_html_file.jpg" alt="Wrapping Complete Paragraph in HTML File" />
<p>After wrapping the text, the text wrapped with a HTML tag will be seen as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/after_wrapping_text.jpg" alt="After Wrapping the Text" />
<h2>Finding all Occurrences</h2>
<p>The key pattern <b>Ctrl+Shift+f</b> allows you to find a keyword in a given project. The screenshot given below explains this &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/finding_all_occurrences.jpg" alt="Finding all Occurrences" /> 
<p>The shortcut key opens a window with three options included in it, namely <b>find, where</b> and <b>replace</b>,</p>
<p>where,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>find</b> refers to the search of the particular keyword,</p></li>
<li><p><b>where</b> mentions the section as to which repository is searched, and</p></li>
<li><p><b>replace</b> mentions the keyword which is replaced instead of find keyword.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Sublime Text - Sublime Linter</h1>
<p>Linting is the process of flagging suspicious constructs and likely to be bugs in any programming language.</p>
<p>Sublime Linter is the package of Sublime Text that helps you to perform linting in Sublime. It helps in creating files in different modes for the manipulation of code base. It is not an in built package and you need to install it manually.</p>
<p>You can install any package control in Sublime Text editor using the shortcut key combination <b>Ctrl+Shift+P</b>, and selecting the <b>Package Control: Install Package</b> option.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/install_linter_package.jpg" alt="Install Linter Package" />
<p>Select the associated package to install in Sublime Text editor. To install Sublime Linter, you need to select the option of <b>SublimeLinter</b> plugin.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/select_associated_package_to_install.jpg" alt="Select the Associated Package to Install" />
<p>On successful installation, your screen will look as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/sublime_linter_successful_installation.jpg" alt="Sublime Linter Successful Installation" />
<h2>Modes of Sublime Linter</h2>
<p>Sublime Linter runs in four different modes as mentioned below &minus;</p>
<h3>Background Mode</h3>
<p>When the Sublime Linter key is set to <b>true</b>, linting is performed in the background constantly each time the file is modified.</p>
<h3>Load-Save Mode</h3>
<p>When the Sublime Linter key is set to , linting <b>load save</b>will be performed when a file is loaded from the repository.</p>
<h3>Save-Only Mode</h3>
<p>When the Sublime Linter key is set to <b>save only</b> mode, linting is performed while saving the particular file in working repository.</p>
<h3>On Demand Mode</h3>
<p>In the on-demand mode, the Sublime Linter will be set to <b>true</b>, using the shortcut <b>Ctrl+Alt+L</b>, which sets up the linter to detect bugs, if any present in the code.</p>
<h1>Sublime Text - Shortcuts</h1>
<p>Sublime Text editor includes shortcuts and methods for manipulating the output. This chapter discusses in detail about these shortcuts with the help of suitable illustrations.</p>
<h2>Opening the Command Palette</h2>
<p>Command palette in Sublime Text editor includes options for installing packages and console. The shortcut key for this purpose is <b>Ctrl+Shift+P</b> for Windows and <b>Cmd+Shift+P</b> for Mac. The screenshot given below shows opening the command palette using this shortcut.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/opening_command_palette.jpg" alt="Opening the Command Palette" />
<h2>Toggle Side Bar</h2>
<p>Sublime text editor includes a side bar which displays the scripts or the file names. You can use the shortcut key <b>Ctrl+KB</b> on Windows and <b>Cmd+KB</b> for Mac for this purpose.</p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/toggle_side_bar1.jpg" alt="Toggle Side Bar 1" />
<p></p>
<img src ="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/images/toggle_side_bar2.jpg" alt="Toggle Side Bar2" />
