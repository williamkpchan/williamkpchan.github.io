<h3>123D Design</h3>

<img src="https://all3dp.com/app/uploads/2015/03/123d-design-anatomy-of-lightsabre-tony-mullen-e1477573532667-1024x575.jpg">
<div class="rich-text">
<p>Autodesk 123D Design is a hobbyist 3D CAD and 3D modeling software created by Autodesk. It is similar in scope to SketchUp and based on Autodesk's Inventor.</p>
<p>Being part of its free of Autodesk's charge 123D Apps collection, it is a powerful yet relatively simple to use 3D creation and editing tool that can work seamlessly with most 3D printer models in the market.</p>
<p>123D Design uses a simple and intuitive graphical user interface that places your toolbox on the top and the view tools right beneath it, with the design area taking the rest of the space. Meshes are designed by placing primitive shapes in the design area. These shape's properties can be refined with an array of tools, including more advanced techniques like sweep and loft. As well as the more basic drawing and modeling capabilities, it also has assembly and constraint support and STL export. There is also a library of premade blocks and objects, which can be valuable timesavers.</p>
<p>123D Design can be used like a 3D CAD software, in case you prefer a technical 3D design approach. In addition, the capability of importing SVG files makes 123D Design a handy 3D modeling software tool to create mechanical parts from drawings stored in that format.</p>
<p>Relevant to 3D printing are the grid presets for the table size of your 3D printer which will give you an impression of the dimensions of your 3D design.</p>
<p>A powerful, yet relatively simple to use tool. Beyond any doubt, one of the best 3D modeling software for beginners who want to get a solid foundation in the art.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">UPDATE:</span> As of spring 2017, Autodesk has discontinued its popular 123D software line of free 3D modeling and scanning tools. However, the programs are still running on many computers worldwide. For this reason, All3DP will keep its tutorials and reviews accessible for as long as these programs can be run.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.3dslash.net/index.php" target="_blank">3D Slash</a> </h3>
<img src="https://all3dp.com/app/uploads/2015/07/3D-Slash-Lightsaber-768x437.png">
<div class="rich-text">
<p>3D Slash is a free and easy to use 3D modeling software that lets you create models using a simple building-block concept similar to Minecraft.</p>
<p>Working with 3D Slash will be a bit of a shock for modeling veterans since conventional features like extrusion, revolution or sweeps are not part of the program. Instead, modeling is centered around the cuboid, a solid block that can be subdivided into smaller blocks of identical size. Users create their 3D designs by working the cuboid with an array of tools that will not be familiar from most other 3D modeling software: hammer, trowel, chisel, pulpwood, and drill. Thus, you use the hammer tool to remove individual cubes, while the trowel adds cubes. And so forth.</p>
<p>3D designing with these tools is easy, even for beginners. With only a little training you can achieve impressive results, like a light saber (see our <a href="https://all3dp.com/3d-slash-tutorial/">tutorial</a>). It is also noteworthy that you can import and modify existing 3D designs. By default, the tools will result in pixelated prints – if you prefer crisp edges and smooth surfaces, simply choose tool sizes below the resolution of your printer.</p>
<p>For your convenience, this 3D modeling software ties in with a range of online printing services and model repositories. Or you can simply export your 3D design to STL and print it on your 3D desktop printer.</p>
<p>The playful, hands-on approach will be especially gratifying for hobbyists who occasionally want to create their 3D designs without having to master the mysterious lore of conventional 3D modeling software. We also recommend it to seasoned 3D modelers who want to explore a different take on their craft. If you are a beginner with aspirations of going pro one day, you will be better off with a tool that will introduce you to the fundamentals of conventional modeling like TinkerCAD or 123D Design.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop CC</a> </h3>
<img src="https://all3dp.com/app/uploads/2016/10/photoshop-768x323.jpg">
<div class="rich-text">
<p>Though not a known as 3D modeling software, the famous graphics editor has included limited functionality for some time. 3D printing, however, is only supported since version 14.1.</p>
<p>The Adobe developers are aware that they cannot beat industry leaders like Autodesk at their game. So, it does not come as a surprise that Photoshop only half-heartedly ventures into three-dimensional space. For instance, it does not include any real modeling capabilities. Instead, it requires the user to import external files that you can adapt for rendering images or 3D printing. The only modest ways of modeling in Photoshop are the extrusion and repoussé options.</p>
<p>However, it does provide some help for 3D printing. It can generate support structures and scale the mesh to fit the selected printer. Also of value are the mesh repair tools that will help generate a watertight STL file.</p>
<p>Like its competitors in the 3D modeling software sphere, Photoshop is connected to various online marketplaces and printing services. This allows you to prepare your meshes from the toolbar to the requirements of your printing service.<br>
Photoshop and 3D printing may not be love at first sight. But if you are curious about 3D printing and have Photoshop installed already, you're good to go.</p>
<p>Targeting: Anyone who has Photoshop installed anyway and needs a 3D print</p>

<div class="rich-text">
<p>An alternative approach to traditional 3D modeling is the concept of sculpting within a 3D modeling software. There are some commercial options on the market, most of which have pretty steep learning curves. These will be introduced below among the intermediate and professional tools. SculptGL, on the other hand, includes only the basic tools necessary and allows you to give you a sense of the sculpting workflow – All in the comfort of your web browser.</p>
<p>As in more advanced sculpting tools, you don't try to create a high-resolution mesh right from the start, but build up levels of detail step by step. In practice, you will either start out with a primitive that you mold into your 3D design from scratch or load a template (a generic human body, etc.) from 3D modeling software as a basis. The groundwork is always to define the silhouette (arms, heads, limbs) in very broad brushes. From there you can switch to smaller brushes and sculpt large details, pronounced muscles, fingers and the like. Only then you can add intricate details like wrinkles or scars using finer brushes.</p>
<p>This being a free 3D modeling software, the number and complexity of objects are limited to the minimum. For anyone just curious about 3D sculpting, this is the best 3D modeling software, to begin with. If you want to level up, you should give Sculptris a try – if you want to go pro, try <a href="#ZBrush">ZBrush</a> or <a href="#Mudbox">Mudbox</a>.</p>

<h3>SelfCAD </h3>
<img src="https://all3dp.com/app/uploads/2017/06/selfCAD-1024x489.jpg">
<div class="rich-text">
<p>The self-proclaimed “leader in online 3D modeling and slicing software”, SelfCAD packages the complete design-to-print workflow in one neatly presented bundle. At its core SelfCAD features a robust 3D modeling application that allows for the design of complex and 3D printable objects.</p>
<p>An intuitive GUI and TinkerCAD-level of simplicity in the way tools work and manipulate your designs mean that virtually anyone can dive in and start creating. And you can also load in a flat image to serve as a template to your workings, so a reference is always at hand.</p>
<p>But perhaps the defining proficiency of SelfCAD as 3D modeling software is its ability to prepare models for 3D printing, even taking the job as far as slicing and piping the g-code directly to your computer. A host of predefined RepRap 3D printers are available from a drop down, but you can enter the specifications for any not included.</p>
<p>All this from any web-browser you point at the SelfCAD website. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>Targeting: 3D printing makers looking to get up to speed with 3D design quickly</p>

<div class="rich-text">
<p>Don't be fooled, TinkerCAD is not some 3D modeling kindergarten. It is true, TinkerCAD allows you to combine primitive shapes like toddlers do. Using basic modeling operations, TinkerCAD allows you to join these primitives complex objects. But there is more to TinkerCAD, the functionality extends to joining and subtracting shapes. After mastering these basic techniques, even newbies to 3D modeling software can produce impressive results like Raspberry Pi cases in no time.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a tool to get your feet wet, you will love TinkerCAD's intuitive approach to common concepts and tools in 3D modeling software.</p>

<h3><a href="https://clara.io/" target="_self">Clara.io</a> </h3>
<img src="https://all3dp.com/app/uploads/2017/06/Claraio-1024x627.png">
<div class="rich-text">
<p>Clara.io is an impressive browser-based 3D modeling software. It includes all the common modeling tools for polygon modeling, like extrusion, beveling, slicing, cutting, and looping. In terms of texture maps, you get UV mapping. Pretty much everything you need for basic 3D modeling purposes.</p>
<p>But Clara.io goes beyond the functionality you would expect from a browser 3D modeling software. For instance, the rendering does not need to shy away from many desktop programs. It includes V-Ray, that allows you to light your meshes using an HDR image and many other nifty tricks. In case you want to create computer animated movies, Clara.io is even the right tool for that. As it supports basic keyframe animation.</p>
<p>One of the many useful features of this 3D modeling software is collaboratively working on projects. Similarly to Google Docs, you can add other Clara.io users to the scene that can then modify the file. Every change made is automatically synched between the accounts, this means other users get to see the scene transforming before their eyes instantaniously. This allows for a truly collaborative experience.</p>

<p>Though not a classic 3D modeling software, like Poser it is a character creation tool. MakeHuman is the only free character creation tool that we know of. It started out as a plugin for Blender and has since become an independent application.</p>
<p>With MakeHuman it really is child's play to generate 3D files of humans. As this 3D modeling software allows you to manipulate what is called a “base mesh” – an ageless, genderless humanoid 3D file. You rapidly flesh out a distinctive and convincing character by sliding thoughtfully organized bars (gender, face, torso, arms, and legs). The customizations are truly comprehensive, you can literally manipulate your character down to the tips of the hair.</p>
<p>Luckily, your creations don't have to stay nude. There are many different options of clothing available, from casual to chic. But we are only scratching at the surface. As this 3D modeling software includes extensive rigging options for game development and computer animation alike. Even the face is set up with enough controls to achieve decent facial expressions. This wealth of features enables you to generate convincing 3D models in a breeze.</p>
<p>MakeHuman is also a great tool to create a mesh that you then refine in 3D sculpting tools like ZBrush. For Blender users, MakeHuman offers a dedicated tool that facilitates the exchange between the two. It should be apparent, that this is one of the best 3D modeling software of its kind.</p>

<p>MoI (short for “Moment of Inspiration”) is a 3D modeling software that has been specifically developed for artists and designers. The explicit goal of the developer was to create a program that has the full functionality of a 3D CAD software, such as NURBS surfaces or filleting, but without the technical complexities that go along with that. Instead, the mathematical aspects are processed under the hood, leaving users the freedom to focus on their 3D designs.</p>
<p>Whereas conventional 3D CAD software tend to be quite right-click heavy, MoI sports a simple user interface. One of the distinctive features of MoI is the user interface that is completely compatible with pen tablets – in fact, this 3D modeling software can be operated without typing the keyboard at all.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side, you can choose between drawing lines or solids. The 3D designs can be worked with essential tools that are focused on the essentials like extrusion, fillet, offset loft and a handful others. Transformations: rotate, scale, array, align, deform and a few others. For precise work, there are windows to enter exact measurements. For additional tools, you can take a look at the scripts developed by the MoI community.</p>
<p>The developers pride themselves on the low learning curve of their product. This allows artists without any background in 3D modeling or CAD to quickly create mechanical or organic meshes ready for 3D printing.</p>
<p>If you need a tool that MoI emphasizes the creative process over technical gimmicks, MoI is the best 3D modeling software for you. For a more technical NURBS tool, we suggest <a href="#Rhino3D">Rhino3D</a>.</p>

<p>As in more advanced sculpting tools, the main concept is that you don't try to create a high-resolution mesh right from the start. But build up levels of detail step by step. In practice, you will either start out with a primitive that you mold into your 3D design from scratch or load template (a generic human body etc.) as a basis. The groundwork is always to define the silhouette (arms, heads, limbs) in very broad brushes. From there you can switch to smaller brushes and sculpt large details, pronounced muscles, fingers and the like. Only then you can add intricate details like wrinkles or scars using finer brushes.</p>

<p>SketchUp is mostly known for being the tool architectural landmarks are modeled with Google Earth's and not 3D printing. And although its present owner specializes in geoinformation SketchUp is used for visualization and planning in a variety of industries spanning architecture, interior design, urban planning, engineering, and construction.</p>
<p>What strikes the first time user of SketchUp at once is the neat and tidy interface. There are not many buttons that can boggle beginners trying to understand the 3D modeling software. It is easy to grasp the basic principles behind SketchUp, making it possible to create simple 3D printable models from scratch within the first few hours of learning. This is thanks to some intuitive tools that allow navigating and sculpting accurately in 3D view.</p>
<p>Which is not say that SketchUp is only capable of simple 3D modeling. Since SketchUp encourages users and third party companies to contribute <a href="http://extensions.sketchup.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">extensions</a> – many of them free of charge – there is virtually no limit to its potential capabilities. One case in point is Curviloft, bringing to SketchUp a set of tools that allow modeling complex organic structures. The 3D modeling software also includes drawing layout functionality and allows surface rendering in a variety of “styles”.</p>
<p>SketchUp comes with its own exchange repository integrated into the program itself: 3D Warehouse – a library where approximately 2.2 million SketchUp models can be downloaded directly into the program. Files are limited to a size of 50 MB. 3D Warehouse is connected to the online printing service Materialise.Cloud. By the push of one button Materialise. Cloud claims to automatically repair any glitches the model might have and produce a watertight STL file, that can be downloaded from 3D Warehouse.</p>
<p>This 3D modeling software does not support STL files out of the box. Instead, importing and exporting STL files are enabled by the extension “SketchUp STL” that can be downloaded and installed from within the program.</p>
<p>In addition, this 3D modeling software supports a handful of handy free extensions to prepare your SketchUp files for 3D printing:</p>

</ul><p>We also want to point out several extensions that connect SketchUp to external services. These provide important functionality such as cleaning up meshes, getting an estimate for the cost of printing and ordering a print (i.materialise, Makeprintable) – be aware that these services may require you to subscribe in order to work.</p>

<p>The first professional sculpting tool in our list, is the direct competitor to <a href="#ZBrush">ZBrush</a>, Autodesk's Mudbox. Like ZBrush, it incorporated concepts known from clay sculpting into the realm of 3D modeling software.</p>
<p>The main concept to grasp is often called »progressive detailing«. That means you don't try to create a high-resolution mesh right from the start. But build up levels of detail step by step. In practice, you will load a template (a generic human body etc.) as a basis. The groundwork is always to define the silhouette (arms, heads, limbs) in very broad brushes.

<p>Though both <a href="#ZBrush">ZBrush</a> and Mudbox draw on the same concept, they implement it slightly differently. With many critics calling Mudbox somewhat friendlier for beginners in 3D sculpting, since it builds on the user experience of the other Autodesk products. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that ZBrush beats Mudbox in the broad array of its tools and brushes. However, the main drawback of Mudbox is its reliance on conventional 3D modeling software (Maya or <a href="#3ds%20Max">3ds Max</a>) to create and manipulate base geometry, whereas ZBrush is completely self-sufficient in this regard. Thus it's mostly a matter of your own workflow if you consider Mudbox superior to ZBrush.</p>
<p>In order to print your 3D design, you will have to process it in Maya or <a href="#3ds%20Max">3ds Max</a>, as Mudbox does not export to stl.</p>

<p>Poser is the second character creation tool on this list of 3D modeling software that has a few aces up its sleeve.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional 3D modeling programs, you create 3D models of humans and animals quickly and intuitively by manipulating a “base figure” – an ageless, genderless humanoid 3D file. You flesh out a distinctive and convincing character by sliding bars that control the features of the face, the torso, the arms and legs etc. The customizations extend to the finest details of the human body and, with enough practice, it is possible to create photorealistic 3D models.</p>
<p>Not only can you cloth your Poser character, you can even place objects from a large library pre-built characters, animals and props that alone is 5GB in size. This way, it is easy to equip and arrange entire scenes. But not only that, this 3D modeling software even has some decent rendering capabilities that included caustics, you get volumetric materials – so by purchasing Poser you are independent from any other programs. Exporting your work to 3ds Max or some other general purpose 3D modeling software is optional.</p>
<p>As in MakeHuman, the character is pre-rigged and ready for animation in movies and games. However, the pro version of Poser even allows you to record motion capture data using a Microsoft Kinect.

<p>Rhino3D is a 3D modeling software used in processes of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and reverse engineering in industries including architecture, industrial design (e.g. automotive design, watercraft design), product design (e.g. jewelry design), as well as for multimedia and graphic design.</p>
<p>The geometry of this 3D modeling software is based on the NURBS mathematical model, which focuses on producing a mathematically precise representation of curves and freeform surfaces in computer graphics (as opposed to polygon mesh-based applications). You will recognize many tools from <a href="#Moment%20of%20Inspiration">MoI</a>, which is in fact based on the same principles as Rhino3D. In comparison, during the 3D design process, you will often enter numbers in order to exactly place and shape models. On the one hand, this makes Rhino3D the perfect tool for mechanical designs, on the other, it also slows down the workflow a bit.</p>
<p>While Rhino3D has no dedicated tools for 3D printing the built in features are more than sufficient. For instance, your model to be printable, great care has to be given to the meshing of the NURBS model. Which can be minutely controlled from within Rhino3D itself. In addition, some online printing services offer plugins that facilitate the necessary preparations for printing and the upload from within the 3D modeling software.</p>

<div class="rich-text">
<p>A new take on the process of modeling was introduced by tools like ZBrush, which incorporates concepts known from clay sculpting into the realm of 3D modeling software.</p>
<p>The developers at Pixologic have made their name with a series of handy techniques that simplify the modeling workflow. For instance, ZBrush is capable of creating a new model with a higher, uniform polygon distribution to counter the effects of polygon stretching.</p>
<p>The main concept to grasp is often called »progressive detailing«. That means you don't try to create a high-resolution mesh right from the start. But build up levels of detail step by step. In practice, you will either start out with a primitive that you mold into your 3D design from scratch or load template (a generic human body etc.) as a basis. The groundwork is always to define the silhouette (arms, heads, limbs) in very broad brushes. From there you can switch to smaller brushes and sculpt large details, pronounced muscles, fingers and the like. Only then you can add intricate details like wrinkles or scars using finer brushes.</p>
<p>Though the idea of sculpting in 3D space may sound appealing to beginners, ZBrush is by no means a 3D modeling software you can master intuitively. ZBrush has a steep learning curve, it takes many hours of practice to master its many brushes and tools – only then will you produce satisfying results.</p>
<p>Although ZBrush and its competitor <a href="#Mudbox">Mudbox</a> both draw on the same concept, they implement it slightly differently. With many critics calling Mudbox somewhat friendlier for beginners in 3D sculpting. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that ZBrush beats Mudbox in the broad array of its tools and brushes. However, the main drawback of Mudbox is its reliance on either Maya or <a href="#3ds%20Max">3ds Max</a> to create base geometry, whereas ZBrush is completely self-sufficient in this regard. You can block out your silhouette very quickly in ZBrush, in addition, it lets you create additional geometry easily and intuitively. Whether you consider Mudox superior to ZBrush, is ultimately a matter of your own workflow.</p>
<p>Printing your three-dimensional sculptures is facilitated by the plugin “3D Print Exporter” – here you can decide on the scale of your model and the format. Check your printer or printing service if they are able to print your model at the same resolution as ZBrush!</p>
<p>If you want to print natural shapes and you're not scared to take the effort to delve into this technique – this 3D modeling software may be the way to go. Those who are not sure if the investment is worth it, can get their feet wet with <a href="#Sculptris">Sculptris</a>, a free program by the same developers, that has similar though fewer features than ZBrush.</p>

<p>CATIA is an acronym for Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application. The multi-platform application wears three hats; firstly as 3D CAD software, secondly as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software, and thirdly as a computer-aided engineering (CAE) software suite. The 3D modeling software is written in the C++ programming language and developed by the French company Dassault Systèmes. It is applied in fields like industrial design and mechanical engineering; specifically automotive, shipbuilding, industrial equipment, and architecture.</p>
<p>Similar to its competitor <a href="#Inventor">Autodesk Inventor</a>, CATIA not only requires extensive training to make the most its potential, but also advanced knowledge in engineering. Still, it is a highly advanced engineering tool and definitely one of the best 3D modeling software on the market.</p>

<div class="rich-text">
<p>Fusion 360 is a 3D CAD/CAM software tool with professional capabilities but is far more user-friendly than other professional solid-body 3D modeling software. The program encompasses the whole process of planning, testing and executing a 3D design. It has powerful parametric tools and analytic mesh tools that are well-suited to most challenges in industrial design. Moreover, it is able to simulate both the construction of the components designed as well as the stresses they will face once they are put to their use. Fusion 360 is also set apart by its collaborative features. It supports cloud-based file sharing, version control and import/export of common CAD file types.</p>
<p>Of course, Fusion 360 has excellent support for 3D printing. Models are directly imported into the Autodesk Printing Studio, that guides the user comfortably to a 3D printable file. Here you find the necessary tools to repair your mesh, if need be, and a preview of the printing process.</p>
<p>Though one of the best 3D modeling software tools for 3D design and engineering specialists, Fusion 360 requires extensive training to make the most its potential and advanced knowledge in engineering.</p>

Orchard </h3><img src="https://all3dp.com/app/uploads/2017/06/orchard.jpg">

<div class="rich-text">
<p>A rather novel take on 3D modeling that streamlines the concept of remixing designs that sites like Thinigverse handle somewhat clumsily. Crowd-sourcing designs through its browser-based modeling app, any modifications made to a design are viewable on the original's page, visually represented as a branching tree of derivatives. It's a cool concept but it appears a little barren right now, propped up by the founders and a small handful of designers. Once you're signed up, you can download free 3D models for printing for yourself (though there's no printability checker, so best to run it through a repair tool first).</p>

<h3>
<a id="addendum"></a>Which Free 3D Models are Suited for My Application?</h3>
<h3>Free 3D Models for Architecture/Engineering</h3><p>You want to ensure that the 3D models are true to scale. They should be accurate and provide documentation on the materials to be used and to clear up any potential misconceptions. The CAD models used for planning are not to be confused with the ones for architectural visualization. Architects design buildings down to the tiniest detail, stuffing them with kilometers of wiring, heating and everything else that makes skyscrapers, hospitals function. The 3D models used for visualization are downgraded to the facade and some key interior spaces.</p>
<h3>Free 3D Models for 3D Printing</h3><p>If you intend to 3D print a 3D model, make sure the mesh is watertight, and its vertices are non-manifold. Also, check the wall thickness for efficient use of material. You want a sturdy print, but don't waste precious filament.</p>
<h3>Free 3D Models for Gaming</h3><p>Video games try to square the circle. Their ambition is a high degree of realism, but they also utilize real-time rendering. One way to achieve this goal is to lower the polygon count. So 3D modelers often remove parts and hide them from the player's point of view.</p>
<h3>Free 3D Models for Graphic Design/Visual Effects</h3><p>Visualand graphic designers aim at a high degree of realism. But as their works are pre-rendered, they are in a very comfortable position. They can allow themselves a substantially higher polygon count. In CG-animation the quality of the bo3e structure is paramount. You want to configure the kinematics of your mesh without encountering any issues.</p>
