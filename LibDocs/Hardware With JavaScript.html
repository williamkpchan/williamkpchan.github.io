<h2>Quick summary</h2>
The <em>Internet of Things</em> (IoT) has enabled the Internet to reach beyond the browser. 
Made up of electronically networked devices, these “things” are able to <strong>interact with the physical world</strong> via sensors that feed data they capture back into their ecosystems.

Currently, these devices are mostly products, designed with a specific purpose in mind, a typical example being a fitness band that tracks activity. 
It reports the information gathered to an app, which is then able to analyze the data and offer suggestions and motivation to push the user further.

When building IoT devices, the task is typically divided between two roles: A hardware engineer creates the physical device, and a developer the ecosystem. 

However, this is not always necessary. 
In the case of JavaScript, its <strong>isomorphic nature</strong> allows for one language to be used across multiple platforms — including hardware.

<h2>Hello World</h2>
<h3>The Hardware</h3>
<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ffea23f5-71bc-4a59-802a-c7bcecf71d22/image03-opt.jpg">

<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/27a9d99d-5197-475f-aaac-7349f3d3f93e/image16-opt.png">

To start the circuit, connect a jumper wire from pin 10 on the Arduino. 
This is the point at which the Arduino starts talking to the circuit. 
You can use any numbered pin from the right side of the Arduino — just make sure your code refers to the correct one.
To make sure the ideal amount of current flows through the LED, the resistor is needed. 

Unlike the LED, it doesn’t matter which way it is inserted into the circuit.
Whether pin 10 is allowing current through or not (controlled by your code) will determine whether the LED is on or off.
Another jumper wire then connects to the negative side of the LED and returns to ground to complete the circuit. 
Simple!

Once completed, your circuit should look something like the image below. 
Plug this into your computer via USB. 
The next task is to set up the Arduino to work with JavaScript.
<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/15504e20-747a-47c4-b69b-084a593761a6/image07-opt.jpg">

This is how your circuit should look when built.
Before writing any software, we need to make sure the Arduino has the <strong>correct firmware</strong> so that it will work with JavaScript. 
The firmware essentially exposes an API for the computer, so that the code can interact with the board through the USB port.
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Download and install</a> the integrated development environment (IDE) from the Arduino website. 

Next open up the IDE, ensuring your Arduino is plugged in via USB.
Before running anything, you also need to check that you have the correct USB port. 
Go to “Tools” → “Port.” The names can differ, so a good rule is to choose a port that has “tty” and “usb” in its name on Mac OS X and “COM” on Windows.
Once completed, you can now upload the firmware. 

Select “File” → “Examples” → “Firmata” → “Standard Firmata.” Once done, select “File” → “Upload on Mac” (or “Sketch” → “Upload on Windows”).
<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/26c8b349-339f-49a3-9ce5-9e1ffd74d4d4/image15-opt.png">
Finding the right firmware can be tricky; this is where you will find it.
Now it’s time to write some JavaScript!

<h3>The Software</h3>
To control the LED with JavaScript, we will need to use a library built for Node.js called <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Johnny-Five</a>. 
Basically, it&rsquo;s a library built by the team at <a href="https://bocoup.com/">Bocoup</a> to make building hardware more accessible to the web community. 

Because the core of our example uses an Arduino, this library allows our machine to connect to the hardware through the USB port.
To get started, you will need to have Node.js installed. 

All of the code featured in this article is <a href="https://github.com/jimhunty/Hardware-Hacking-with-JavaScript">available on GitHub</a>.
To install all of the dependencies required for this project, you will need to create a <code>package.json</code> file, which can be taken from the code below. 
This is a shopping <strong>list of the libraries required</strong> to get the example running. 

When the <code>install</code> command is initialized, npm will go out and get all of the ingredients needed for everything to run. 
This file must be in your root folder.
<code>{

  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "johnny-five": "^0.9.13"
  }
}</code>

In your command-line tool, ensure that you are in the same folder that you created for this example with the <code>package.json</code> file; then, run <code>npm install</code>. 
If you don’t have the permissions to install these packages, use <code>sudo npm install</code> instead.
Now, you need to create the application code to run our example. 

We have named this file <code>blink-led.js</code>. 
The comments detail what is going on.
<code>// Johnny-Five is our JavaScript framework for accessing Arduino.
var jfive = require("johnny-five");

var board, led;
board = new jfive.Board();
// Similar to jQuery, we wait for the board to be ready.
board.on("ready", function() {

  // 10 represents the pin number that the LED is plugged into.
  led = new jfive.Led(10)
  // The LED blinks (i.e. 
turns on and off) every 1000 milliseconds.

  led.blink(1000);
});</code>

First, the libraries are loaded, then the variables are initialized. 
A new <code>Board</code> instance is created using the constructor, and the <code>on ready</code> function will get the board warmed up and ready to receive instructions. 

Because you plugged the jumper cable that connects to the LED into pin 10, it needs to be defined in the <code>led</code> variable. 
The <code>blink</code> method is then used to turn the light on and off, in 1-second phases.
You now have everything you need to get this light show started — crank up the music! Make sure your Arduino is plugged in and the circuit is all set up. 
In the command line, run <code>node blink-led.js</code>, replacing the file name with whatever you have called your code. 

You should now have a blinking light.
Try modifying the code to make the light blink faster or slower. 
Each time you do, you will need to restart your code in the Terminal. 
You may wish to try <code>led.pulse()</code>; this will fade the LED in and out, instead of just switching with no transition.

<h2>Home Monitoring</h2>
Already you’ve learned a lot! Now you can put this knowledge to use and <strong>build a simple home-monitoring system</strong>, similar to commercial products like Nest and Hive.
This time, you’re going to be using a temperature sensor, connected to the Arduino from the Node.js server. 
The temperature will be read by the sensor and fed into a browser that will display the data on a simple web page.

<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fa07bf0b-1199-40bf-a4ce-0ee488196341/image08-opt.jpg">
The page’s background color reflects the temperature.
<h3>The Hardware</h3>
You will need:

1 × Arduino UNO
1 × solderless breadboard
1 × TMP36 temperature sensor
3 × jumper cables

The temperature sensor chosen for this example is available in most starter kits and is incredibly cheap to purchase individually.

Components needed to build the home-monitoring project.
With the previous LED blink example, you set up the connection between the Node.js server running on the computer and the Arduino. 

This connection can also be used to read data from sensors connected to the Arduino.

A schematic of the home-monitoring circuit.
Above is the completed circuit. 

Try to match this pin for pin.
Be careful when handling the temperature sensor because it is easy to get the legs mixed up. 
The flat side of the component is the front and should be facing towards you as you wire up the sensor. 
Because each of the three legs has a different purpose, wiring them incorrectly will mean your circuit will not work.

The analog input pins are the five pins lined up along the left side of the board. 
The Arduino has both analog and digital pins, both input and output. 
Digital means there are only two states — on and off (or electric signal and no electrical signal) — and are great for buttons and other binary switches that interpret only two states. 
Analog input, on the other hand, can represent a <strong>range of values</strong>, and the analog input pins on the Arduino can measure any voltage between 0 and 5 volts (and produce a 10-bit value of that reading). 

The temperature reading from the sensor will be returned in a variable resistance measurement that is proportional to the air temperature.
Connect the signal pin in the middle of the sensor to the analog input A0. 
Connect the left pin to the 5V pin (positive) and the right pin to ground (negative) to complete the circuit.

The completed home-monitoring circuit.
Your circuit should now look something like the picture above. 
Next, you need to create a new file to read the temperature sensor. 
This file will start in the same way as in the previous example, loading the Johnny-Five library, initializing a new board instance and then adding an <code>on ready</code> event listener.

<code>var jfive = require("johnny-five");
board = new jfive.Board();
board.on("ready", function() {
  // We create a new sensor instance and define the sensor type and the pin it’s connected to.

  var tempSensor = new jfive.Thermometer({
    controller: "TMP36",
    pin: "A0"
  });

   // We add an event listener to the sensor and handle the incoming data.
  tempSensor.on("data", function() {
    // The data object also has a fahrenheit property, if that’s what we are after.
    console.log(this.celsius + "°C");

  });  
});</code>

Save this piece of code as <code>temperature.js</code>, and run it from the console by typing in <code>node temperature.js</code>.
Because <code>console.log</code> was used in the code, the readings will be outputted to the Terminal for debugging.

<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/99cd36ec-1bda-4516-9191-060589267694/image12-opt.png">
Temperature data should start to print out very fast.
<h3>Servers and Sockets</h3>
Now you have a working thermometer running in Node.js. 

This simple example alone opens up a whole range of possibilities if you consider all of the different Node.js modules available to process and use this data. 
You could save this to a Google Spreadsheet, tweet or write about it, or even stream this data to the browser in real time with WebSockets — which is what you are going to do next!
<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a3fc286c-67cd-4b20-a6d9-d2cb61317b3e/image01-opt.png">
Flow of data from each device.

To establish the connection with the browser and to stream the sensor data, we’ll need to start a Node.js HTTP server to serve our HTML document, and then open the WebSocket connection between them. 
Starting up a web server in Node.js is relatively simple with the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> library. 
First, install it from the Terminal:
<code>npm install --save express</code>


Once it’s installed, these lines of code will instantiate the server:
<code>// Load libraries and then initialize the server.
var app = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(app);

// When the user requests the root of the page (/), we respond with index.html.
app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

// We listen for connections on port 3000.
http.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});</code>


Save this as a <code>server.js</code> file.
In this server code, the first two lines load the required libraries and create an HTTP server instance. 
Next, simple routing logic serves the <code>index.html</code> file from the project’s folder when the user requests the root (<code>/</code>). 
Finally, port <code>3000</code> listens for connections.

To test this, create a standard <code>index.html</code> file in the root of the project’s folder. 
In the command line, navigate to your project’s folder and type <code>node server.js</code>. 
If you then type <code>http://localhost:3000</code> or the IP address of your machine and the port (for example, <code>http://190.140.0.00:3000</code>) in a browser, you should see your standard <code>index.html</code> page. 
This means your server is all set up.

This was definitely easier than configuring an Apache server!
Before merging this piece of code with the <code>temperature.js</code> file, we’re going to set up the WebSocket connection.
A WebSocket makes it possible to open a communication session between the browser and the server. 
With this API, you can send two-way real-time messages and receive event-driven responses without having to poll for a reply. 

<a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> is the Node.js module that you are going to use to establish and handle this connection. 
Install Socket.IO just like you installed Express and Johnny-Five:
<code>npm install --save socket.io</code>

Notice how your <code>package.json</code> file is now updated with Express and Socket.IO under dependencies? This means that whoever wishes to run your application from their machine can simply run <code>npm install</code>, and all of the module dependencies that you loaded will be installed at once. 

Nice! Now you can add the WebSocket functionality to the working <code>server.js</code> code. 
Below is the full example:
<code>var app = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(app);

// Load the Socket.IO library.
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.sendfile('index.html');

});
// Establish the WebSocket connection with the browser.
io.on('connection', function(socket){
  console.log('a user connected');

});
http.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});</code>


First, Socket.IO is loaded, and then an <code>on connection</code> event listener is created. 
This will be triggered when a user loads the <code>index.html</code> file.
On the <code>index.html</code> page, the Socket.IO client-side library needs to be initialized in order to talk with the server. 
To prepare your HTML file for this, add the piece of code below right before the closing <code>body</code> tag:

<code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var socket = io();
&lt;/script&gt;</code>


The connection should now be set up, and you should see the “A user has connected” message in the command line upon loading the index page via the localhost link.
Now, you can send messages to the browser from the server with the <code>socket.emit()</code> function. 
You can do this by replacing the previous function in <code>server.js</code>:
<code>io.on('connection', function(socket){

  console.log('a user connected');
  socket.emit('Server message', “Hello from the server!”);
});</code>

This is how you need to modify <code>index.html</code> to receive the message:

<code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var socket = io();
  socket.on('Server message’, function (message) {

   console.log(message);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code>

If you’ve done everything correctly, you should see the “Hello from the server!” message in your browser’s console. 

Congratulations! This means you have set up a real-time WebSocket connection between a Node.js HTTP server and a browser!
This is really quite useful, and not just for this project. 
A WebSocket connection can be used to communicate between multiple browsers to create chat applications, multiplayer games and much more!
<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c6a2f611-a630-491f-a084-6bb70c8862af/image10-opt.png">

WebSockets enabled! You are now connected.
Now it’s time to merge the <code>temperature.js</code> file, which handles communication with the Arduino, with our new WebSocket server code, which is responsible for connecting to the browser.
This requires extending <code>server.js</code>:
<code>var app = require('express')();

var http = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
var jfive = require("johnny-five");
var board = new jfive.Board();

var board, socket,
      connected = false;
app.get('/', function(req, res){
   res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');

});
io.on('connection', function(s){
   console.log('A user has connected');
   // Tracking connection

   connected = true;
   // Saving this for the board on ready callback function
   socket = s;
});

board.on("ready", function() {
   console.log('board has connected');    
   var tempSensor = new jfive.Thermometer({
      controller: "TMP36",

      pin: "A0"
   });
   tempSensor.on("data", function() {
      // We send the temperature when the browser is connected.

      if(connected) socket.emit('Temperature reading', this.celsius);
   }); 
});
http.listen(3000, function(){

   console.log('listening on *:3000');
});</code>

Here, you have simply copied over from <code>temperature.js</code> the line that loads Johnny-Five and initializes the board, as well as the whole <code>board on ready</code> function.
You’ve also added two new variables: one to keep track of WebSocket connections and another to store the socket instance for other functions to be accessible — in this case, for the <code>board on ready</code> function that uses it to send and receive messages.

Now, the <code>index.html</code> file needs to be updated to handle the data coming through the socket connection <code>Temperature reading</code>. 
The code below needs to be added to the HTML document within the script elements where the <code>Server message</code> handler previously existed.
<code>socket.on('Temperature reading', function (message) {
console.log(message);

});</code>

<h3>The Interface</h3>
The last thing to do is add a few lines of HTML and CSS to <code>index.html</code> to display the temperature reading in a user-friendly way. 
You’re also going to update the background color, making it change between blue (cold) and orange (hot), according to the temperature. 

The HTML is very simple: just one <code>h1</code> element to hold the number.
The following needs to be added to the <code>body</code>.
<code>&lt;h1&gt;0ºC&lt;/h1&gt;</code>

A large thin typeface should work very well with the numbers; try Lato, a free font from the Google Fonts library. 

Load this in the <code>head</code> section of the document:
<code>&lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;</code>

The styling is minimal in this example. 
The only tricky bit is the way the <code>temperature</code> label is loaded. 

It grabs the class name with the <code>content</code> CSS property and adds it to the <code>:before</code> pseudo-element.
<code>body {
    background-color: hsl(0, 60%, 65%);
    transition: background-color 1s;

}
h1 {
    font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
    font-size: 120px;
    font-weight: 100;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 60px;

}
h1:before{
  content: attr(class) ":";
  font-size: 22px;
  position: relative;
  top: -69px;
  left: 0;
  text-transform: uppercase;

}</code>

<img class="lazy" src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7f3dfbcd-d099-493e-86b2-19d4180a8d2a/image09-opt.png">
You are now sending temperature data in real time to your interface. 
Project complete!

This looks pretty already!
To finish it off, add a few lines of JavaScript to update the values when receiving the WebSocket message, and to change the background color.
<code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

  var socket = io(),
  temperature = document.querySelector(".temperature");
  socket.on('Temperature reading', function(message) {
      // Rounding down the decimal values and adding ºC 
      temperature.innerHTML = parseInt(message) + "ºC";
      // Calculating the hue for the background color and changing it
      var hue = 200 - (parseInt(message) * 5);
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = "hsl(" + hue + ", 60%, 65%)";

  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code>

You’re done! The Arduino temperature readings will now show in real time in the browser.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

While the prospect of building your own hardware can be daunting, hopefully, after working through these two examples, you’re already thinking about the possibilities and planning your next project. 
Many components are compatible with the Johnny-Five library, meaning that the only limit is your imagination.
