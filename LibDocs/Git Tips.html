'<h2>What is a codespace?</h2>A codespace is a development environment that\'s hosted in the cloud. \nYou can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.\n\nEach codespace runs on a virtual machine hosted by GitHub. \nYou can choose the type of machine you want to use, depending on the resources you need. \nVarious types of machine are available, starting with a 2-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of storage. \n\nYou can connect to your codespaces from your browser, from Visual Studio Code, from the JetBrains Gateway application, or by using GitHub CLI.\n<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-89172/images/help/codespaces/codespaces-diagram.png">\n',

'<h2>put multiple projects in a git repository Solution 1</h2>A single repository can contain multiple <em>independent</em> branches, called <i>orphan branches</i>.\nOrphan branches are completely separate from each other; they do not share histories.\n<i>git checkout --orphan BRANCHNAME</i>\nThis creates a new branch, unrelated to your current branch.\nEach project should be in its own orphaned branch.\nNow for whatever reason, git needs a bit of cleanup after an orphan checkout.\n<i>rm .git/index\nrm -r *</i>\n<i>Make sure everything is committed before deleting</i>\nOnce the orphan branch is clean, you can use it normally.',
'<h2>put multiple projects in a git repository Solution 2</h2>Avoid all the hassle of orphan branches.\nCreate two independent repositories, and push them to the same remote.\nJust use different branch names for each repo.\n<i># repo 1\ngit push origin master:master-1\n# repo 2\ngit push origin master:master-2</i>',
'<h2>put multiple projects in a git repository Solution 3</h2>This is for using a single directory for multiple projects.\nI use this technique for some closely related projects where I often need to pull changes from one project into another.\nIt\'s similar to the orphaned branches idea but the branches don\'t need to be orphaned.\nSimply start all the projects from the same empty directory state.<h4>Start all projects from one committed empty directory</h4>\nDon\'t expect wonders from this solution.\nAs I see it, you are always going to have annoyances with untracked files.\nGit doesn\'t really have a clue what to do with them and so if there are intermediate files generated by a compiler and ignored by your .gitignore file, it is likely that they will be left hanging some of the time if you try rapidly swapping between - for example - your software project and a PH.D thesis project.\nHowever here is the plan.\nStart as you ought to start any git projects, by committing the empty repository, and then start all your projects from the same empty directory state.\nThat way you are certain that the two lots of files are fairly independent.\nAlso, give your branches a proper name and don\'t lazily just use "master".\nYour projects need to be separate so give them appropriate names.\nGit commits (and hence tags and branches) basically store the state of a directory and its subdirectories and <i>Git has no idea whether these are parts of the same or different projects</i> so really there is no problem for git storing different projects in the same repository.\nThe problem is then for you clearing up the untracked files from one project when using another, or separating the projects later.',

Clone Repository.\nIn the confirmation dialog, select Open GitHub Desktop.app.\n\nGitHub Desktop should launch with a “Clone a Repository” dialog box about where to clone the repository.\n\nIf desired, you can change the Local Path.\nClick the URL tab, and then paste in the clone URL.\n\nIn the Local Path field, select where you want the repo cloned.\n\nFor example:\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/localpathgithubdesktop.png">\nSelecting paths for the repo in GitHub Desktop\nClick Clone.\nGo into the repository where GitHub Desktop cloned the repo (use your Finder or browse the folders with Finder or Explorer) and either add a simple text file with some content or make a change to an existing file.\nGo back to GitHub Desktop.\n\nYou’ll see the new file you added in the list of uncommitted changes on the left.\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/github-desktop-file-uncommitted-changes.png">\nUncommitted changes shown\nIn the list of changed files, the green + means you’ve added a new file.\n\nA yellow circle means you’ve modified an existing file.\nIn the lower-left corner of the GitHub Desktop client (where it says “Summary” and “Description”), type a commit message, and then click Commit to master.\nWhen you commit the changes, the left pane no longer shows the list of uncommitted changes.\n\nHowever, you’ve committed the changes only locally.\n\nYou still have to push the commit to the remote (origin) repository.\n\n(“origin” is the alias name that refers to the remote repository.)\nClick Push origin at the top.\nYou’ll see GitHub Desktop show that it’s “Pushing to origin.”\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/pushingtoorigin.png">\nIf you view your repository online, you’ll see that the change you made has been pushed to the master branch on origin.\n\nYou can also click the History tab in the GitHub Desktop client (instead of the Changes tab), or go to View &gt; Show History to see the changes you previously committed.\nAlthough I prefer to use the terminal instead of the GitHub Desktop GUI, the GUI gives you an easier visual experience to see the changes made to a repository.\n\nYou can use both the command line and Desktop client in combination, if you want.<h3 id="GitHubDesktoptopic-1">Create a branch</h3>Now let’s create a branch, make some changes, and see how the changes are specific to that branch.\nIn the GitHub Desktop client, go to Branch &gt; New Branch and create a new branch.\n\nCall it “development” branch, and click Create Branch.\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/creatingnewbranchgithubdesktop.png">\nCreating a new branch\nWhen you create the branch, you’ll see the Current branch drop-down menu indicate that you’re working in that branch.\n\nCreating a branch copies the existing content (from the branch you’re currently in, <em>master</em>) into the new branch (<em>development</em>).\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/github-desktop-current-branch.png">\nWorking in a branch\nUsing Finder or Explorer, browse to the file you created earlier and make a change to it, such as adding a new line with some text.\n\nSave the changes.\nReturn to GitHub Desktop and notice that on the Changes tab, you have new modified files.\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/github-desktop-file-changes.png">\nNew files modified\nThe file changes show deleted lines in red and new lines in green.\n\nThe colors help you see what changed.\nCommit the changes using the options in the lower-left corner, and click Commit to development.\nClick Publish branch (on the top of the GitHub Desktop window) to make the local branch also available on origin (GitHub).\n\n(Remember, there are usually two versions of a branch — the local version and the remote version.)\nSwitch back to your master branch (using the Branch drop-down option at the top of the GitHub Desktop client).\n\nThen look at your file (in your text editor, such as Sublime text).\n\nNote how the file changes you made while editing in the development branch don’t appear in your master branch.\nYou usually create a new branch when you’re making extensive changes to your content.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to revamp a section (“Section X”) in your docs.\n\nHowever, you might want to publish other updates before publishing the extensive changes in Section X.\n\nIf you were working in the same branch, it would be difficult to selectively push updates on a few files outside of Section X without pushing updates you’ve made to files in Section X as well.\nThrough branching, you can confine your changes to a specific version that you don’t push live until you’re ready to merge the changes into your master branch.<h3 id="GitHubDesktoptopic-2">Merge the development branch into master</h3>Now let’s merge the development branch into the master branch.\nIn the GitHub Desktop client, switch to the branch you want to merge the development branch into.\n\nFrom the branch selector, select the master branch.\nGo to Branch &gt;

To do this, we’ll create a pull request.\nJust as you did in the previous section, switch to the development branch, make some updates to the content in a file, and then save and commit the changes.\n\nAfter committing the changes, click Push origin to push your changes to the remote version of the development branch on GitHub.\nIn the GitHub Desktop client, while you have development branch selected, go to Branch &gt; Create Pull Request.\nGitHub opens in the browser with the Pull Request form opened.\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/mergepullrequestgithubdesktop.png">\nPull request\nThe left-facing arrow (pointing from the development branch towards the master) indicates that the pull request (“PR”) wants to merge the development branch into the master branch.\nDescribe the pull request, and then click Create pull request.\nAt this point, engineers would get an email request asking for them to merge in the edits.\n\nPlay the part of the engineer by going to the Pull requests tab (on GitHub) to examine and confirm the merge request.\n\nAs long as the merge request doesn’t pose any conflicts, you’ll see a Merge pull request button.\n<img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/api/mergepullrequest.png">\nConfirm merge request\nTo see what changes you’re merging into master, you can click the Files changed tab (which appears on the secondary navigation bar near the top).\n\nThen click Merge pull request to merge in the branch, and click Confirm merge to complete the merge.\nNow let’s get the updates you merged into the masterbranch online into your local copy.\n\nIn your GitHub Desktop GUI client, select the master branch, and then click the Fetch origin button.\n\nFetch gets the latest updates from origin but doesn’t update your local working copy with the changes.\nAfter you click Fetch origin, the button changes to Pull Origin.\nClick Pull Origin to update your local working copy with the fetched updates.\nNow check your files and notice that the updates that were originally in the development branch now appear in master.\nFor a more detailed tutorial in making pull requests using the GitHub interface, see <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_github_pull_requests.html">Pull request workflows through GitHub</a>.\n\nI include an extensive tutorial with pull requests because it will likely be a common workflow if you are <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_find_open_source_project.html">contributing to an open-source project</a>.<h3 id="GitHubDesktoptopic-4">Managing merge conflicts</h3>Suppose you make a change on your local copy of a file in the repository, and someone else changes the same file using the online GitHub.com browser interface.\n\nThe changes conflict with each other.\n\nWhat happens?\nWhen you click Push origin from the GitHub Desktop client, you’ll see a message saying that the repository has been updated since you last pulled:\n<blockquote>\n“The repository has been updated since you last pulled.\n\nTry pulling before pushing.”\n</blockquote>\nThe button that previously said “Push origin” now says “Pull origin.” Click Pull origin.\n\nYou now get another error message that says,\n<blockquote>\n“We found some conflicts while trying to merge.\n\nPlease resolve the conflicts and commit the changes.”\n</blockquote>\nIf you decide to commit your changes, you’ll see a message that says:\n<blockquote>\n“Please resolve all conflicted files, commit, and then try syncing again.”\n</blockquote>\nThe GitHub Desktop client displays an exclamation mark next to files with merge conflicts.\n\nOpen up a conflict file and look for the conflict markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;).\n\nFor example, you might see this:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nThis is an edit I made locally.\n=======\nThis is an edit I made from the browser.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; c163ead57f6793678dd41b5efeef372d9bd81035\n(From the command line, you can also run git status to see which files have conflicts.) The content in HEAD shows your local changes.\n\nThe content below the ======= shows changes made by elsewhere.\nFix all the conflicts by adjusting the content between the content markers and then deleting the content markers.\n\nFor example, update the content to this:\nThis is an edit I made locally.\nNow you need to re-add the file to Git again.\n\nIn the GitHub Desktop client, commit your changes to the updated files.\n\nThen click Push origin.\n\nThe updates on your local get pushed to the remote without any more conflicts.<h3 id="GitHubDesktoptopic-5">Conclusion</h3>The more you use GitHub, the more familiar you’ll become with the workflows you need.\n\nGit is a robust, powerful collaboration platform, and there are many commands and workflows and features that you could adopt for a variety of scenarios.\n\nDespite Git’s variety of commands and workflows, most likely the scenarios you’ll actually use are somewhat limited in scope and learnable without too much effort.\n\nPretty soon, these workflows will become automatic.\nAlthough we’ve been using the GitHub Desktop client for this exercise, you can do all of this through the command line, and you’ll probably find it preferable that way.\n\nHowever, the GitHub Desktop client can be a good starting point as you transition into becoming more of a Git power user.\n',

'<h2>Git to avoid typing username password</h2>Two approaches can be used.\n\nSSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords.\nOne needs to generate an SSH key and add the public key to your GitHub account.\nA guide on how to set up SSH key can be found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>\nBut this is not the main focus for this article.\n\nThe key question remains:\n<strong>Is there a way to skip typing my username and/password when using HTTPS in GitHub?</strong>\nThe answer is yes.\nThis is done by using <em>credential helpers.\n</em>And this is the second approach.\nCredential helpers basically tells Git to remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.\n\nThe syntax is given by:\ngit config credential.https://example.com.username myusername\ngit config credential.helper “$helper $options”\nTherefore, credential helpers are external programs from which Git can request both usernames and passwords.\nCredential helpers are in two forms: <em>cache</em> which caches credentials in memory for a short period of time, and <em>store</em> which basically stores credentials indefinitely on disk.\nOnce you have selected the helper, you can tell Git to use it by putting its name into the credential.helper variable.\n\nFind a helper:\ngit help -a | grep credential-credential-foo\n2. Read its description.\n git help credential-foo\n3. Tell Git to use it.\ngit config — global credential.helper foo\nAssuming you have a remote with the following URL<strong><em> https://github.com/adambajumba/MestEIT</em></strong>,\nupdate the Git configuration to use the helper whenever it needs authentication steps:\n$ git config --global credential.\nhttps://github.com/myusername/mysecretproject.username \your_github_account_name$ git config --global credential.\nhttps://github.com/adambajumba/MestEIT.adambajumba \IsaacJumba\nNote that the remote URL is appended with a trailing .username fragment which becomes the key and the GitHub username becomes the value.\nOnce the username is set, map the helper: And you are done! That easy, right?\n$ git config --global core.askpass ~/.git_credential_helper.rb\nAn example of how it works would be:\n$ git config credential.helper store\n$ git push http://example.com/repo.git\nUsername: &lt;type your username&gt;\nPassword: &lt;type your password&gt;<strong>[several days later]</strong>\n$ git push http://example.com/repo.git\n[your credentials are used automatically]\nIn conclusion, the credential helper does not work in all versions of git but from version 1.8 and above.\n',
'<h2>Git Tools - Credential Storage</h2>If you use the SSH transport for connecting to remotes, it’s possible for you to have a key without a passphrase, which allows you to securely transfer data without typing in your username and password.\nHowever, this isn’t possible with the HTTP protocols – every connection needs a username and password.\nThis gets even harder for systems with two-factor authentication, where the token you use for a password is randomly generated and unpronounceable.\n\nFortunately, Git has a credentials system that can help with this.\nGit has a few options provided in the box:\nThe default is not to cache at all.\nEvery connection will prompt you for your username and password.\n\nThe “cache” mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of time.\nNone of the passwords are ever stored on disk, and they are purged from the cache after 15 minutes.\nThe “store” mode saves the credentials to a plain-text file on disk, and they never expire.\nThis means that until you change your password for the Git host, you won’t ever have to type in your credentials again.\n\nThe downside of this approach is that your passwords are stored in cleartext in a plain file in your home directory.\nIf you’re using a Mac, Git comes with an “osxkeychain” mode, which caches credentials in the secure keychain that’s attached to your system account.\nThis method stores the credentials on disk, and they never expire, but they’re encrypted with the same system that stores HTTPS certificates and Safari auto-fills.\nIf you’re using Windows, you can install a helper called “Git Credential Manager for Windows.”\n\nThis is similar to the “osxkeychain” helper described above, but uses the Windows Credential Store to control sensitive information.\nIt can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows">https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows</a>.\nYou can choose one of these methods by setting a Git configuration value:\n<i>$ git config --global credential.helper cache</i>\n\nSome of these helpers have options.\nThe “store” helper can take a <i>--file &lt;path&gt;</i> argument, which customizes where the plain-text file is saved (the default is <i>~/.git-credentials</i>).\nThe “cache” helper accepts the <i>--timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i> option, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept running (the default is “900”, or 15 minutes).\nHere’s an example of how you’d configure the “store” helper with a custom file name:\n\n<i>$ git config --global credential.helper \'store --file ~/.my-credentials\'</i>\nGit even allows you to configure several helpers.\nWhen looking for credentials for a particular host, Git will query them in order, and stop after the first answer is provided.\nWhen saving credentials, Git will send the username and password to <strong>all</strong> of the helpers in the list, and they can choose what to do with them.\n\nHere’s what a <i>.gitconfig</i> would look like if you had a credentials file on a thumb drive, but wanted to use the in-memory cache to save some typing if the drive isn’t plugged in:\n<i>[credential]\n    helper = store --file /mnt/thumbdrive/.git-credentials\n    helper = cache --timeout 30000</i>\n<h3>Under the Hood</h3>How does this all work?\nGit’s root command for the credential-helper system is <i>git credential</i>, which takes a command as an argument, and then more input through stdin.\nThis might be easier to understand with an example.\n\nLet’s say that a credential helper has been configured, and the helper has stored credentials for <i>mygithost</i>.\nHere’s a session that uses the “fill” command, which is invoked when Git is trying to find credentials for a host:\n<i>$ git credential fill <b>(1)</b>\nprotocol=https <b>(2)</b>\nhost=mygithost\n<b>(3)</b>\nprotocol=https <b>(4)</b>\nhost=mygithost\nusername=bob\npassword=s3cre7\n\n$ git credential fill <b>(5)</b>\nprotocol=https\nhost=unknownhost\nUsername for \'https://unknownhost\': bob\nPassword for \'https://bob@unknownhost\':\nprotocol=https\nhost=unknownhost\nusername=bob\npassword=s3cre7</i>\n\nThis is the command line that initiates the interaction.\nGit-credential is then waiting for input on stdin.\nWe provide it with the things we know: the protocol and hostname.\nA blank line indicates that the input is complete, and the credential system should answer with what it knows.\nGit-credential then takes over, and writes to stdout with the bits of information it found.\n\nIf credentials are not found, Git asks the user for the username and password, and provides them back to the invoking stdout (here they’re attached to the same console).\nThe credential system is actually invoking a program that’s separate from Git itself; which one and how depends on the <i>credential.helper</i> configuration value.\nThere are several forms it can take:\n<table>\n<colgroup><col style="width: 50%;"><col style="width: 50%;">\n</colgroup>\n<thead><tr><th>Configuration Value</th><th>Behavior</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><i>foo</i></td><td>Runs <i>git-credential-foo</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td><i>foo -a --opt=bcd</i></td><td>Runs <i>git-credential-foo -a --opt=bcd</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td><i>/absolute/path/foo -xyz</i></td><td>Runs <i>/absolute/path/foo -xyz</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td><i>!f() { echo "password=s3cre7"; }; f</i></td><td>Code after <i>!</i> evaluated in shell</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSo the helpers described above are actually named <i>git-credential-cache</i>, <i>git-credential-store</i>, and so on, and we can configure them to take command-line arguments.\nThe general form for this is “git-credential-foo [args] &lt;action&gt;.”\nThe stdin/stdout protocol is the same as git-credential, but they use a slightly different set of actions:\n<i>get</i> is a request for a username/password pair.\n<i>store</i> is a request to save a set of credentials in this helper’s memory.\n<i>erase</i> purge the credentials for the given properties from this helper’s memory.\nFor the <i>store</i> and <i>erase</i> actions, no response is required (Git ignores it anyway).\nFor the <i>get</i> action, however, Git is very interested in what the helper has to say.\n\nIf the helper doesn’t know anything useful, it can simply exit with no output, but if it does know, it should augment the provided information with the information it has stored.\nThe output is treated like a series of assignment statements; anything provided will replace what Git already knows.\nHere’s the same example from above, but skipping git-credential and going straight for git-credential-store:\n<i>$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store store <b>(1)</b>\n\nprotocol=https\nhost=mygithost\nusername=bob\npassword=s3cre7\n$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store get <b>(2)</b>\nprotocol=https\nhost=mygithost\nusername=bob <b>(3)</b>\npassword=s3cre7</i>\n\nHere we tell <i>git-credential-store</i> to save some credentials: the username “bob” and the password “s3cre7” are to be used when <i><a href="https://mygithost">https://mygithost</a></i> is accessed.\nNow we’ll retrieve those credentials.\nWe provide the parts of the connection we already know (<i><a href="https://mygithost">https://mygithost</a></i>), and an empty line.\n\n<i>git-credential-store</i> replies with the username and password we stored above.\nHere’s what the <i>~/git.store</i> file looks like:\n<i>https://bob:s3cre7@mygithost</i>\nIt’s just a series of lines, each of which contains a credential-decorated URL.\n\nThe <i>osxkeychain</i> and <i>wincred</i> helpers use the native format of their backing stores, while <i>cache</i> uses its own in-memory format (which no other process can read).<h3>A Custom Credential Cache</h3>Given that <i>git-credential-store</i> and friends are separate programs from Git, it’s not much of a leap to realize that <em>any</em> program can be a Git credential helper.\nThe helpers provided by Git cover many common use cases, but not all.\n\nFor example, let’s say your team has some credentials that are shared with the entire team, perhaps for deployment.\nThese are stored in a shared directory, but you don’t want to copy them to your own credential store, because they change often.\nNone of the existing helpers cover this case; let’s see what it would take to write our own.\nThere are several key features this program needs to have:\n\nThe only action we need to pay attention to is <i>get</i>; <i>store</i> and <i>erase</i> are write operations, so we’ll just exit cleanly when they’re received.\nThe file format of the shared-credential file is the same as that used by <i>git-credential-store</i>.\nThe location of that file is fairly standard, but we should allow the user to pass a custom path just in case.\nOnce again, we’ll write this extension in Ruby, but any language will work so long as Git can execute the finished product.\n\nHere’s the full source code of our new credential helper:\n<i>#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nrequire \'optparse\'\npath = File.expand_path \'~/.git-credentials\' # <b>(1)</b>\n\nOptionParser.new do |opts|\n    opts.banner = \'USAGE: git-credential-read-only [options] &lt;action&gt;\'\n    opts.on(\'-f\', \'--file PATH\', \'Specify path for backing store\') do |argpath|\n        path = File.expand_path argpath\n    end\nend.parse!\nexit(0) unless ARGV[0].downcase == \'get\' # <b>(2)</b>\nexit(0) unless File.exists? path\n\nknown = {} # <b>(3)</b>\nwhile line = STDIN.gets\n    break if line.strip == \'\'\n    k,v = line.strip.split \'=\', 2\n    known[k] = v\nend\nFile.readlines(path).each do |fileline| # <b>(4)</b>\n    prot,user,pass,host = fileline.scan(/^(.*?):\/\/(.*?):(.*?)@(.*)$/).first\n\n    if prot == known[\'protocol\'] and host == known[\'host\'] and user == known[\'username\'] then\n        puts "protocol=#{prot}"\n        puts "host=#{host}"\n        puts "username=#{user}"\n        puts "password=#{pass}"\n        exit(0)\n    end\nend</i>\n\nHere we parse the command-line options, allowing the user to specify the input file.\nThe default is <i>~/.git-credentials</i>.\nThis program only responds if the action is <i>get</i> and the backing-store file exists.\nThis loop reads from stdin until the first blank line is reached.\n\nThe inputs are stored in the <i>known</i> hash for later reference.\nThis loop reads the contents of the storage file, looking for matches.\nIf the protocol, host, and username from <i>known</i> match this line, the program prints the results to stdout and exits.\nWe’ll save our helper as <i>git-credential-read-only</i>, put it somewhere in our <i>PATH</i> and mark it executable.\n\nHere’s what an interactive session looks like:\n<i>$ git credential-read-only --file=/mnt/shared/creds get\nprotocol=https\nhost=mygithost\nusername=bob\nprotocol=https\nhost=mygithost\nusername=bob\npassword=s3cre7</i>\n\nSince its name starts with “git-”, we can use the simple syntax for the configuration value:\n<i>$ git config --global credential.helper \'read-only --file /mnt/shared/creds\'</i>\nAs you can see, extending this system is pretty straightforward, and can solve some common problems for you and your team.\n\n',

'<h2>Use Multiple GitHub Accounts With One Computer</h2><h3>How to set up and change SSH keys to use multiple GitHub accounts on one machine</h3>I currently have two GitHub accounts: a personal and a work one.\nObviously, my work computer is set up with my work account.\n\nI wanted to figure out how to push to GitHub with my personal account whenever I’m working on side projects via my work computer.\nAt first glance, for the seemingly simple task of switching between two accounts, the process seemed a little involved.\n\nBut once you break things down into steps, it’s less daunting.<h3>Quick Note on <em>SSH</em></h3><a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/#strong-authentication-with-ssh-keys">SSH</a>(or secure shell) is a network protocol which, among <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/#typical-uses-of-the-ssh-protocol">other things</a>, allows one computer to communicate with another over an unsecured network like the internet.\nWithout encryption, data travels over the web in plain text form.\nConsequently, it would be easy for someone to intercept valuable data, like user names or passwords, for wicked intent.SSH allows encryption of your data by way of a <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/"><em>tunnel</em></a>, which permits your computer to securely connect to another.\nThis is done via the use of <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/key/">SSH keys</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography </a>(aka asymmetric cryptography) which are used for authentication purposes between said computers, in order to decrypt the information being shared.\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc">Here’s a great video</a> explaining the concept of asymmetric cryptography further.SSH is commonly implemented using the client-server model.\n<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*On6fpv0NVHnmqZs7Dn6DqQ.png">\nClient-server model with asymmetric cryptography\nWhen running any remote commands from our computer(e.g., git push or git pull) to a remote repository (GitHub), it’s this protocol that enables us to do so without having to supply a password and username each time.\nLet’s now look at the configuration for it.<h3>Configuration</h3>The configuration can essentially be broken down into four steps:\nGenerate an SSH key for the new account.\nAttach this new key to your GitHub account.\nRegister the new key with the SSH agent.\nCreate an SSH config file.\n<h3>Step 1. Generate an <em>SSH</em> key for the new account</h3>Using the SSH protocol, we’ll have to generate a key for any new account we’d like to use.\nHop onto your terminal, run the following command, and attach your GitHub email address:$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "uremail@gmail.com" A new key pair will be generated.\nAt this point, you want to be careful not to overwrite your existing key pair, which would look like the following:({your home Directory}/.ssh/id_rsa):Instead, you can copy the directory and modify the file name to include your account name, as in the screenshot below:\n<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*tKXjK-bNH8wwkKOFJT_6tg.png">\nYou will then be prompted to enter a passphrase.\nYour new SSH key will be found at a directory similar to this:{your home Directory}/.ssh/id_rsa_uraccount<h3>Step 2. Attach the new key to your GitHub account</h3>We’ve just created a public key, and now we need to allow our GitHub account to trust it.\nThis allows you to not have to authenticate every time you run a remote command (git push, git pull).\nCopy the public key via the following command <i>pbcopy &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</i> and then log in to your personal GitHub account:\nGo to <i>Settings</i>.\nFrom the left side navigation, click <i>SSH and GPG keys</i>.\nClick on <i>New SSH key</i>, name it (it\'s a good idea to name it after the computer you’re using it in), and paste the key you previously copied.\nClick <i>Add key</i>.\n<h3>Step 3. Register the new key with the <em>SSH agent</em></h3>We now need to register our key with the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent">SSH agent</a>.\n\nThe SSH agent keeps track of user identity keys and passphrases and works as an additional layer of security.\nIn your terminal, write the command <i>ssh-add</i> and add the path to the files containing your keys.\nAs shown below, we are adding keys for our main account and the second account we just created.ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsassh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_uraccount<h3>Step 4. Create an <em>SSH</em> config file</h3>The SSH config file allows us to set configuration rules that will specify when we want to push to our work account versus our personal account.\n\nThis is done by defining which identity file to use ( the ones we’ve added to our SSH agent ) on which domain.\nIf the file has already been created, it should be at <i>~/.ssh/config</i>.\nBut by default, it will not exist, so we’ll need to create it by running the command <i>touch ~/.ssh/config</i>.\nYou can use any text editor or IDE to open and edit the file.\nI went with the terminal’s text editor <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a><strong>.\n\n</strong>I don’t use it frequently, and it does have a bit of a learning curve, so I tend to use a <a href="https://devhints.io/vim">cheat sheet</a> to navigate through it<strong>.\n</strong>To open the file, use <i>vim config</i>.# Account 1 (work or personal) - the default configHost github.com   HostName github.com   User git   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa   # Account 2 (work or personal) - the config we are addingHost github-uraccount      HostName github.com   User git   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_uraccountThe top part is the default configuration.\nIt comprises the following:<ul><li>the<strong> host</strong>(<i>github.com</i>)\nIts <strong>host name </strong>(<i>github.com</i>)\na <strong>user ID </strong>(<i>git</i>)\nits<strong> identity file</strong> (<i>~/.ssh/id_rsa</i>)</li></ul>We can basically duplicate the default configuration; we’ll only need to changes two things: the host (<i>github-uraccount</i>) and the identity file (to the key we created earlier, <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa_uraccount</i>).\nAnd that should do it.\nSave and close the file using <i>:wq</i> (if you are using vim).<h3>Create a new repository</h3>Now that we’re done with the configuration, let’s push to GitHub with our new account.\nIn your project’s working directory, start by initializing git using <i>git init </i>then go to GitHub and create a new repository.\nWhen you get to the instructions under Existing Git Repo, you’d normally just copy and paste the commands to your terminal to add the repo as the remote to your local repo, but for this case, we need to replace “github.com” with the host we set up in our config file earlier.\n\nSo instead of the default host <i>git@github.com</i>, we use <i>git@github-uraccount</i>.git remote add origin git@github-uraccount:uraccount/repo_name.gitNow you can push to GitHub using, for example, the following:git add .git commit -m "Initial commit"git push -u origin master<h3>Associate your commits with a particular username</h3>For a single repository, if you’d like to change the name associated with your commits, you’ll also need to change your user name and email to reflect the GitHub account you want the repository to be associated with by using <i><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git">git config</a></i> as shown below (to do it globally, add the flag <i>-g</i> before <i>user</i>).git config user.name "uraccount"git config user.email "uraccount@gmail.com"\n\n',

'<h2>Deep dive into Codespaces</h2>Understand how Codespaces works.\nCodespaces is an instant, cloud-based development environment that uses a container to provide you with common languages, tools, and utilities for development.\n\nCodespaces is also configurable, allowing you to create a customized development environment for your project.\nBy configuring a custom development environment for your project, you can have a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.<h3>Creating your codespace</h3>There are a number of entry points to create a codespace.\nFrom your repository for new feature work.\nFrom an open pull request to explore work-in-progress.\n\nFrom a commit in the repository\'s history to investigate a bug at a specific point in time.\nFrom Visual Studio Code.\nYour codespace can be ephemeral if you need to test something or you can return to the same codespace to work on long-running feature work.\n\nFor more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace">Creating a codespace</a>."\nOnce you\'ve selected the option to create a new codespace, some steps happen in the background before the codespace is available to you.\n<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-155258/images/help/codespaces/new-codespace-button.png" >\n<h3>Step 1: VM and storage are assigned to your codespace</h3>When you create a codespace, a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/">shallow clone</a> of your repository is made on a Linux virtual machine that is both dedicated and private to you.\nHaving a dedicated VM ensures that you have the entire set of compute resources from that machine available to you.\nIf necessary, this also allows you to have full root access to your container.<h3>Step 2: Container is created</h3>Codespaces uses a container as the development environment.\n\nThis container is created based on the configurations that you can define in a <i>devcontainer.json</i> file and/or Dockerfile in your repository.\nIf you don\'t <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project">configure a container</a>, Codespaces uses a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project#using-the-default-configuration">default image</a>, which has many languages and runtimes available.\nFor information on what the default image contains, see the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/codespaces-linux"><i>vscode-dev-containers</i></a> repository.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> If you want to use Git hooks in your codespace and apply anything in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init#_template_directory">git template directory</a> to your codespace, then you must set up hooks during step 4 after the container is created.\nSince your repository is cloned onto the host VM before the container is created, anything in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init#_template_directory">git template directory</a> will not apply in your codespace unless you set up hooks in your <i>devcontainer.json</i> configuration file using the <i>postCreateCommand</i> in step 4.\nFor more information, see "<a href="#step-4-post-creation-setup">Step 4: Post-creation setup</a>."\n<h3>Step 3: Connecting to the codespace</h3>When your container has been created and any other initialization has run, you\'ll be connected to your codespace.\nYou can connect to it through the web or via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</a>, or both, if needed.\n<h3>Step 4: Post-creation setup</h3>Once you are connected to your codespace, your automated setup may continue to build based on the configuration you specified in your <i>devcontainer.json</i> file.\nYou may see <i>postCreateCommand</i> and <i>postAttachCommand</i> run.\n\nIf you want to use Git hooks in your codespace,  set up hooks using the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference#_lifecycle-scripts"><i>devcontainer.json</i> lifecycle scripts</a>, such as <i>postCreateCommand</i>.\nFor more information, see the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference#_devcontainerjson-properties"><i>devcontainer.json</i> reference</a> in the Visual Studio Code documentation.\nIf you have a public dotfiles repository for Codespaces, you can enable it for use with new codespaces.\n\nWhen enabled, your dotfiles will be cloned to the container and the install script will be invoked.\nFor more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles">Personalizing Codespaces for your account</a>."\nFinally, the entire history of the repository is copied down with a full clone.\n\nDuring post-creation setup you\'ll still be able to use the integrated terminal and make edits to your files, but take care to avoid any race conditions between your work and the commands that are running.<h3>Codespaces lifecycle</h3><h3>Saving files in your codespace</h3>As you develop in your codespace, it will save any changes to your files every few seconds.\nYour codespace will keep running for 30 minutes after the last activity.\nAfter that time it will stop running but you can restart it from either from the existing browser tab or the list of existing codespaces.\n\nFile changes from the editor and terminal output are counted as activity and so your codespace will not stop if terminal output is continuing.\n<strong>Note:</strong> Changes in a codespace in Visual Studio Code are not saved automatically, unless you have enabled <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save">Auto Save</a>.<h3>Closing or stopping your codespace</h3>To stop your codespace you can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/codespaces-reference/using-the-vs-code-command-palette-in-codespaces#suspending-or-stopping-a-codespace">use the VS Code Command Palette</a> (<i>Shift + Command + P</i> (Mac) / <i>Ctrl + Shift + P</i> (Windows)).\nIf you exit your codespace without running the stop command (for example, closing the browser tab), or if you leave the codespace running without interaction, the codespace and its running processes will continue until a window of inactivity occurs, after which the codespace will stop.\nBy default, the window of inactivity is 30 minutes.\n\nWhen you close or stop your codespace, all uncommitted changes are preserved until you connect to the codespace again.<h3>Running your application</h3>Port forwarding gives you access to TCP ports running within your codespace.\n\nFor example, if you\'re running a web application on port 4000 within your codespace, you can automatically forward that port to make the application accessible from your browser.\nPort forwarding determines which ports are made accessible to you from the remote machine.\nEven if you do not forward a port, that port is still accessible to other processes running inside the codespace itself.\n\n<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-55542/images/help/codespaces/port-forwarding.png" >\nWhen an application running inside Codespaces outputs a port to the console, Codespaces detects the localhost URL pattern and automatically forwards the port.\nYou can click on the URL in the terminal or in the toast message to open the port in a browser.\n\nBy default, Codespaces forwards the port using HTTP.\nFor more information on port forwarding, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace">Forwarding ports in your codespace</a>."\nWhile ports can be forwarded automatically, they are not publicly accessible to the internet.\n\nBy default, all ports are private, but you can manually make a port available to your organization or public, and then share access through a URL.\nFor more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#sharing-a-port">Sharing a port</a>."\nRunning your application when you first land in your codespace can make for a fast inner dev loop.\n\nAs you edit, your changes are automatically saved and available on your forwarded port.\nTo view changes, go back to the running application tab in your browser and refresh it.<h3>Committing and pushing your changes</h3>Git is available by default in your codespace and so you can rely on your existing Git workflow.\nYou can work with Git in your codespace either via the Terminal or by using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol">Visual Studio Code</a>\'s source control UI.\nFor more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-source-control-in-your-codespace">Using source control in your codespace</a>"\n\n<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-76209/images/help/codespaces/git-status.png" >\nYou can create a codespace from any branch, commit, or pull request in your project, or you can switch to a new or existing branch from within your active codespace.\nBecause Codespaces is designed to be ephemeral, you can use it as an isolated environment to experiment, check a teammate\'s pull request, or fix merge conflicts.\n\nYou can create more than one codespace per repository or even per branch.\nHowever, each user account has a limit of 10 codespaces.\nIf you\'ve reached the limit and want to create a new codespace, you must delete a codespace first.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> Commits from your codespace will be attributed to the name and public email configured at <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">https://github.com/settings/profile</a>.\nA token scoped to the repository, included in the environment as <i>GITHUB_TOKEN</i>, and your GitHub credentials will be used to authenticate.<h3>Personalizing your codespace with extensions</h3>Using Visual Studio Code in your codespace gives you access to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace so that you can add any extensions you need.\nFor information on how extensions run in Codespaces, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions">Supporting Remote Development and GitHub Codespaces</a> in the Visual Studio Code docs.\nIf you already use Visual Studio Code, you can use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">Settings Sync</a> to automatically sync extensions, settings, themes, and keyboard shortcuts between your local instance and any Codespaces you create.\n',

'<h3>create a new repository</h3>create a new directory, open it and perform a\n<i>git init</i>\nto create a new git repository.',
'<h3>checkout a repository</h3>create a working copy of a local repository by running the command\n<i>git clone /path/to/repository</i>\nwhen using a remote server, your command will be\n<i>git clone username@host:/path/to/repository</i>',
'<h3>workflow</h3>your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git.\nthe first one is your <i>Working Directory</i> which holds the actual files.\nthe second one is the <i>Index</i> which acts as a staging area and\nfinally the <i>HEAD</i> which points to the last commit you\'ve made.\n<img src="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/img/trees.png">',
'<h3>add &amp; commit</h3>You can propose changes (add it to the <b>Index</b>) using\n<i>git add &lt;filename&gt;</i>\n<i>git add *</i>\nThis is the first step in the basic git workflow.

'<h3>pushing changes</h3>Your changes are now in the <b>HEAD</b> of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute\n<i>git push origin master</i>\nChange <i>master</i> to whatever branch you want to push your changes to.\nIf you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with\n<i>git remote add origin &lt;server&gt;</i>\nNow you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server',
'<h3>branching</h3>Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The <i>master</i> branch is the "default" branch when you create a repository.

Bash is an application that provides Git command line experience on the Operating System.\nIt is a command-line shell for enabling git with the command line in the system.\nA shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands.\nGit Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.\nIn Git Bash the user interacts with the repository and git elements through the commands.<h4 id="GitBashtopic-1"> What is Git?</h4>\n<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-lets-get-into-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Git</a> is version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.\nIt is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.\nIts goal is to increase efficiency, speed and easily manage large projects through version controlling.\nEvery git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.\nGit helps the team cope up with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-2"> Installing Git Bash</h4>\nFollow the steps given below to install Git Bash on Windows:\nStep 1: The .exe file installer for Git Bash can be downloaded from <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>\nOnce downloaded execute that installer, following window will occur:-\n\n<img

that you need to install and click on the Next button.\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200420212305/git-1.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1675417">\n\n\n\nStep 3: Select how to use the Git from command-line and click on Next to begin the installation process.\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200420212300/git22.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1675413">\n\nStep 4: Let the installation process finish to begin using Git Bash.\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200420212254/git3.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1675411">\nTo open Git Bash navigate to the folder where you have installed the git otherwise just simply search in your OS for git bash.\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421160427/Screenshot-2920.png" alt="" width="803" height="765" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678357"><h3 id="GitBashtopic-3"><span class="orange">Navigate in Git Bash</span></h3><h4 id="GitBashtopic-4"> cd command</h4>\ncd command refers to change directory and is used to get into the desired directory.To navigate between the folders the cd command is used\nSyntax:\ncd folder_name\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-5"> ls command</h4>\nls command is used to list all the files and folders in the current directory.\nSyntax:\nls\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-6"> Set your global username/email configuration</h4>\nOpen Git Bash and begin creating a username and email for working on Git Bash.Set your username:\ngit config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"\nSet your email address:\ngit config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-7"> Initializing a Local repository</h4>\nFollow the steps given below to initialize your Local Repository with Git:\nStep 1: Make a repository on <a href="www.github.com">Github</a>\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421144627/git-4.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1677989">\n\nStep 2: Give a suitable name of your repository and create the repository\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421145045/git5.jpg" alt="" width="932" height="838" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678005">\nNote: You can choose to initialize your git repository with a README file, and further, you can mention your project details in it.\nIt helps people know what this repository is about.\nHowever, it’s absolutely not necessary.\nBut if you do initialize your repo with a README file using interface provided by GitHub, then your local repository won’t have this README file.\nSo to avoid running into a snag while trying to push your files (as in step 3 of next section), after step 5 (where you initialize your local folder as your git repository), do following to pull that file to your local folder:\ngit pull <repository_url>\n\nStep 3: The following will appear after creating the repository\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421145943/git6.jpg" alt="" width="1320" height="798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678043">\n\nStep 4: Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to your local project by use of cd command.\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421151907/git-7.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678146">\n\nStep 5: Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.\n git init\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421152107/git-8.jpg" alt="" width="745" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678156">\n\nStep 6: Stage the files for the first commit by adding them to the local repository\ngit add .\n\nStep 7: By “git status” you can see the staged files\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421152939/git9.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="448" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678200">\n\nStep 8: Commit the files that you’ve staged in your local repository.\ngit commit -m "First commit"\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421153825/git10.jpg" alt="" width="745" height="451" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678232">\nNow After “git status” command it can be seen that nothing to commit is left, Hence all files have been committed.<h4 id="GitBashtopic-8"> Push files to your Git repository</h4>\n\nStep 1: Go to Github repository and in code section copy the URL.\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421154837/git11.jpg" alt="" width="1253" height="594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678273">\n\nStep 2: In the Command prompt, add the URL for your repository where your local repository will be pushed.\ngit remote add origin repository_URL\n\nStep 3: Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.\ngit push origin master\nHere the files have been pushed to the master branch of your repository.\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421155539/git12.png" alt="" width="742" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678303">\n\nNow in the GitHub repository, the pushed files can be seen.\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421155736/git13.png" alt="" width="1284" height="593" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678317">\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-9"> Saving changes to local repository</h4>\nSuppose the files are being changed and new files are added to local repository.\nTo save the changes in the git repository:\n\nStep 1: Changes have to be staged for the commit.\ngit add .\nor\ngit add file_name\n\nStep 2: Now commit the staged files.\ngit commit -m "commit_name"\n\nStep 3: Push the changes.\ngit push origin master\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421165540/git-14.png" alt="" width="743" height="451" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678619">\nNew changes can be

id="GitBashtopic-10"><span class="orange">Branching through Git Bash</span></h3><h4 id="GitBashtopic-11"> Branching in Github</h4>\nSuppose if a team is working on a project and a branch is created for every member working on the project.\nHence every member will work on their branches hence every time the best branch is merged to the master branch of the project.\nThe branches make it version controlling system and makes it very easy to maintain a project source code.Syntax:List all of the branches in your repository.\ngit branch\n\nCreate a new branch\ngit branch branch_name\n\nSafe Delete the specified branch\ngit branch -d branch_name\n\nForce delete the specified branch\ngit branch -D branch_name\n\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-12"> Navigating between Branches</h4>\nTo navigate between the branches git checkout is used.To create create a new branch and switch on it:\ngit checkout -b new_branch_name\nTo simply switch to a branch\ngit checkout branch_name\nAfter checkout to branch you can see a * on the current branch\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200421182445/git-17.png" alt="" width="748" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full

commit --amend\n<h4 id="GitBashtopic-16"> Conclusion</h4>\nTo conclude it can be said that git bash is a command line platform which helps in enabling git and its elements in your system.\nThere are a bunch of commands which are used in git bash.\nGit Bash is very easy to use and makes it easy to work on repositories and projects.\n<h3 id="GitBashtopic-17">What is Git Bash?</h3>Before you look at what Git Bash is, let\'s go over what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Git</a> is.\nGit is a version control system for controlling changes in software development.\nLike macOS and Linux, operating systems already have a command-line terminal where you can run Git and Linux commands directly.\nBut for Windows, you have the Windows command prompt, which is a non-Unix terminal.\nHow can you run Git and Linux commands in Windows? Git Bash will do the trick.\nGit Bash is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emulator</a> that provides an emulation layer for Git to run Linux commands on Windows PCs.\nAn emulator enables one specific system to behave like another computer system.<h3 id="GitBashtopic-18">Downloading and Installing Git (Bash)</h3>Now that you know a little about Git Bash let\'s see how you can download and install it.\nThere are three different ways of downloading the Git software for Windows OS, as shown below.\nThrough <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Git\'s official website</a>\nThrough a separate project on GitHub called <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Git for Windows.</a>\nThrough a software package manager like <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chocolatey</a>\n\nDownload Git with any of the three ways you prefer, but this tutorial will use the official website.\nAfter downloading Git, let\'s start installing it on your Windows PC.\n1. Launch the installer you downloaded and click <strong>Next</strong> through the steps until you get to the <strong>Select Components</strong> screen.\n2. Now, check the boxes of additional components you want to include in the installation.\nLeave the ones selected by default, as shown below, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160017.819.png">\n Selecting Additional Components To Install\n\n3. Leave the default for creating a shortcut in the start menu folder, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160058.642.png">\n Selecting Start menu folder name\n\n4. Select <strong>Use Notepad as Git\'s default editor</strong> from the drop-down list as a default editor to use with Git, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\nNow Git files like <em><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-config" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">~./gitconfig</a></em> will open in Notepad by default.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160129.657.png">\n Selecting Git\'s Default Editor\n5. Select the <strong>Override the default branch name for new repositories</strong> option as the default branch name (<strong>main</strong>) for Git to use.\nWhen you initialize a Git repository, Git will use this branch name by default.\n\nThe default branch name used to be “master” for Git repositories.\nBut many people found “master” an offensive word.\nSo GitHub followed the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Software Freedom Conservancy\'s</a> suggestion and provided an option to override the default branch name when initializing a Git repository.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160213.065.png">\n Selecting Default Branch Name\n\n6. Now, select <strong>Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software</strong> option so that Git command can be executed from different tools.\nSome of those tools are Command Prompt, PowerShell or any other 3rd party software tools, along with the Git Bash console.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160304.183.png">\n Selecting a Console Where Git Commands Can Run\n\n7. Select the <strong>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenSSL</a> library</strong> option to let Git validate certificates with OpenSSL, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\nOpenSSL is a cryptographic library that contains open-source implementation of SSL and TLS protocols.\n\nIf you are using Git in an organization with enterprise-managed certificates, select the <strong>User the native Windows Secure Channel library</strong> option instead.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160352.415.png">\n Selecting SSL/TLS library for HTTPS connections\n\n8. Leave the default <strong>Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings</strong> option selected, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\n\nIf you configure “Windows-style” line ending conversions, when you hit return on your keyboard after executing a Git command, Git will insert an invisible character called <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#about-line-endings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line ending</a>.\nWhen different contributors make changes from different operating systems, Git might produce unexpected results.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160446.764.png">\n Selecting line endings option\n\n9. Select the <strong>Use Mintty (the default terminal of MSYS2)</strong> option as the default terminal emulator to run commands, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\nMintty is the default terminal of <a href="https://www.msys2.org/wiki/MSYS2-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MSYS2</a>.\nMSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries that provides a Unix-like environment for software distribution and a building platform for Windows.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160521.451.png">\n Selecting a default terminal emulator\n10. Select the <strong>Default (fast-forward or merge)</strong> option below as <i><a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">git pull</a></i> command\'s default behavior.\nThe <i>git pull</i> command is the shorthand for <i><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">git fetch</a></i> and <i><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">git merge</a></i>, which fetches and incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.\n\nPerhaps you want to merge a new branch to the master.\nIf so, Git would directly merge using fast-forward without going through <i>git fetch</i> and <i>git merge</i> commands.\nThe merge is only possible if there are no commits on master from when you\'ve created the new branch.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160617.398.png">\n Selecting Default Behavior for <i>git pull</i> Command\n\n11. Select the <strong>Git Credential Manager Core</strong> as the default <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Git credential helper</a>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\nGit credential helpers are external programs that Git can prompt for input data, like usernames and passwords.\nThese input data can be stored in memory for a limited time or stored on the disk.\n\nGit Credential Manager Core is based on the .NET framework and will provide multi-factor HTTPS authentication with Git.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T160805.216.png">\n Selecting Default Credential Manager\n\n12. Leave the extra features on default, as shown below, and click <strong>Next</strong>.\nThe <strong>Enable file system caching</strong> option is checked to provide quick results when executing Git commands.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T161004.649.png">\n Enabling extra options\n\n13. Ensure to leave both options below at default (<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/pseudoconsoles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pseudo console</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/discussions/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in file system monitor</a></strong>) as they are still in an experimental stage, and click <strong>Install</strong>.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T161045.192.png">\n Experimental options support\n\n14. Complete the installation and close the installation wizard by clicking on <strong>Finish</strong>.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-2021-08-31T161121.891.png">\n Git setup wizard complete screen\n\n15. Finally, right-click on your desktop and select <strong>Git Bash Here</strong> from the context menu, as shown below, to launch Git Bash terminal.\nLaunching Git Bash from your desktop is one of the quickest ways to do so, but the same process goes when you right-click on a folder.\n\n<img src="https://adamtheautomator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/version-1.png">\n Launching Git Bash from Desktop Context Menu\n\n16.

'<h2>git push --set-upstream origin branch</h2>If you do not have upstream for the current branch, Git changes its behavior on <i>git push</i>, and on other commands as well.\n\nThe complete push story here is long and boring. \nTo shorten it a whole lot, <i>git push</i> was implemented poorly.<h3>What is an upstream?</h3>An <em>upstream</em> is simply another branch name, usually a remote-tracking branch, associated with a (regular, local) branch.\n\nEvery branch has the option of having one (1) upstream set. \nThat is, every branch either has an upstream, or does not have an upstream. \nNo branch can have more than one upstream.\n\nThe upstream <em>should</em>, but does not have to be, a valid branch (whether remote-tracking like <i>origin/<em>B</em></i> or local like <i>master</i>). \nThat is, if the current branch <em>B</em> has upstream <em>U</em>, <i>git rev-parse <em>U</em></i> <em>should</em> work. \nIf it does not work—if it complains that <em>U</em> does not exist—then most of Git acts as though the upstream is not set at all. \nA few commands, like <i>git branch -vv</i>, will show the upstream setting but mark it as "gone".\n<h3>What good is an upstream?</h3>If your <i>push.default</i> is set to <i>simple</i> or <i>upstream</i>, the upstream setting will make <i>git push</i>, used with no additional arguments, just work.\n\nThat\'s it—that\'s all it does for <i>git push</i>. \nBut that\'s fairly significant, since <i>git push</i> is one of the places where a simple typo causes major headaches.\n\nIf your <i>push.default</i> is set to <i>nothing</i>, <i>matching</i>, or <i>current</i>, setting an upstream does nothing at all for <i>git push</i>.\n\n(All of this assumes your Git version is at least 2.0.)\n<h3>The upstream affects <i>git fetch</i></h3>\nIf you run <i>git fetch</i> with no additional arguments, Git figures out <em>which</em> remote to fetch from by consulting the current branch\'s upstream. \nIf the upstream is a remote-tracking branch, Git fetches from that remote. \n(If the upstream is not set or is a local branch, Git tries fetching <i>origin</i>.)\n<h3>The upstream affects <i>git merge</i> and <i>git rebase</i> too</h3>\nIf you run <i>git merge</i> or <i>git rebase</i> with no additional arguments, Git uses the current branch\'s upstream. \nSo it shortens the use of these two commands.\n<h3>The upstream affects <i>git pull</i></h3>\nYou should never\n2. use <i>git pull</i> anyway, but if you do, <i>git pull</i> uses the upstream setting to figure out which remote to fetch from, and then which branch to merge or rebase with. \nThat is, <i>git pull</i> does the same thing as <i>git fetch</i>—because it actually <em>runs</em> <i>git fetch</i>—and then does the same thing as <i>git merge</i> or <i>git rebase</i>, because it actually <em>runs</em> <i>git merge</i> or <i>git rebase</i>.\n\n(You should usually just do these two steps manually, at least until you know Git well enough that when either step fails, which they will eventually, you recognize what went wrong and know what to do about it.)\n<h3>The upstream affects <i>git status</i></h3>\nThis may actually be the most important. \nOnce you have an upstream set, <i>git status</i> can report the difference between your current branch and its upstream, in terms of commits.\n\nIf, as is the normal case, you are on branch <em><i>B</i></em> with its upstream set to <i>origin/<em>B</em></i>, and you run <i>git status</i>, you will immediately see whether you have commits you can push, and/or commits you can merge or rebase onto.\n\nThis is because <i>git status</i> runs:\n\n<i>git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD</i>: how many commits do you have on <em><i>B</i></em> that are not on <i>origin/<em>B</em></i>?\n\n<i>git rev-list --count HEAD..@{u}</i>: how many commits do you have on <i>origin/<em>B</em></i> that are not on <em><i>B</i></em>?\n\nSetting an upstream gives you all of these things.\n<h3>How come <i>master</i> already has an upstream set?</h3>\nWhen you first clone from some remote, using:\n\n<i>$ git clone git://some.host/path/to/repo.git</i>\n\nor similar, the last step Git does is, essentially, <i>git checkout master</i>. \nThis checks out your local branch <i>master</i>—only you don\'t <em>have</em> a local branch <i>master</i>.\n\nOn the other hand, you <em>do</em> have a remote-tracking branch named <i>origin/master</i>, because you just cloned it.\n\nGit guesses that you must have meant: "make me a new local <i>master</i> that points to the same commit as remote-tracking <i>origin/master</i>, and, while you\'re at it, set the upstream for <i>master</i> to <i>origin/master</i>."\n\nThis happens for <em>every</em> branch you <i>git checkout</i> that you do not already have. \nGit creates the branch <em>and</em> makes it "track" (have as an upstream) the corresponding remote-tracking branch.\n<h3>But this doesn\'t work for <em>new</em> branches, i.e., branches with no remote-tracking branch <em>yet</em>.</h3>\nIf you create a <em>new</em> branch:\n\n<i>$ git checkout -b solaris</i>\n\nthere is, as yet, no <i>origin/solaris</i>. \nYour local <i>solaris</i> <em>cannot</em> track remote-tracking branch <i>origin/solaris</i> because it does not exist.\n\nWhen you first push the new branch:\n\n<i>$ git push origin solaris</i>\n\nthat <em>creates</em> <i>solaris</i> on <i>origin</i>, and hence also creates <i>origin/solaris</i> in your own Git repository. \nBut it\'s too late: you already have a local <i>solaris</i> that <em>has no upstream</em>.\n\n3.<h3>Shouldn\'t Git just set that, now, as the upstream automatically?</h3>\nProbably. \nSee "implemented poorly" and footnote 1. \nIt\'s hard to change <em>now</em>: There are millions\n\n4. of scripts that use Git and some may well depend on its current behavior. \nChanging the behavior requires a new major release, nag-ware to force you to set some configuration field, and so on. \nIn short, Git is a victim of its own success: whatever mistakes it has in it, today, can only be fixed if the change is either mostly invisible, clearly-much-better, or done slowly over time.\n\nThe fact is, it doesn\'t today, <em>unless</em> you use <i>--set-upstream</i> or <i>-u</i> during the <i>git push</i>. \nThat\'s what the message is telling you.\n\nYou don\'t have to do it like that. \nWell, as we noted above, you don\'t have to do it at all, but let\'s say you <em>want</em> an upstream. \nYou have already created branch <i>solaris</i> on <i>origin</i>, through an earlier push, and as your <i>git branch</i> output shows, you already <em>have</em> <i>origin/solaris</i> in your local repository.\n\nYou just don\'t have it set as the upstream for <i>solaris</i>.\n\nTo set it now, rather than during the first push, use <i>git branch --set-upstream-to</i>. \nThe <i>--set-upstream-to</i> sub-command takes the name of any existing branch, such as <i>origin/solaris</i>, and sets the current branch\'s upstream to that other branch.\n\nThat\'s it—that\'s all it does—but it has all those implications noted above. \nIt means you can just run <i>git fetch</i>, then look around, then run <i>git merge</i> or <i>git rebase</i> as appropriate, then make new commits and run <i>git push</i>, without a bunch of additional fussing-around.\n\n1.To be fair, it was not clear back then that the initial implementation was error-prone. \nThat only became clear when every new user made the same mistakes every time. \nIt\'s now "less poor", which is not to say "great".\n\n2."Never" is a bit strong, but I find that Git newbies understand things a lot better when I separate out the steps, especially when I can show them what <i>git fetch</i> actually did, and they can then see what <i>git merge</i> or <i>git rebase</i> will do next.\n\n3.If you run your <em>first</em> <i>git push</i> as <i>git push -u origin solaris</i>—i.e., if you add the <i>-u</i> flag—Git will set <i>origin/solaris</i> as the upstream for your current branch if (and only if) the push succeeds. \nSo you should supply <i>-u</i> on the <em>first</em> push. \nIn fact, you can supply it on any later push, and it will set <em>or change</em> the upstream at that point. \nBut I think <i>git branch --set-upstream-to</i> is easier, if you forgot.\n\n4.Measured by the Austin Powers / Dr Evil method of simply saying "one MILLLL-YUN", anyway.\n',
'<h2>Push to github without typing user name / password</h2><h3>1. Using SSH</h3>If you need to do a push without username and password prompt, but you are always prompted, then your origin remote is pointing at the https url rather than the ssh url.\nA way to skip typing my username/password when using https://github, is by changing the HTTPs origin remote which pointing to an HTTP url into an SSH url.\n\nFor example,\nhttps url: https://github.com/&lt;Username&gt;/&lt;Project&gt;.git\nssh url: git@github.com:&lt;Username&gt;/&lt;Project&gt;.git\nYou can do:\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:&lt;Username&gt;/&lt;Project&gt;.git\nto change the url.\n\n<strong>Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH</strong>\nOpen Terminal (for Mac and Linux users) or the command prompt (for Windows).\nChange the current working directory to your local project.\nList your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.\ngit remote -v\n$ origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)\n$ origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)\nChange your remote’s URL from HTTPS to SSH with the git remote set-url command.\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git\nVerify that the remote URL has changed.\n\ngit remote -v\n$ Verify new remote URL\n$ origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git (fetch)\n$ origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git (push)\n<h3>2.

foo\ngit add -u\ngit commit -m "added content to foo"</i>\n\nNow I\'ll create a new file and stage it for committing, but I won\'t commit it (this is where we pretend my branch is in some hideously complex state).\n<h3 id="MultipleBranchestopic-5">Create new worktree branch</h3><i>git worktree add ../foo_hotfix</i>\n\nNote: you\'ll want to create the new worktree in a directory outside of your current repo\'s directory (just so there\'s a clear distinction).\n\nAt this point you\'ll find your current terminal is still in the same <i>foo_contents</i>, but there is now a new directory called <i>foo_hotfix</i> outside your current repo\'s directory.\n<h3 id="MultipleBranchestopic-6">Make changes in new worktree branch</h3>Open up a new terminal (or split window) and run through the following steps:\n\n<i>cd ./foo_hotfix</i> (or <i>cd ../foo_hotfix</i> if your new terminal is currently set to your main git repo directory)\n<i>git log</i>\n\nOK, so if you do a <i>git log</i> you\'ll find that the worktree has a branch automatically created and named after the worktree (so the branch is called <i>foo_hotfix</i> in my case).\n\nThe important thing to realize is that <i>git worktree add</i> is a bit like <i>git branch</i> in that it creates the new worktree from the current branch you\'re in.\nMeaning that my <i>foo_hotfix</i> branch has the "added content to foo" commit from the <i>foo_contents</i> branch as that\'s where I ran the <i>git worktree add</i> command from.\n\nThis is what <i>git log</i> looks like for me in this new worktree:\n\n<i>* d374dcb (Integralist) - (HEAD -&gt; foo_hotfix, foo_contents) added content to foo (2 minutes ago)\n* 9ae3a7f (Integralist) - (master) created foo file (3 minutes ago)</i>\n don\'t want the commit <i>d374dcb</i> in there as it\'s coming from a branch (<i>foo_contents</i>) that\'s still in progress, and so I\'ll need to rebase out that commit:\n\n<i>git rebase -i 9ae3a7f</i>\n\nNote: the rebase editor opens and I change <i>pick</i> to <i>drop</i> to get rid of the commit.\n\nNow at this point I have a new working directory that I can work in:\n\n<i>echo hotfix &gt; baz\ngit add baz\ngit commit -m "some hotfix"</i>\n<h3 id="MultipleBranchestopic-7">Merge my hotfix back into master</h3>I\'m going to change into my <i>master</i> branch, but remember I\'m still in the <i>foo_hotfix</i> directory, so my main repo directory <i>foo_project</i> (open in another terminal window) is still in the <i>foo_contents</i> branch).\n\n<i>git checkout master\ngit merge foo_hotfix</i>\n<h3 id="MultipleBranchestopic-8">Removing the worktree</h3>OK, so at this point we\'ve merged our hotfix into <i>master</i>.\nI want to go back to my original repo directory and make sure I have the latest <i>master</i> rebased in before continuing on with my <i>foo_contents</i> work.\n\nTo remove the worktree you can either remove it using the git interface (e.g.\n<i>git worktree remove foo_hotfix</i>) or manually remove it (e.g.\n<i>cd ../ &amp;&amp; rm ./foo_hotfix</i>), where git will, at some point in the future, internally run a prune and remove any references to this orphaned branch/working tree (you could also manually trigger that prune using <i>git worktree prune</i>).\n\nNote: if I do <i>git worktree remove foo_hotfix</i> while currently residing inside the <i>foo_hotfix</i> directory, I\'ll find that the <i>.git</i> repository is removed from the directory.\n<h3 id="MultipleBranchestopic-9">Continuing working on my feature branch</h3>Presuming I\'m still in the <i>foo_hotfix</i> directory and that\'s where I ran <i>git worktree remove foo_hotfix</i>:\n\n<i>cd ../foo_project\ngit rebase master</i> &lt;

I need to stash my changes first †\n<i>git stash pop</i>\n\n† why yes, this does seem a bit strange considering that\'s what I was trying to avoid in the first place, but in this case it\'s a single ‘stash\' and so a simple <i>git stash pop</i> will suffice to get me back to where I need to be.\n\nI can now continue working on my <i>foo_contents</i> branch.\n\n',

target="_self">Conclusion</a><br></div>\n\nWhen you do <i>git init</i>, you initialize a local Git repository.\nIn general, the purpose is to synchronize this repo with a remote Git repo.\n\nTo be able to synchronize code with a remote repo, you need to specify where the remote repo exists.\nThe first step is to add remote repos to your project.\n<i># Syntax to add a git remote\ngit remote add REMOTE-ID REMOTE-URL</i>\nBy convention, the original / primary remote repo is called <i>origin</i>.\nHere’s a real example:\n\n<i># Add remote 1: GitHub.\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git\n# Add remote 2: BitBucket.\ngit remote add upstream git@bitbucket.org:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git</i>\nIn the above example, we add the remote repository of a project called <a href="https://github.com/jigarius/toggl2redmine">Toggl 2 Redmine</a> found on GitHub.\nUse the above command to add one or more remote Git repos – make sure that each repo has its unique ID, i.e.\n<i>origin</i>, <i>upstream</i> in the above example.<h3 id="multiRemotestopic-1">Configure primary remote</h3>Though you can add multiple remotes, usually, each branch of your project can be configured to track a single remote branch.\nYou can setup a branch to track a remote branch as follows:\n<i># Change local branch.\ngit checkout BRANCH\n\n# Configure local branch to track a remote branch.\ngit branch -u origin/BRANCH</i>\nHere, <i>BRANCH</i> is the name of the remote branch, which is usually the same as your local branch.\n<h3 id="multiRemotestopic-2">Change remote URL</h3>If you want to change the URL associated to a remote that you’ve already added, you can do it with the following command:\n<i># The syntax is: git remote set-url REMOTE-ID REMOTE-URL\n\ngit remote set-url upstream git@foobar.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git</i><h3 id="multiRemotestopic-3">List all remotes</h3>To see a list of all remotes, simply use the following command:\n\n<i>$git remote -v\norigin	    git@github.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git (fetch)\norigin	    git@github.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git (push)\nupstream    git@bitbucket.org:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git (fetch)\nupstream    git@bitbucket.org:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git (push)</i><h3 id="multiRemotestopic-4">Remove a remote</h3>If you’ve added a remote which you no longer require, you can remove it as follows:\n<i># The syntax is: git remote remove REMOTE-ID\ngit remote remove upstream</i>\n<h3 id="multiRemotestopic-5">Push to multiple remotes</h3>Now that you have a primary remote repo and other remotes as well, it’s time to configure the push.\nThe objective is to <em>push to multiple Git remotes</em> with a single <i>git push</i> command.\n\nTo do this, choose a remote ID which will refer to all the remotes.\nI usually call it <i>all</i>, but there are developers who prefer <i>origin</i>.\nThe idea is to add all the remote repo URLs as  “push URLs” to this remote.\n\nHere’s what you do:\n<i># Create a new remote called "all" with the URL of the primary repo.\ngit remote add all git@github.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git\n\n# Re-register the remote as a push URL.\ngit remote set-url --add --push all git@github.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git\n# Add a push URL to a remote.\n\nThis means that "git push" will also push to this git URL.\ngit remote set-url --add --push all git@bitbucket.org:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git</i>\nIf you don’t want to create an extra remote named <i>all</i>, you can skip the first command and use the remote <i>origin</i> instead of <i>all</i> in the subsequent command(s).\n\nNow, you can push to all remote repositories with a single command!\n<i># Replace BRANCH with the name of the branch you want to push.\ngit push all BRANCH</i>\n<h3 id="multiRemotestopic-6">Pull from multiple remotes</h3>It is not possible to <i>git pull</i> from multiple repos.\nHowever, you can <i>git fetch</i> from multiple repos with the following command:\n\n<i>git fetch --all</i>\nThis will <em>fetch</em> information from all remote repos.\nYou can switch to the latest version of a branch on a particular remote with the command:\n\n<i># Checkout the branch you want to work with.\ngit checkout BRANCH\n# Reset the branch to match the state as on a specific remote.\n\ngit reset --hard REMOTE-ID/BRANCH</i><h3 id="multiRemotestopic-7">Conclusion</h3>It is easy to synchronize code between multiple git repositories, especially, pushing to multiple remotes.\n\nThis is helpful when you’re maintaining mirrors / copies of the same repository.\nAll you need to do is set up multiple push URLs on a remote and then perform <i>git push</i> to that remote as you usually do.\n\n',
'<h2>branch operations</h2><k>rename a branch while pointed to any branch</k>, do:\ngit branch -m oldname newname\n\n<k>rename the current branch</k>, you can do:\ngit branch -m newname\n\n<k>push the local branch</k> and reset the upstream branch:\ngit push origin -u newname\n\n<k>Delete the remote branch</k>:\ngit push origin --delete oldname\n\nA way to remember this is -m is for "move" (or mv), which is how you rename files.\n<k>Adding an alias</k> could also help.\n\nTo do so, run the following:\ngit config --global alias.rename \'branch -m\'\n\nIf you are on Windows or another case-insensitive filesystem, and there are only capitalization changes in the name, you need to use -M, otherwise, git will throw branch already exists error:\ngit branch -M newname\n\n<k>Switch to the branch</k> which needs to be renamed\ngit branch -m new_name\ngit push origin :old_name\ngit push origin new_name:refs/heads/new_name\n\n<k>delete a local branch</k> in Git\ngit branch -d local-branch\n\nTo delete a remote branch, you need to use the "git push" command:\ngit push origin --delete remote-branch-name\n\n\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:williamkpchanHP/newDoc.git\ngit add *.bat\ngit push --set-upstream origin master\n\ngit branch -d newDoc\ngit commit -m "update"\n\ngit remote -vgit remote add origin <url>git remote set-url origin <url>\n\ngit remote -v\n\ngit@github.com:williamkpchanHP/newDoc.git\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:williamkpchanHP/newDoc.git\ngit push -u origin main\n',

'<h2>git error "No such remote \'origin\'</h2>You haven\'t set up the remote repository\nYou then ran\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/williamkpchanHP/newDoc.git\n\nAfter that, your local repository should be able to communicate with the remote repository that resides at the specified URL (https://github.com/williamkpchanHP/newDoc.git)... provided that remote repo actually exists!\n\nBefore attempting to push to that remote repository, you need to make sure that the latter actually exists. So go to GitHub and create the remote repo in question. Then and only then will you be able to successfully push with\n\ngit push -u origin master\n',
'<h2>delete branches in Git</h2>Deleting <b>local branches</b>\nFirst, we print out all the branches (local as well as remote), using the git branch command with -a (all) flag.\n\nTo delete the local branch, just run the git branch command again, this time with the -d (delete) flag, followed by the name of the branch you want to delete (test branch in this case).\nNote: Comments are the output produced as a result of running these git commands\n\ngit branch -a\n# *master\n#  test\n#  remote/origin/master\n#  remote/origin/test\n\ngit branch -d test\n# Deleted branch test (was ########).\n\nNote: You can also use the -D flag which is synonymous with --delete --force instead of -d. This will delete the branch regardless of its merge status.',
'<b>Deleting remote branches</b>\nTo delete a remote branch, you can’t use the git branch command. Instead, use the git push command with --delete flag, followed by the name of the branch you want to delete. You also need to specify the remote name (origin in this case) after git push.\n\ngit branch -a\n# *master\n#  test\n#  remote/origin/master\n#  remote/origin/test\n\ngit push origin --delete test\n# To <URL of your repository>.git\n#  - [deleted]         test\n\nDelete this branch: remote/devs/JunitTest\ngit push devs --delete JunitTest\n',

'<h2>save username and password in Git</h2>Attention: This method saves the credentials in plaintext on your PC\'s disk. Everyone on your computer can access it, e.g. malicious NPM modules.\n\nYou can use the git config to enable credentials storage in Git.\nRun\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\nthen\ngit pull\n\nprovide a username and password and those details will then be remembered later.\nThe credentials are stored in a file on the disk, with the disk permissions of "just user readable/writable" but still in plaintext.\n\nWhen running this command,\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\nthe first time you pull or push from the remote repository, you\'ll get asked about the username and password.\n\nAfterwards, for consequent communications with the remote repository you don\'t have to provide the username and password.\n\nThe storage format is a .git-credentials file, stored in plaintext.\n\nAlso, you can use other helpers for the git config credential.helper, namely memory cache:\ngit config credential.helper \'cache --timeout=&lt;timeout>\'\n\nwhich takes an optional timeout parameter, determining for how long the credentials will be kept in memory.\nUsing the helper, the credentials will never touch the disk and will be erased after the specified timeout. The default value is 900 seconds (15 minutes).\n\nIf you want to change the password later\ngit pull\nWill fail, because the password is incorrect, git then removes the offending user+password from the ~/.git-credentials file, so now re-run\n\ngit pull\nto provide a new password so it works as earlier.\n',
'<h2>Git credential helper - update password</h2>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25845963/git-credential-helper-update-password\n\nTo update your credentials, go to Control Panel → Credential Manager → Generic Credentials.\nFind the credentials related to your Git account and edit them to use the updated password.\n\nNote that to use the Windows Credential Manager for Git you need to configure the credential helper like so:\n\ngit config --global credential.helper wincred\n\nIf you have multiple GitHub accounts that you use for different repositories, then you should configure credentials to use the full repository path (rather than just the domain, which is the default):\ngit config --global credential.useHttpPath true\n\n',

'<h2>Quickstart for Codespaces</h2>In this guide, you\'ll create a codespace from a <a href="https://github.com/2percentsilk/haikus-for-codespaces">template repository</a> and explore some of the essential features available to you within the codespace.\nFrom this quickstart, you will learn how to create a codespace, connect to a forwarded port to view your running application, use version control in a codespace, and personalize your setup with extensions.\n\nFor more information on exactly how Codespaces works, see the companion guide "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive">Deep dive into Codespaces</a>."<h3>Creating your codespace</h3>Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/2percentsilk/haikus-for-codespaces">template repository</a> and select <strong>Use this template</strong>.\n\nName your repository, select your preferred privacy setting, and click <strong>Create repository from this template</strong>.\nNavigate to the main page of the newly created repository.\nUnder the repository name, use the <strong> Code</strong> drop-down menu, and in the <strong>Codespaces</strong> tab, click  <strong>New codespace</strong>.\n<h3>Running the application</h3>Once your codespace is created, your repository will be automatically cloned into it.\nNow you can run the application and launch it in a browser.\n\nSince this example uses a Node.js project, start the application by entering <i>npm run dev</i> in the terminal.\nThis command executes the <i>dev</i> script in the package.json file and starts up the web application defined in the sample repository.\nIf you\'re following along with a different application type, enter the corresponding start command for that project.\n\nWhen your application starts, the codespace recognizes the port the application is running on and displays a prompt to forward that port so you can connect to it.\nClick <strong>Open in Browser</strong> to view your running application in a new tab.<h3>Edit the application and view changes</h3>\nSwitch back to your codespace and open the <i>haikus.json</i> file by double-clicking it in the File Explorer.\nEdit the <i>text</i> field of the first haiku to personalize the application with your own haiku.\nGo back to the running application tab in your browser and refresh to see your changes.\n\nIf you\'ve closed the tab, open the Ports panel and click the <strong>Open in browser</strong> icon for the running port.<h3>Committing and pushing your changes</h3>Now that you\'ve made a few changes, you can use the integrated terminal or the source view to commit and push the changes back to the remote.\n\nIn the Activity Bar, click the <strong>Source Control</strong> view.\nTo stage your changes, click  <strong>+</strong> next to the file you\'ve changed, or next to <strong>Changes</strong> if you\'ve changed multiple files and you want to stage them all.\nType a commit message describing the change you\'ve made.\n\nTo commit your staged changes, click the check mark at the top the source control side bar.\nYou can push the changes you\'ve made.\nThis applies those changes to the upstream branch on the remote repository.\n\nYou might want to do this if you\'re not yet ready to create a pull request, or if you prefer to create a pull request on GitHub.\nAt the top of the side bar, click the ellipsis (<strong>...</strong>).\nIn the drop-down menu, click <strong>Push</strong>.\n<h3>Personalizing with an extension</h3>Within a codespace, you have access to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.\nFor this example, you\'ll install an extension that alters the theme, but you can install any extension that is useful for your workflow.\n\nIn the left sidebar, click the Extensions icon.\nIn the search bar, enter <i>fairyfloss</i> and install the fairyfloss extension.\nSelect the <i>fairyfloss</i> theme by selecting it from the list.\n\nChanges you make to your editor setup in the current codespace, such as theme and keyboard bindings, are synced automatically via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">Settings Sync</a> to any other codespaces you open and any instances of Visual Studio Code that are signed into your GitHub account.<h3>Next Steps</h3>You\'ve successfully created, personalized, and run your first application within a codespace but there\'s so much more to explore! Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with Codespaces.\n\n<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive">Deep dive</a>: This quickstart presented some of the features of Codespaces.\nThe deep dive looks at these areas from a technical standpoint.\n<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started-with-codespaces">Setting up your project for Codespaces</a>: These guides provide information on setting up your project to use Codespaces with specific languages\n\n<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project">Configuring Codespaces for your project</a>: This guide provides details on creating a custom configuration for Codespaces for your project.<h3>Further reading</h3><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-codespaces-for-your-organization">Enabling Codespaces for your organization</a>\n',
