<h4 id="installmojomarketplace">How to Install WordPress using MOJO Marketplace</h4>
<p>MOJO Marketplace provides a simple WordPress installer tool. Several hosting companies use this to provide a 1-click WordPress install experience. This installer is integrated into their cPanel dashboard. </p>
<p>For this tutorial, we will be showing you the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bluehost" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/" data-shortcode="true">BlueHost</a> cPanel. Simply login to your hosting account and then on your cPanel dashboard scroll down to the website section. </p>
<p><img title="Install WordPress icon in Bluehost&#039;s cPanel dashboard" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1clickwordpressinstall.png" alt="Install WordPress icon in Bluehost&#039;s cPanel dashboard" width="520" height="209" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32282" /></p>
<p>Click on Install WordPress icon or 1-click Install. They will both take you to the MOJO Marketplace where you will see an overview about WordPress with a Install button. You need to click on the install button to continue. </p>
<p><img title="Begin WordPress Installation using MOJO Marketplace" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mojo-beginwpinstall.png" alt="Begin WordPress Installation using MOJO Marketplace" width="520" height="228" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32283" /></p>
<p>MOJO Marketplace will now ask you where you want to install WordPress. Simply select your domain name from the dropdown menu and click on the check domain button. </p>
<p><img title="Choose the domain where you want to install WordPress" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mojo-choosedomain.png" alt="Choose the domain where you want to install WordPress" width="520" height="254" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32284" /></p>
<p>The installer will now check that everything is in order and will show the final step. You can check the box next to Show Advanced Options to expand it. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress installation settings in MOJO Marketplace" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mojo-installoptions.png" alt="WordPress installation settings in MOJO Marketplace" width="520" height="420" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32285" /></p>
<p>You will notice that MOJO Marketplace has already given your site a title &#8216;My Site&#8217;. It will be using your email address as the username and entered a random strong password. You can change all these settings. You also need to check the terms and conditions checkbox. </p>
<p>Once you are done, you can click on the Install Now button. </p>
<p>Your installation will begin, and you will be able to see a progress bar. It will take only a few minutes. You need to wait on this page for it to finish. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress installation progress in MOJO Marketplace" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mojoinstallprogress.png" alt="WordPress installation progress in MOJO Marketplace" width="520" height="189" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32286" /></p>
<p>Once the installation is finished, you will see a success message with a view credentials button. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress Installation finished" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mojoinstallfinish.png" alt="WordPress Installation finished" width="520" height="168" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32287" /></p>
<p>You have successfully installed WordPress. Click on the View Credentials button to go to MOJO Marketplace dashboard and scroll down to the notification center. </p>
<p>There you will see the status of your WordPress install with a link to view credentials. </p>
<p><img title="Notification center" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mojonotification.png" alt="Notification center" width="520" height="258" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32288" /></p>
<p>This will display the installation status and success notice. You will also find links to your site and WordPress admin area along with the username and password you will need to login. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress login credentials after finishing installation using MOJO Marketplace" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wplogininfo.png" alt="WordPress login credentials after finishing installation using MOJO Marketplace" width="520" height="259" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32289" /></p>
<h4 id="installsoftaculous">How to Install WordPress using Softaculous</h4>
<p>Softaculous is a popular auto-installer script. It allows you to easily install popular web applications like WordPress with just a few clicks. Hosting companies like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="SiteGround" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/siteground/" data-shortcode="true">SiteGround</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="InMotion Hosting" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/inmotionhosting/" data-shortcode="true">InMotion Hosting</a> use Softaculous in their control panel.</p>
<p>Simply login to your cPanel account and look for Softaculous icon or WordPress installer icon. You will find them under Auto Installers section. </p>
<p><img title="Softaculous icon under auto installers section in cPanel" src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/softaculous-icon.png" alt="Softaculous icon under auto installers section in cPanel" width="520" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32276" /></p>
<p>Clicking on any of these icons will launch Softaculous auto-installer for WordPress. First you will see an overview of WordPress. You need to click on the Install tab to continue. </p>
<p><img title="Click on the install tab to continue installing WordPress using Softaculous" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/softaculous-installwp.png" alt="Click on the install tab to continue installing WordPress using Softaculous" width="520" height="288" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32277" /></p>
<p>Softaculous will now ask you where you want to install WordPress. You need to choose <code>http://</code> or <code>http://www.</code> as protocol. </p>
<p>If your site has <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-ssl-and-https-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add SSL and HTTPS in WordPress">SSL and HTTPS</a>, then you can select <code>https://</code> or <code>https://www.</code> as protocol. </p>
<p>After that, you need to choose the domain name where you want to install WordPress. Most users want to install WordPress in their domain&#8217;s root directory, like example.com. In that case, you need to make sure that the &#8216;In Directory&#8217; field is blank. </p>
<p>Scroll down a little, and you will see the site settings section. </p>
<p><img title="Editing site settings during WordPress installation using Softaclous" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/softaculous-sitesettings.png" alt="Editing site settings during WordPress installation using Softaclous" width="520" height="405" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32278" /></p>
<p>Under this section, first you need to provide a title and description for your WordPress site. Don&#8217;t worry you can easily change them from your WordPress <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/admin-area/" title="Admin Area">admin area</a> after installation. </p>
<p>Next, you need to choose an admin username, password, and email address. Softaculous will automatically fill in the username and password fields for you. It will use a non-dictionary word for username and a strong password. </p>
<p>You can change them if you want so that they are easy to remember for you. However, we strongly urge you to always use a strong password. See our guide on the <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-the-best-way-to-manage-passwords-for-wordpress-beginners/" title="What is the Best Way to Manage Passwords for WordPress Beginners">best way to manage passwords for WordPress beginners</a> to learn how you can manage strong passwords easily. </p>
<p>Make sure that you enter correct email address in the admin email field. This is where WordPress will send notifications and password reset link if you ever forgot your password. </p>
<p>Rest of the options on the screen are optional. You can now click on the install button to run the installer. </p>
<p><img title="Click on the install button to run the WordPress installer" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/softaculous-runinstaller.png" alt="Click on the install button to run the WordPress installer" width="520" height="405" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32279" /></p>
<p>Softaculous will run the installer using the settings you provided. You will see a progress bar with installation status. It will take a couple of minutes, do not close the window until the progress bar reaches 100% otherwise this may affect your WordPress installation. </p>
<p><img title="Softaculous WordPress installer progress" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/softaclous-wpinstallprogress.png" alt="Softaculous WordPress installer progress" width="520" height="324" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32280" /></p>
<p>You will see a success message after the installation is finished. It will also show you a link to your website and another link to your WordPress admin area. </p>
<p><img title="Softaculous successfully installed WordPress on your website" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/softaculous-success.png" alt="Softaculous successfully installed WordPress on your website" width="520" height="292" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32281" /></p>
<h4 id="quickinstall">How to Install WordPress using QuickInstall</h4>
<p>QuickInstall is another popular auto-installer used by many hosting companies like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="HostGator" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostgator/" data-shortcode="true">HostGator</a> and others. We will be using HostGator&#8217;s cPanel dashboard in the screenshots here, but it wouldn&#8217;t be much different if you are using some other host that has QuickInstall. </p>
<p>First you need to login to your hosting account&#8217;s cPanel dashboard. Scroll down to the Software and Services section and then click on the QuickInstall icon. </p>
<p><img title="QuickInstall in cPanel dashboard" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/quickinstall-cpanelicon.png" alt="QuickInstall in cPanel dashboard" width="520" height="196" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32290" /></p>
<p>This will take you to the 1-Click Installers page on QuickInstall. You will see that it offers installations for most popular web applications including WordPress. You need to click on WordPress to launch the WordPress installer.  </p>
<p><img title="Launching WordPress installer in QuickInstall" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/quickinstall-wp.png" alt="Launching WordPress installer in QuickInstall" width="520" height="279" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32291" /></p>
<p>This will take you to the WordPress installer where you will see an overview of the software. Simply click on the &#8216;Install WordPress&#8217; button to continue. </p>
<p><img title="Launch WordPress installer in QuickInstall" src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/instllwp.png" alt="Launch WordPress installer in QuickInstall" width="520" height="202" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32292" /></p>
<p>This will bring you to setup your WordPress install settings. </p>
<p>First you need to choose the domain name. If you want to install WordPress in a sub-directory like example.com/blog then you need to enter blog in the install path field. Leave it blank if you want to install WordPress in the root directory, like example.com. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress installation settings in QuickInstall" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/quickinstall-wpsettings.png" alt="WordPress installation settings in QuickInstall" width="520" height="447" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32293" /></p>
<p>You need to provide a title for your site, this could be anything and you can always change it later. Next, you need to provide a username, password, and email address for the admin account. You will also need to enter first and last name for the admin user. </p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the settings, click on Install WordPress button to begin the installation. </p>
<p>QuickInstall will now install WordPress for you. You will see a progress bar and later success message when it is done. </p>
<p>Click on the drop down icon next to view credentials button in the success message. A fly down menu will appear with login credentials and a link to the admin area of your newly installed WordPress site. </p>
<h4 id="installfantastico">How to Install WordPress using Fantastico</h4>
<p>Fantastico is a common auto-installer script used by some WordPress hosting providers. It is similar to the other installer scripts in the list, and offers an easy way to quickly install WordPress. </p>
<p>First you need to login to your cPanel dashboard. Scroll down to software and services section, and there you will find the Fantastico icon. </p>
<p><img title="Fantastico icon in cPanel" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fantastico-cpanel.png" alt="Fantastico icon in cPanel" width="520" height="155" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32296" /></p>
<p>Clicking on Fantastico icon will launch the auto-installer script. </p>
<p>Some hosting providers are still using an older version of Fantastico. In this tutorial we will be showing you screenshots from Fantastico F3 version. If Fantastico on your host looks different, then don&#8217;t worry. Basic installation steps are the same, and you should be able to easily follow them. </p>
<p>On the main Fantastico screen you will see a list of web applications on your left. You need to click on Blogs, and there you will find WordPress listed among many other applications. </p>
<p>Clicking on WordPress will show you an overview of the application with a Install button. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress installer overview in Fantastico" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fantastico-wordpress.png" alt="WordPress installer overview in Fantastico" width="520" height="311" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32297" /></p>
<p>Simply click on the &#8216;Click here to install WordPress&#8217; button to continue. </p>
<p>Fantastico auto-installer for WordPress will now ask you to fill in your installation settings. First you need to choose the domain where you want to install WordPress. </p>
<p><img title="Fantastico WordPress installation settings" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fantasticowpinstall1.png" alt="Fantastico WordPress installation settings" width="520" height="430" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32298" /></p>
<p>If you want to install WordPress in a sub-directory then you can enter the sub-directory name in the field below. Otherwise, make sure that this field is empty. </p>
<p>Under Administrator Details section, you need to provide admin user account information. Enter a username, password, and email address for your WordPress admin account. </p>
<p>Click on the Submit button to continue. </p>
<p>Fantastico will now install WordPress for you. You will be able to see the installation progress. Once it has finished installing WordPress you will see a success message. </p>
<h4 id="installftp">How to Install WordPress using FTP</h4>
<p>Manually installing WordPress is also known as the famous 5 minute install. However, manual installation has a few added steps, and you will need an <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/6-best-ftp-clients-for-wordpress-users/" title="6 Best FTP Clients for WordPress Users">FTP client</a> for that. Take a look at our beginner&#8217;s guide on how to <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-use-ftp-to-upload-files-to-wordpress-for-beginners/" title="How to use FTP to upload files to WordPress for Beginners">use FTP to upload WordPress files</a>.</p>
<p>First thing you need to do is download the <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank" title="Download WordPress" rel="nofollow">latest version of WordPress</a>. Unzip the file, and use the FTP software to upload the files into your web host directory of your choice.</p>
<p><img title="uploading WordPress files using an FTP client" src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/uploadwpfiles.png" alt="uploading WordPress files using an FTP client" width="520" height="285" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32299" /></p>
<p>If you want to install WordPress on your root domain name (like example.com), then you need to upload WordPress files to your website&#8217;s root directory. Usually this directory is called /public_html/. </p>
<p>On the other hand, If you want to install WordPress in a subfolder (like example.com/blog), then upload it in a folder /public_html/blog/. </p>
<p>Once you are done uploading WordPress, go to your hosting control panel to create a database. We are using cPanel web hosting, so our screenshots will be of cPanel. In your cPanel, find the icon like this:</p>
<p><img title="MySQL databases in cPanel" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mysqlicon.jpg" alt="MySQL databases in cPanel" width="508" height="103" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32300" /></p>
<p>You will see a field to create a new database. Enter your database name, and click “Create Database”. </p>
<p><img title="Creating a new database for your WordPress site" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/newdb.png" alt="Creating a new database for your WordPress site" width="520" height="123" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32301" /></p>
<p>Now that you have created your database, MySQL still needs a username. This username will have access to perform actions on the database. </p>
<p>On the MySQL Databases page in your cPanel account, scroll down to MySQL Users section. Simply provide a username and password for your new user and click on the &#8216;Create a user&#8217; button. </p>
<p><img title="Creating a new MySQL user" src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mysqluser.png" alt="Creating a new MySQL user" width="520" height="229" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32304" /></p>
<p>This new user still does not have access to the database you created earlier. For that you will need to add the user to the database and give them permissions to perform all actions. </p>
<p>On the same MySQL Databases page in your cPanel account, scroll down to &#8216;Add User to a Database&#8217; section. Select the database user you created from the dropdown menu next to user, then select database, and click on the add button. </p>
<p><img title="Adding a user to database" src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/addusertodb.png" alt="Adding a user to database" width="520" height="126" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32305" /></p>
<p>You will be now asked for the privileges you want to allow this user. Select all privileges and click on the Make changes button. </p>
<p>Your MySQL database and user are now ready, and it is time to run the WordPress install.</p>
<p>Simply go to to the URL where you uploaded WordPress. If it is in the main domain, then enter your domain name in the browser window, like yoursite.com or www.yoursite.com. </p>
<p>You will see the language selection page. You can choose a language here so that rest of the installation is displayed in your own language. You can also use English for now and then later change the language. </p>
<p><img title="Choosing language during WordPress installation" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wpinstall-language.png" alt="Choosing language during WordPress installation" width="520" height="319" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32302" /></p>
<p>Click on the continue button to proceed. </p>
<p>You will now see some installation instructions. Basically WordPress will now tell you that it will need your database name, password, and mysql host information. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress installation requirements" src="http://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wpinstall-setupinstructions.png" alt="WordPress installation requirements" width="520" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32303" /></p>
<p>Click on the &#8216;Let&#8217;s go&#8217; button to continue. </p>
<p>WordPress will now show you a form. You need to enter the name of the database you created earlier. </p>
<p><img title="Enter your database information for WordPress installation" src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wpinstall-dbsettings.png" alt="Enter your database information for WordPress installation" width="520" height="310" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32310" /></p>
<p>Fill in the information and then click on submit button. WordPress will now connect to your database and will show you a success message. </p>
<p><img title="WordPress can now connect to your database" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wpdbconnected.png" alt="WordPress can now connect to your database" width="520" height="203" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32306" /></p>
<p>Click on &#8216;Run the Install&#8217; button to continue. </p>
<p>WordPress will now create tables in your database and then send you to the next step of the installation. </p>
<p>Now you need to provide some information for WordPress to setup your site. This includes site title, username, password, and admin email address. </p>
<p>If you do not want your website to be visible to search engines, then you can check the box next to search engine visibility. Later when you are ready you can change this from WordPress settings. If you are unsure about what to do, then simply leave it unchecked. </p>
<p><img title="Setting up your website during WordPress install" src="http://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wpsitesettings.png" alt="Setting up your website during WordPress install" width="520" height="372" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32307" /></p>
<p>Click on the Install WordPress button to continue. WordPress will setup your website and finish the installation. </p>
<p>You will see a success message showing your username. You can now click on the Log in button to sign in to your WordPress site. </p>
<p><img title="Manual WordPress installation finished" src="http://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wpinstallsuccess.png" alt="Manual WordPress installation finished" width="520" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32308" /></p>
<h4 id="installlocal">How to Install WordPress in your Computer</h4>
<p>Many of our beginner level users often ask us if they could try WordPress on their computer? The answer is yes, but most beginners should not do that. </p>
<p>The reason why some folks install WordPress in a local server environment is to build themes, plugins, or to test things out.</p>
<p>If you want to run a blog for other people to see, then you do not need to install WordPress in your computer. If you install WordPress locally in your computer, then the only person who can see the site is you.</p>
<p>If you want to make your WordPress site available to the internet (rest of the world), then you need to get a <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" title="WordPress Web Hosting">web hosting</a> account and install WordPress by using one of the methods we showed above.</p>
<p>Having that said, if you are really interested in installing WordPress locally on your computer to learn more about theme development, test plugins etc, then we highly encourage you to do so.</p>
