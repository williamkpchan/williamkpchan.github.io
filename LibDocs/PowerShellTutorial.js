'<h3>What is PowerShell?</h3>\nWindows PowerShell is object-oriented automation engine and scripting language. \nIt is designed mainly for the system administrators. \nIt helps IT, professionals, to control & automate the administration of the Window OS and other applications. \n\n',
'<h3>Features of Powershell</h3>\n<k>PowerShell Remoting</k>: PowerShell allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine.\n<k>Background Jobs</k>: It helps you to invoked script or pipeline asynchronously. \nYou can run your jobs either on the local machine or multiple remotely operated machines.\n<k>Transactions</k>: Enable cmdlet and allows developers to perform\n<k>Evening:</k> This command helps you to listen, forwarding, and acting on management and system events.\n<k>Network File Transfer:</k> Powershell offers native support for prioritized, asynchronous, throttled, transfer of files between machines using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) technology.\n\n',
'<h3>How to launch PowerShell</h3>\nPowerShell is pre-installed in all latest versions of Windows. \nTo launch PowerShell we need to follow the given steps: \n<k>Step 1)</k> Search for PowerShell in Windows. \nSelect and Click <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT1.png">\n<k>Step 2)</k> Power Shell Window Opens \n<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT2.png">\n\n',
'<h3> PowerShell Cmdlet</h3>\nA cmdlet which is also called Command let is a lightweight command used in the Window base PowerShell environment. \nPowerShell invokes these cmdlets in the command prompt. \nYou can create and invoke cmdlets command using PowerShell APIS. \n\n',
'<h3>Cmdlet vs. Command:</h3>\nCmdlets are different from commands in other command-shell environments in the following manners −\nCmdlets are .NET Framework class objects It can\'t be executed separately\nCmdlets can construct from as few as a dozen lines of code\nParsing, output formatting, and error presentation are not handled by cmdlets\nCmdlets process works on objects. \nSo text stream and objects can\'t be passed as output for pipelining\nCmdlets are record-based as so it processes a single object at a time\n\nMost of the PowerShell functionality comes from Cmdlet\'s which is always in verb-noun format and not plural. \nMoreover, Cmdlet\'s return objects not text. \nA cmdlet is a series of commands, which is more than one line, stored in a text file with a .ps1 extension. \n\nA cmdlet always consists of a verb and a noun, separated with a hyphen. \nSome of the verbs use for you to learn PowerShell is:\n<k>Get </k>— To get something\n<k>Start</k> — To run something\n<k>Out</k> — To output something\n<k>Stop</k> — To stop something that is running\n<k>Set </k>— To define something\n<k>New</k> — To create something \n\n',

'<h3>Applications of Powershell</h3>\nToday, PowerShell has become an ideal choice for IT administrators as it eases management operation and effort in large corporate networks. \nFor example, let\'s assume that you are managing a large network which contains more than four hundred servers. \nNow you want to implement a new security solution. \nThis security solution depends on a certain service which needs to run on those servers. \n\nYou can surely log in to each server and see if they have that service install and running or not. \nHowever, it certainly takes a lot of human errors as your staff needs to spend lots of time on this non-productive process. \n\nHowever, if you use PowerShell, then you could complete this task in just a few minutes. \nThat\'s because the entire operation is done with a single script which gathers information about the services running on the servers. \n\n<k>Summary</k> \nWindows PowerShell is object-oriented automation engine and scripting language\nPowershell offers a well-integrated command-line experience for the operation system\nPowerShell first version 1.0 was released in 2006\nPowerShell allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine\nPowerShell is pre-installed in all latest versions of Windows\nA cmdlet is a lightweight command used in the Window base PowerShell environment\nGet, Start, Out, Stop, Set, New are important PowerShell commands \nBoolean, Byte, Chat, Decimal, Decimal, Long are important Data Type of PowerShell \n$Error. \n$Host, $Profile, $PID, $PSUICulture, $NULL are some special variable used in PowerShell \nThe Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment(ISE) is the default editor for PowerShell\nPowerShell deeply integrates with the Windows OS whereas Command Prompt is a default command line interface which provided by Microsoft\nPowerShell has become an ideal choice for IT administrators as it eases management operation and effort in large corporate networks\n\n\n',
'<h3>create and run scripts in the PowerShell ISE</h3>\nYou can open and edit Windows PowerShell files in the Script Pane. \nSpecific file types of interest in Windows PowerShell are script files (<k>.ps1</k>), script data files (<k>.psd1</k>), and script module files (<k>.psm1</k>). \nThese file types are syntax colored in the Script Pane editor. \nOther common file types you may open in the Script Pane are configuration files (<k>.ps1xml</k>), XML files, and text files.\n\nNote\n\nThe Windows PowerShell execution policy determines whether you can run scripts and load Windows PowerShell profiles and configuration files. \nThe default execution policy, Restricted, prevents all scripts from running, and prevents loading profiles. \nTo change the execution policy to allow profiles to load and be used, see\n<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/components/ise//en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy">Set-ExecutionPolicy</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/components/ise//en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing" data-linktype="absolute-path">about_Signing</a>.',

'<o>Some common types of PowerShell APIs:</o>\nCmdlets: Cmdlets are designed to perform specific tasks, and they follow a Verb-Noun naming convention (e.g., Get-Process, Start-Service).\n\n.NET Framework APIs: PowerShell has access to the full range of functionality provided by the .NET Framework.\nThis includes access to classes, methods, and properties available in the .NET Framework, which can be leveraged within PowerShell scripts.\n\nWMI (Windows Management Instrumentation): PowerShell provides cmdlets and classes that enable interaction with WMI, a management technology that provides information about the status and configuration of a system.\n\nREST APIs: PowerShell can interact with REST APIs using cmdlets like Invoke-RestMethod or by making HTTP requests using .NET classes.\n\nCOM Objects: PowerShell can instantiate and interact with COM (Component Object Model) objects, enabling access to a wide range of Windows system functionality.\n\nPowerShell Gallery APIs: PowerShell Gallery is a repository for PowerShell modules and scripts.\nPowerShell APIs are available to interact with the Gallery, including searching for modules, downloading modules, and publishing modules.\n\nThese APIs allow PowerShell scripts and commands to interact with a variety of resources, systems, and services, making it a versatile tool for automation and management tasks on Windows systems.\n\nDevelopers and system administrators can leverage PowerShell APIs to automate repetitive tasks, manage system configurations, gather system information, interact with remote systems, and perform a wide range of administrative functions.',
'<o>PowerShell can interact with COM (Component Object Model) objects</o>, enabling access to a wide range of Windows system functionality.\nHere\'s a detailed explanation of how PowerShell interacts with COM objects:\n\n<o>COM Objects in PowerShell:</o>\nCOM objects are binary interfaces that expose functionality to other applications.\nMany Windows system components and third-party applications expose their functionality through COM objects.\nPowerShell can work with COM objects by utilizing the .NET Framework\'s System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal class to interact with COM objects.\n\n<o>Creating a COM Object in PowerShell:</o>\nTo work with a COM object in PowerShell, you typically use the New-Object cmdlet with the -ComObject parameter followed by the ProgID (Programmatic Identifier) of the COM object.\nFor example, to create an instance of the Windows Script Host Shell object, you can use:\n<o>$wshShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell</o>\n\n<o>Accessing Properties and Methods:</o>\nOnce you have created a COM object, you can access its properties and methods using PowerShell syntax.\nProperties and methods are accessed similarly to accessing properties and methods of PowerShell objects.\nFor example, to display the current directory using the Windows Script Host Shell object:\n\n<o>$currentDirectory = $wshShell.CurrentDirectory\nWrite-Host "Current Directory: $currentDirectory"</o>\n\n<o>Releasing COM Objects:</o>\nIt\'s important to release COM objects when you\'re done using them to avoid memory leaks.\nPowerShell doesn\'t automatically release COM objects like some other languages do.\nYou can release a COM object by setting it to $null or by explicitly calling the ReleaseComObject method from the System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal class.\nFor example:\n<o>[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject($wshShell) | Out-Null\n$wshShell = $null</o>\n\n<o>Error Handling:</o>\nWhen working with COM objects in PowerShell, it\'s important to handle errors that may occur during interactions with COM objects.\nUse try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may arise while working with COM objects.\n\n<o>Security Considerations:</o>\nPowerShell can interact with COM objects that are registered on the system.\nHowever, interaction with COM objects may raise security concerns, so it\'s important to ensure that the COM objects being accessed are safe and secure.\nBy leveraging PowerShell\'s ability to work with COM objects, you can tap into a wide range of Windows system functionality and third-party applications, enabling automation of various tasks and integration with different components of the Windows operating system.',
'<o>Setting Windows 10 Powershell Line Background and Prompt Color Permanently</o>\n\nOne way to do it without code is to launch a PowerShell console, Click on the PowerShell Context Menu icon in the top left corner and select Defaults, (or properties).\nClick on the Colors tab, change the Screen Background color, and ok.\nThen close and restart the PowerShell Console.\n',
