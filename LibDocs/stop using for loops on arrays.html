</em> great. They’re terrific. After all, if your teacher ordered you to write down “I won’t be a bully anymore” 1000 times, you would only wish you had some kind of these loops mounted in your writing hand so you’re able to seamlessly finish the task. And the paper on your desk.
</p>
<p name="ba8d" id="ba8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arrays are amazing as well. Stocking whatever data you want in an infinite space of letters and numbers separated by commas, jailed between two square braces, only fearing a memory leak that would never happen 
	<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">(unless you wanna stock all the data about all the history of mankind in Earth, you’re gonna be okay)
</em>. Lining up the data you want, in the order you want, structured and organized in one of the most flexible basic structures of programming in general, and JavaScript in particular. How sweet.
</p>
<p name="9af0" id="9af0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Combine these two things, and you get a for loop running on an array (whoa!). In fact, these loops do not specifically run on arrays, but whenever a solution on any problem includes “multiple times” and “arrays”, we are more tempted than ever to use the shortest, closest-to-earth solution, which is :
	<br>* declaring a placeholder variable (most of the time, it would hold the name “placeholder”, one of the most creative names one could use)
<br>* running a traditional for loop with our traditional “pointer” variable called i
<br>* doing whatever we need to do with the array, using that magical “i” variable
<br>* manipulate the output value we need and affect it to “placeholder”
<br>* return placeholder.
</p>
<p name="c57d" id="c57d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the thing. Doing this is bad. It’s not like “Robbing is bad” bad, but more like “You shouldn’t be doing that bad stuff anymore, grow up!” bad. It’s ugly. Hard to read, hard for your brain to allow it to synthetize what you just did, and as such, harder to understand, harder to maintain, and harder to debug. And easier to send to trash. You will be pardoned and your life will be spared when you’re actually dealing with a low-level language (such as C), but today, in JavaScript, you simply can’t do this anymore, without having a big bright LED sign reading “NEWBIE HERE” pointing at you if you don’t care to move up the ladder. And trust me, the earlier you do, the better it will be. Much better. Like “black Friday pricing” better.
</p>
<p name="f110" id="f110" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t get me wrong. I used to do this as well. It was all birds chirping and sky being blue and cloudless until I stopped for a try into a website called “CodeWars”. It’s basically a website that, for a specific language of your choice (of course, amongst the available ones on the website), offers a series of challenges that you must pass. In order to pass them, you are given your assignment, and your code will be tested against a sample of several test cases, which should all pass in order to continue. And because you’re basically handling arrays most of the time, all what I was doing is brainlessly writing for loops, tailoring and tinkering and messing with endless if/else if/else clauses just because one test case failed. And of course, when it worked, I was so happy. And then I stated to myself “I LOVE for loops”…. until I realized almost immediately that my approach would be wrong.
</p>
<p name="8adb" id="8adb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After you pass a challenge, you are allowed to see what others have done in order to pass it, ranked by how many “upvotes” they have, and how many people consider the way they used as a “best practice”. And trust me, these “best practices” would shock you, had you not read this post, before trying to make your own way to this beautiful yet somewhat intimidating website. And also, it’s up since a good while, so expect a “best practice” to only receive more upvotes and best practice mentions as random wayfarers pass by, as well as you shouldn’t expect your answer to receive a vote or two.
</p>
<p name="2a63" id="2a63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back to our story, everytime I would take a sneak peek at these solutions, I would always be between surprised and shocked. Techniques that required no loops, that were 90% smaller than my code or approach, but damn effective and functional. The legendary word trio W-T-F was accompanying every attempt of deciphering and thinking how in the world did this guy make it happen, only to discard what I just saw and stubbornly continue with my wrong-yet-working approach. Until I finally started discovering these beautiful methods at Mozilla Developer Network’s related pages, and it was breathtaking — at that moment — how wonderful things can be with a well-sought line or 2.
</p>
<p name="b519" id="b519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Of course, I would not just “read for the sake of reading”. I would have a “sandbox.html” file loaded in my favorite browser, while editing a “sandbox.js” file in my favorite text editor, all of this only to grasp, little by little, the magic of object-oriented programming, when it applies to arrays. Mashing F5 and looking out for what the console printed out, whether it was an error or the dreamed output that I was wishing to have, was never as fun as back in these days.

<p name="09dd" id="09dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the way, I’m listing all these methods by beginning with “Array.prototype.whatever”, but you just call them straight away like “Array.map” or so.

And this counter-example to the whole point of this post would slightly make the “Don’t use for loops at all” feeling become a little less significant, even though I didn’t mention word by word that you should completely get rid of this way to do stuff. In fact, one reason forEach should be discarded, is for performance issues, the only kind of issues that really matters, when it comes to dealing with big software and programs.
