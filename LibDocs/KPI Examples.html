<h1>Key Performance Indicator KPI Examples</h1>
<div id="toc"></div></center>



<pre>
<br>
<strong> In its simplest form, a KPI is a type of performance measurement that helps you understand how your organization or department is performing.</strong>
To be effective, a KPI must:

<li>Be well-defined and quantifiable.</li>
<li>Be communicated throughout your organization and department.</li>
<li>Be crucial to achieving your goal. 
(Hence, key performance indicators.)</li>
<li>Be applicable to your Line of Business (LOB) or department.</li>

The trouble is, there are thousands of KPIs to choose from. 
If you choose the wrong one, then you are measuring something that doesn’t align with your goals. 
<em>How, then, should you go about selecting the right KPIs for your organization?</em>

The best way to accomplish this is by researching and understanding some of the most important KPIs. 
This way, you’ll have a better understanding of which ones are specific to your industry and which ones will be of no benefit.

<h2>18 Key Performance Indicator Examples &amp; Definitions</h2>
<h3>Financial Metrics</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Profit</strong>: This goes without saying, but it is still important to note, as this is one of the most important performance indicators out there. 
Don’t forget to analyze both gross and net profit margin to better understand how successful your organization is at generating a high return.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Measure cost effectiveness and find the best ways to reduce and manage your costs.</li>
<li><strong>LOB Revenue Vs. 
Target</strong>: This is a comparison between your actual revenue and your projected revenue. 
Charting and analyzing the discrepancies between these two numbers will help you identify how your department is performing.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Of Goods Sold</strong>: By tallying all production costs for the product your company is selling, you can get a better idea of both what your product markup should look like and your actual profit margin. 
This information is key in determining how to outsell your competition.</li>
<li><strong>Day Sales Outstanding (DSO)</strong>: Take your accounts receivable and divide them by the number of total credit sales. 
Take that number and multiply it by the number of days in the time frame you are examining. 
Congratulations—you’ve just come up with your DSO number! The lower the number, the better your organization is doing at collecting accounts receivable. 
Run this formula every month, quarter, or year to see how you are improving.</li>
<li><strong>Sales By Region</strong>: Through analyzing which regions are meeting sales objectives, you can provide better feedback for underperforming regions.</li>
<li><strong>LOB Expenses Vs. 
Budget</strong>: Compare your actual overhead with your forecasted budget. 
Understanding where you deviated from your plan can help you create a more effective departmental budget in the future.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Customer Metrics</h3>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</strong>: Minimizing cost isn’t the only (or the best) way to optimize your customer acquisition. 
CLV helps you look at the value your organization is getting from a long-term customer relationship. 
Use this performance indicator to narrow down which channel helps you gain the best customers for the best price.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</strong>: Divide your total acquisition costs by the number of new customers in the time frame you’re examining. 
Voila! You have found your CAC. 
This is considered one of the most important metrics in e-commerce because it can help you evaluate the cost effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Satisfaction &amp; Retention</strong>: On the surface, this is simple: Make the customer happy and they will continue to be your customer. 
Many firms argue, however, that this is more for shareholder value than it is for the customers themselves. 
You can use multiple performance indicators to measure CSR, including customer satisfaction scores and percentage of customers repeating a purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</strong>: Finding out your NPS is one of the best ways to indicate long-term company growth. 
To determine your NPS score, send out quarterly surveys to your customers to see how likely it is that they’ll recommend your organization to someone they know. 
Establish a baseline with your first survey and put measures in place that will help those numbers grow quarter to quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Number Of Customers</strong>: Similar to profit, this performance indicator is fairly straightforward. 
By determining the number of customers you’ve gained and lost, you can further understand whether or not you are meeting your customers’ needs.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Process Metrics</h3>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>Customer Support Tickets</strong>: Analysis of the number of new tickets, the number of resolved tickets, and resolution time will help you create the best customer service department in your industry.</li>
<li><strong>Percentage Of Product Defects</strong>: Take the number of defective units and divide it by the total number of units produced in the time frame you’re examining. 
This will give you the percentage of defective products. 
Clearly, the lower you can get this number, the better.</li>
<li><strong>LOB Efficiency Measure</strong>: Efficiency can be measured differently in every industry. 
Let’s use the manufacturing industry as an example. 
You can measure your organization’s efficiency by analyzing how many units you have produced every hour, and what percentage of time your plant was up and running.</li>
</ol>
<h3>People Metrics</h3>
<ol start="16">
<li><strong>Employee Turnover Rate (ETR)</strong>: To determine your ETR, take the number of employees who have departed the company and divide it by the average number of employees. 
If you have a high ETR, spend some time examining your workplace culture, employment packages, and work environment.</li>
<li><strong>Percentage Of Response To Open Positions</strong>: When you have a high percentage of qualified applicants apply for your open job positions, you know you are doing a good job maximizing exposure to the right job seekers. 
This will lead to an increase in interviewees, as well.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Satisfaction</strong>: Happy employees are going to work harder—it’s as simple as that. 
Measuring your employee satisfaction through surveys and other metrics is vital to your departmental and organizational health.</li>

<h2>13 Bonus Key Performance Indicator Examples &amp; Definitions</h2>
<h3>People Metrics</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Retirement Rate</strong>: This metric is particularly important for any organization developing a strategic workforce plan. 
It can be calculated by looking at the number of employees who retired as a percentage of the total headcount. 
If you do not have an aging workforce, turnover is a good measure as well.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Achieved With Training</strong>: Helps the company see the effectiveness of employee training. 
It can be determined by creating an exam and monitoring exam pass rate percent, average score percent. 
If you are a larger organization, you may conduct a pre-test before training and then a post-test after training to see specifically what was learned.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Promotions Vs. 
External Hires</strong>: This ratio measures how many people working at a company are considered for internal promotions versus the number of external hires. 
It can be particularly effective when looking at organizational succession planning.</li>
<li><strong>Salary Competitiveness Ratio (SCR)</strong>: Used to evaluate the competitiveness of compensation options. 
This ratio is determined by dividing the average company salary by the average salary offered by competitors or by the rest of your industry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Customer Metrics</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Customer Churn Rate</strong>: This metric indicates the percentage of customers that either fail to make a repeat purchase or discontinue their service during a given period. 
Formula: (Number of Customers Lost in a Given Period) / (Number of Customers at the Start of the Period) = (Customer Churn Rate). 
Make sure you look at the number of customers that should have renewed during that period.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Volume By Channel</strong>: Keeping track of the number of support requests by phone and email allows you to see which method customers prefer, as well as the number of support requests month-to-month.</li>
<li><strong>Percentage Of Customers Who Are “Very” Or “Extremely” Satisfied</strong>: Determining this metric opens up an opportunity for further surveying what makes happy customers so satisfied. 
This is also a good measure to look at over time, so keep your questions consistent on your surveys. 
Formula: (Customers Who Consider Themselves “Very” or “Extremely” Satisfied) / (Total Survey Respondents) = (Percentage of Customers Who Are “Very” or “Extremely” Satisfied).</li>
<li><strong>Number Of New Vs. 
Repeat Site Visits</strong>: Allows companies to differentiate their website traffic and generate insights on prospective customers. 
Formula: (Website Visits by New Visitors) / (Total Website Visits) = percent of new visitors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Financial Metrics</h3>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Cash Flow From Financing Activities</strong>: This metric demonstrates an organization’s financial strength. 
Formula: (Cash Received from Issuing Stock or Debt) – (Cash Paid as Dividends and Reacquisition of Debt/Stock) = (Cash Flow from Financing Activities).</li>
<li><strong>Average Annual Expenses To Serve One Customer</strong>: This is the average amount needed to serve one customer. 
Formula: (Total Expenses) / (Total Customers) = (Average Annual Expenses to Serve One Customer).</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, &amp; Amortization)</strong>: Measures revenue after expenses are considered and interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are excluded. 
Formula: (Revenue) – (Expenses Excluding Interest, Tax, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) = (EBITDA).</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Spending</strong>: This metric shows the amount of money that an organization spends on innovation. 
Some organizations have this budgeted as research and development, and others have different accounting terms. 
Ultimately, if you use this measure, you are valuing innovation as a key strategic thrust.</li>
<li><strong>(Customer Lifetime Value) / (Customer Acquisition Cost)</strong>: The ratio of customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost should ideally be greater than one, as a customer is not profitable if the cost to acquire is greater than the profit they will bring to a company. 
Formula: (Net Expected Lifetime Profit from Customer) / (Cost to Acquire Customer).</li>

<h2>KPI Key Performance Indicators in Supply Chain & Logistics</h2>
<h2>Supply Chain KPIs are Essential - The Right Ones!</h2>
<strong><em>The information on this page WILL help you get it right.</em></strong>
Many people get confused about KPIs or Key Performance Indicators in Logistics and Supply Chain operations. 
Which ones to use?&#8230; How many to use?
Sadly, it’s not such an easy question to answer. 
Still, in this article, I will try to help you evaluate the need for supply chain and logistics KPIs in your organization, and to identify which types of measurement might be most appropriate.
I’ll conclude with a case study illustrating why the above headline talks about the importance of choosing the right KPIs. 
First though, let’s walk through why KPIs are important, and some of the principles for applying them successfully.
<h3><strong>A Couple of KPI Do's and Don'ts</strong></h3>Of course, your supply chain and logistics KPIs need to be SMART—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-phased—but this may too rudimentary a set of rules to ensure KPIs are useful. 
Later in this article, I will suggest some rather more comprehensive guidelines, but for now, aside from applying the SMART acronym, my basic take on KPIs is this…
1) Don’t have too many! I’ve seen KPI 'packs' the size of phone books, and even KPI sets circulated as a monthly magazine… that no one reads. 
Remember what the K stands for!
2) Make sure they 'tie' in with your goals and objectives. 
Do they directly support those objectives?

Unfortunately, even these most basic standards imply that many of your supply chain KPIs may not be stock-standard ones. 
However, in Supply Chain, you would generally expect to see the following standard set, along with those that are more specific to your business needs.

<li><strong>DIF</strong> – Delivery in Full</li><li><strong>DOT</strong> – Delivery on Time</li><li><strong>DIFOT</strong> – Delivery In Full on Time</li><li>Cost as a percentage of sales (Logistics or Supply Chain)</li><li>Inventory stock turns in Days.</li>

<h2>KPIs in Supply Chain – The Basics</h2>As in any business activity, supply chain operations need to focus doggedly on improvement to compete in the market place, but how do you know if your supply chain performance is satisfactory, or if it is getting better, or worse?
That’s where KPIs come in.
<h3><strong>What’s a KPI, Anyway?</strong></h3>KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator, and can be defined as a practical and objective measurement of progress, either:

<li>Towards a predetermined goal, or</li><li>Against a required standard of performance</li>
<blockquote><h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>It might help to think of a KPI as something like an instrument on a car dashboard—a speedometer, for example.</em></h3></blockquote>If you are driving your car and you wish to maintain a speed of 50 KPH, you will use your speedometer to maintain that velocity. 
You will drive a little faster if your speedometer needle drops below 50KPH or you will slow down if it climbs above the required speed.
You will use a KPI in the same way as your car’s speedometer. 
The only difference is that in most cases, you wouldn’t wish to lower performance when a business activity exceeds the required standard. 
As a similar, and perhaps more accurate example, if your car has a fuel consumption gauge and you use this to try to drive economically, then you are making use of a bona fide KPI.

<h2>Why Are KPIs Important?</h2>Using KPIs for performance measurement ensures that you are always evaluating your business activity against a static benchmark. 
That makes fluctuations immediately visible, and if performance moves in the wrong direction, you can quickly respond.
When a KPI shows that performance is consistently meeting or exceeding the required level, you can decide to raise the bar and set a higher standard to achieve. 
For this reason, KPIs are essential for any business improvement strategy.
<blockquote><h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>Apart from an internal desire to improve and compete, KPIs play a part in attracting and retaining customers. 
</em></h3></blockquote>That’s especially true in any business where customers tie into agreements or contracts. 
Service level agreements, in particular, will be monitored through KPIs agreed between an enterprise and its customer, with the probable application of penalties should performance fall below agreed levels.
In short, KPIs provide visibility of business performance and allow objective quantitative and qualitative evaluation. 
When you align them with business goals, they take away the guesswork and sharpen the focus on improvement.

<h2>Supply Chain KPIs</h2>

When measuring the effectiveness and cost of your supply chain, you will need to set up and monitor KPIs that give visibility of cross-functional activity as well as those applicable to individual supply chain components.
Later in this article, we’ll look at some examples of functional and cross-functional KPIs. 
Broadly speaking though, the following areas are those where KPIs will be necessary:

<li>Order capture</li><li>Inventory management</li><li>Purchasing and supplier management</li><li>Production/manufacturing</li><li>Warehousing</li><li>Transportation</li>
Cross functional KPIs are likely to provide snapshots of the following end-to-end performance factors:

<li>Perfect order (the degree of accuracy to which customers’ requirements are being met)</li><li>Inventory levels</li><li>Stock losses and/or damages</li><li>Gross profit</li><li>Cost of goods sold</li><li>Total logistics cost</li>
Try to construct cross-functional KPIs in a way that allows each function to see its contribution to overall supply chain performance.

<h2>Why Do Companies Have Too Many KPIs?</h2>At the beginning of this article, I stressed the importance of not having too many KPIs. 
In the course of my consulting activity, I come across this issue repeatedly. 
The most common cause is a state of confusion about what constitutes a KPI.
<blockquote><h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>Let me try to clarify. 
A KPI is a metric&#8230; but not just any metric. 
A KPI is a metric focused on a KEY element of business, departmental, or team performance. 
</em></h3></blockquote>There is nothing intrinsically wrong with capturing a large number of metrics, especially with today's sophisticated analytics software solutions to help. 
However, it is beyond realistic to expect anyone to scrutinize them all on a day-to-day or even week-to-week basis.
KPIs should comprise a handful of metrics that your teams CAN realistically monitor and react to continuously. 
They don't need to be exceptionally granular, but should instead track the most vital elements of supply chain performance.
<h3><strong>How Many are Too Many?</strong></h3>Of course, the difference between KPIs and metrics will vary at different levels of your organisation, so while a metric recording 'receiving accuracy' in a warehouse would undoubtedly be a KPI for a warehouse manager, it would be utterly extraneous as an executive-level KPI.
<blockquote><h3><em>In determining your supply chain KPI suite then, the secret is to identify performance elements critical to those with the power to influence them, and develop appropriate KPIs for that audience. 
</em></h3></blockquote>At no level in a function, or cross-functionally though, should anyone need to monitor more than a few KPIs. 
Exactly how many is hard to say and will, in any case, vary from business to business, but frankly, if you are tempted to ask if you have too many KPIs, you probably do.

<h2>The Importance of Hierarchy</h2>

Because of this particular necessity, the development of even half a dozen logistics KPIs will ultimately result in two to three times this number in total… at the very least.
Therefore, as you might imagine, an excess of KPIs will soon have your portfolio approaching the volume of the aforementioned telephone directory, making it hard to monitor and act on the mass of data generated.
Nevertheless, it is essential to have a hierarchy of KPIs, since, as already mentioned, a level of granularity suitable for one level of management will be either too general, or too detailed, for another. 
At the same time, it is not wise to have too many levels in your hierarchy.
<h3><strong>The Two-Level Hierarchy</strong></h3>If you wish to keep things as simple as possible, you should find that two levels, or tiers, of logistics KPIs, are sufficient. 
You might call the highest level the “primary tier,” and the second level the “secondary tier.”
<h4><em>The first-tier KPIs would be the ones monitored at an executive level in your company, and would perhaps include metrics like:</em></h4>
<li>Logistics costs as a percentage of sales</li><li>Inventory turns</li><li>Total inventory days</li><li>Source-to-deliver cycle time (the time from sourcing raw materials to delivery of finished goods)</li><li>DIFOT</li>
<h4><em>At the secondary level, you would have KPIs that provide more granularity and highlight the causes of fluctuations in tier 1 metrics. 
Examples of these secondary KPIs could include:</em></h4><div class=row><div class=column style="width: 40%; padding: 0 10px 0 0; float: left;">
<li>Warehouse costs as % of sales</li><li>Transportation costs as % of sales</li><li>Finished goods inventory turns</li><li>Raw materials inventory turns</li><li>Inventory obsolescence</li><li>Work in progress days</li><li>Finished goods days</li>
</div><div class=column style="width: 40%; padding: 0 10px 0 0; float: left;">
<li>Raw material days</li><li>Inbound delivery in full</li><li>Inbound delivery on time</li><li>Outbound delivery in full</li><li>Outbound delivery on time</li><li>Manufacturing cycle time</li>
</div><div style="clear: both;"><h3></h3><h3><strong>The Three-Level Hierarchy</strong></h3>A three-tier KPI solution is a little more involved, with the top two tiers comprising end-to-end supply chain metrics with Tier 2 being more granular than Tier 1. 
Meanwhile, the third tier can include KPIs that show performance at a functional level, and highlight how each function’s primary activities are contributing to end-to-end performance.
<blockquote><h3><em>Whether you choose a two or three-tier system will depend on the specifics of your company’s business, the company’s size, and other similar factors.</em></h3></blockquote></div>Of course, it’s also possible to add further tiers for even more granularity, but again, the more levels you have, the more complex your KPI solution.
Now let’s get a little more granular in this study of supply chain KPIs, and look at some of the specifics involved in tracking cross-functional and functional performance.

<h2>Cross-Functional and Functional KPIs: How to Apply the Right Ones</h2>Functional KPIs offer value, of course, but when you combine and integrate them to offer an end-to-end view of performance trends, you can magnify that value considerably. 
It can be helpful, therefore, to identify the processes involved in your supply chain before deciding upon the functional-specific measures that collectively, will show how these processes are performing.
You can identify and categorize your company’s processes in any way that suits you. 
Still, it’s worth briefly discussing, as an example, one of the process cycles commonly used when monitoring supply chain performance. 
That cycle typically goes under the heading of order-to-cash.
<h3><strong>Order to Cash</span></strong></h3>Order to Cash (OTC) is the end-to-end process involved in capturing and fulfilling a customer’s order, and can be measured using a carefully coordinated range of functional KPIs. 
The OTC cycle loosely comprises the following sub-processes:

<li>Customer-order capture</li><li>Order picking and packing</li><li>Dispatching, shipping, and delivering the order</li><li>Billing the customer</li><li>Receiving and recording the customer’s payment</li>
OTC is a process that illustrates clearly, how the supply chain comprises a broader range of business functions than you might have thought.
<blockquote><h3><em>For example, the sales function is not typically seen as part of the supply chain, but if your sales team captures orders from your customers, the first step in the supply chain is very much sales-related.</em></h3></blockquote>Similarly, it’s easy to forget that a supply chain comprises the flow of information and money, as well as goods. 
That necessarily implies a need for financial functions to be measured if you want a full picture of end-to-end supply chain performance.
<h3><strong>Who’s Involved in Order to Cash Measurement?</span></strong></h3>When you measure the order-to-cash cycle, you will need to set appropriate KPIs for your sales department, warehousing and transportation functions, and for some areas of finance, such as accounts receivable. 
To illustrate how much this matters, consider the possible consequences of any failure or delay in recording a customer’s payment.
Let's assume a system or process issue that results in the delayed posting of the customer's payment. 
If the customer makes frequent purchases, receipt of payment for the previous delivery might not be recorded before the customer places a fresh order.
Because there is no record of payment, the customer's account might be put on hold in your ERP system, and the whole process of supplying that customer stops until somebody spots the problem and resolves it. 
That’s a supply chain performance issue, just as much as if your warehouse team fails to pick the order.
<h3><strong>Functional KPIs in OTC</span></strong></h3>If you’re beginning to think that order-to-cash cycle measurement sounds incredibly complicated, you can relax a little, because it need not be that hard. 
For one thing, a made-to-measure (see what I did there?) KPI exists that’s relevant to pretty much any type of supply chain operation. 
It’s a composite KPI called <em>perfect order</em>, and it incorporates functional measurements for all stages of the OTC process.
You can use the perfect order KPI to track OTC performance, by breaking it into its components and applying the metrics as relevant to the different functions in your supply chain. 
The breakdown should look something like this:

<li><strong><em>Sales function:</em></strong> Percentage of orders captured accurately (reliant on customer feedback)</li><li><strong><em>Warehouse function:</em></strong> Percentage of orders picked in full</li><li><strong><em>Transport function:</em></strong> Percentage of orders delivered in full; Percentage of on-time deliveries</li><li><strong><em>Finance function:</em></strong> Percentage of orders billed correctly</li><li><strong><em>All functions:</em></strong> Percentage of orders with correct and accurate documentation</li>
The functional KPIs mentioned above are the highest level of metrics that you will use. 
They will likely need breaking down further to maximize identification of performance issues and aid in solution planning—always remembering to keep things simple by only holding people responsible for the KPIs they can directly affect.
<blockquote><h3><em>For instance, in the warehouse, the percentage of orders picked in full might be broken down into…</em></h3></blockquote>
<li>Percentage of orders picked with errors – incorrect quantity</li><li>Percentage of orders picked with errors – incorrect product</li><li>Percentage of order lines picked with errors - incorrect quantity</li><li>Percentage of order lines picked with errors - incorrect product</li>
At this level of granularity, the picking-performance measurement will allow you to see trends and patterns in picking accuracy. 
You might notice, for example, that a significant number of orders are picked with minor errors, or that a small number of orders contains many errors.
Furthermore, by applying codes to highlight the exact nature of each error, you will gain an even higher level of visibility. 
You might notice, for instance, that a particular product is affected more than others by picking errors, and then determine if the problem lies with that product's markings, labels, storage location, or proximity to a similar product in the slotting plan.

<h2>What Makes an Effective KPI Suite?</h2>Earlier, I mentioned that the SMART acronym might be a little too simple to use as a standard for developing KPIs. 
As a more practical guide, you might wish to apply the following list of golden rules when building up a suite of logistics KPIs for your company:
1) Make sure you align all KPIs with the overall business objectives of your company.
2) Ensure that each KPI has an “owner”, whether that is an individual or a group of people.
3) Design each KPI as a leading metric, able to assist with the prediction of performance issues.
4) KPIs should be actionable, providing timely, accurate data that owners can interpret and utilise.
5) Each KPI should be easy for its owners to understand.
6) Each KPI should reinforce and/or balance others.
7) No KPI should contradict or undermine the others.
8) Each KPI should have a target or threshold indicating a minimum-acceptable level of performance.
9) As each KPI is proved stable and effective, it should be reinforced by incentives or compensation.
10) Each KPI should be update-able, as they will lose relevance over time.
The one caveat I would add here, concerning golden rule #9, is that it’s essential to incentivise only behaviours that do not jeopardise health and safety or regulatory compliance, or otherwise put the reputation of your business at risk.

<h2>Success With Supply Chain KPIs: A Brief Case Study</h2>In the early years of this century, a British division of a global brewing company decided to diversify into contract distribution to increase utilization and reduce costs across its national warehousing and logistics operation. 
The company’s customers mainly comprised pubs and restaurants, which were either under individual ownership, or owned by the brewing company.
However, the traditional model for licensed alcohol sales was undergoing a transformation, with most of the major brewers disposing of their estates following freshly introduced laws, implemented to curb what was seen by the government as a barrier to fair competition in the industry.
As a result of these changes, several large pub companies sprang up, and the brewing company (the subject of this study) determined to sell distribution services to these entities. 
It won a porterage contract with one of the largest pubcos and suddenly found itself with one customer that represented more than 50% of its business revenue.
<h3><strong>Threats and Measures: A Catalyst for Change</span></strong></h3>It wasn’t long before problems arose, with the customer threatening to exit the contract under a service-level clause. 
Fortunately, the pubco’s director was an ex-logistics guy who proposed an alternative solution.
The customer and the supplier would work together to develop KPIs that would highlight why many pubs were receiving deliveries with incorrect product quantities, and why even more deliveries were arriving late.
The partners developed a KPI portfolio, which, although hardly simple in the way this article advocates, served to highlight some severe issues in the supplier’s warehouse and transportation functions.
<blockquote><h3><em>The list of KPIs included delivery on-time and in-full (DIFOT). 
The in-full KPI was broken down into factors such as:</em></h3></blockquote></div>
<li>Incorrect product quantity</li><li>Incorrect product quality (wrong products)</li><li>Deliveries with broken products/packaging</li>
These KPIs were then cascaded to even greater levels of granularity, with the use of error codes to identify where and how delivery errors were originating.
<h3></h3><h3><strong>How Supply Chain KPIs Opened Eyes</strong></h3>Over time, the KPIs revealed a range of issues, including picking errors, a lack of checks taking place in the loading of vehicles, unsafe loading practices, unsafe driving, and insufficient load-restraining measures. 
These problems were all carry-overs from an earlier era when the logistics operation primarily served an internal supply chain.
Quite simply, the logistics functions had not adapted to a new environment in which retail outlets were no longer 'tied' to the brewery. 
Instead, customers could choose to take their business where they wished, which was precisely the pub group's intention if delivery performance did not improve.
However, given the visibility provided by the new logistics KPIs, improve it did. 
Within a year, the brewer’s logistics operation was meeting initial “perfect order” targets agreed with the customer and working towards a raised set of service-level objectives.
<h3><strong>The Outcomes Were Significant</strong></h3>Improvement in the brewing company’s service provision was made possible because the KPIs had enabled the partners to identify specific issues, and then agree and implement plans to address them.
As a result, the brewing company not only averted the loss of its biggest customer, but went on to achieve a reputation for excellent distribution services, enabling it to acquire contracts with other major pub groups and become known as a leading beverage logistics provider. 
This success, in turn, helped to strengthen the brand’s presence in the pubs of the groups that it served, and raise its profile in the British beer market.
<h3><strong>Remember the Headline I Began With?</strong></h3>This case study highlights how, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, <strong>THE RIGHT KPIs</strong> can help you drive substantial improvements in your supply chain.
Initially, the KPIs were focused on the outbound supply chain, or more specifically, the last mile. 
Later, the company in question began to follow similar measurement processes in other areas, such as primary distribution (from brewery to distribution centers) and procurement.
In each case, it was the application of appropriate KPIs that made the difference. 
The issue was not that the company had not been measuring performance, but rather, that it had been using metrics that were no longer relevant for serving a transformed marketplace.

<h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Power Pivot</h2>
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are visual measures of performance. 
Based on a specific calculated field, a KPI is designed to help users quickly evaluate the current value and status of a metric against a defined target. 
The KPI gauges the performance of the value, defined by a Base measure (also known as a calculated field in Power Pivot in Excel 2013), against a Target value, also defined by a measure or by an absolute value. 
If your model has no measures, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-measure-in-power-pivot-d3cc1495-b4e5-48e7-ba98-163022a71198">Create a measure</a>.

<h3>More about KPIs</h3>
In business terminology, a KPI is a quantifiable measurement for gauging business objectives. 
For example, the sales department of an organization might use a KPI to measure monthly gross profit against projected gross profit. 
The accounting department might measure monthly expenditures against revenue to evaluate costs, and a human resources department might measure quarterly employee turnover. 
Each is an example of a KPI. 
Business professionals frequently use KPIs that are grouped together in a business scorecard to obtain a quick and accurate historical summary of business success or to identify trends.

A KPI includes:

<h3>Base value</h3>
  A Base value is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value. 
This value, for example, can be created as an aggregate of sales or created to define profit for a given period. 


<h3>Target value</h3>
  A Target value is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value, or by an absolute value. 
For example, a calculated field could be used as a target value where the business managers of an organization want to compare how the sales department is tracking toward a given quota, where the budget calculated field would represent the target value. 
An example where an absolute value would be used as a target value could be where the HR manager would like to evaluate each employee’s number of sick-leave days compared to the average, where the average number of sick-leave days represents the absolute value. 


<h3>Status thresholds</h3>
  A Status threshold is defined by the range between a low and high threshold. 
The Status threshold displays with a graphic to help users easily determine the status of the Base value compared to the Target value.

<h2>Example</h2>
The sales manager at Adventure Works wants to create a PivotTable she can use to quickly display whether or not sales employees are meeting their sales quota for a given period (year). 
For each sales employee, she wants the PivotTable to display the actual sales amount in dollars, the sales quota amount in dollars, and a simple graphic display showing the status of whether or not each sales employee is below, at, or above their sales quota. 
She wants to be able to slice the data by year.

To do this, the sales manager chooses to add a Sales KPI to the AdventureWorks workbook. 
The sales manager will then create a PivotTable with the fields (calculated fields and KPI) and slicers to analyze whether or not the sales force is meeting their quotas. 


In Power Pivot, a calculated field on the SalesAmount column in the FactResellerSales table, which gives the actual sales amount in dollars for each sales employee is created. 
This calculated field will define the Base value of the KPI. 
The sales manager can select a column and click <b>AutoSum</b> on the <b>Home</b> tab or type a formula in the formula bar.

The Sales calculated field is created with the following formula:

Sales:=Sum(FactResellerSales[SalesAmount])

The SalesAmountQuota column in the FactSalesQuota table has a sales amount quota defined for each employee. 
The values in this column will serve as the Target calculated field (value) in the KPI.

The SalesAmountQuota calculated field is created with the following formula:

Target SalesAmountQuota:=Sum(FactSalesQuota[SalesAmountQuota])

<b>Note:</b>  There is a relationship between the EmployeeKey column in the FactSalesQuota table and the EmployeeKey in the DimEmployees table. 
This relationship is necessary so that each sales employee in the DimEmployee table is represented in the FactSalesQuota table.

Now that calculated fields have been created to serve as the Base value and Target value of the KPI, the Sales calculated field is extended to a new Sales KPI. 
In the Sales KPI, the Target SalesAmountQuota calculated field is defined as the Target value. 
The Status threshold is defined as a range by percentage, the target of which is 100% meaning actual sales defined by the Sales calculated field met the quota amount defined in the Target SalesAmountQuota calculated field. 
Low and High percentages are defined on the status bar, and a graphic type is selected.

Key Performance Indicators in Power Pivot

The sales manager can now create a PivotTable adding the KPI’s Base value, Target value, and Status to the Values field. 
The Employees column is added to the RowLabel field, and the CalendarYear column is added as a Slicer.

The sales manager can now quickly view sales status for the sales dept., slice by year the actual sales amount, sales quota amount, and status for each sales employee. 
She can analyze sales trends over years to determine whether or not she needs to adjust the sales quota for a sales employee.

<h2>6 KPI&#x27;s Your Home Services Business Should Be Tracking</h2>
When you own a small business, it can be hard to know how to measure success and make sure you're primed to grow. 
There are, however, tried-and-true KPIs to help you monitor the trajectory of your company and correct the course as you face new challenges.

Running a small business can be daunting and in markets as competitive as HVAC, electrical, garage door repair and plumbing, you need to know how to keep the finger on the pulse of your operation. 
By zeroing in on several key metrics, you can assess where your company is succeeding, where it could be doing more, and what can be done to ensure your business thrives.

<strong>Here are the six KPIs we recommend:</strong>

<strong>1. Sales Revenue</strong>
<a href="https://blog.servicetitan.com/home-services-companies-raise-revenue-25-on-servicetitan">Sales revenue is simply how much money is coming in from the sale of your services</a> (and any products you may offer). 
This is a foundational metric essential for any company to stay in business, hire staff, adjust inventory, and so on. 
It’s also important to look for trends in your sales revenue. 
Do you experience spikes or slow periods during certain seasons? Distinguishing and anticipating these trends can help you make long-term financial decisions and ensure longevity.

<strong>2. Gross Margin</strong>
Your gross margin is your sales revenue minus the cost of providing services, divided by sales revenue. 
Gross margin is expressed as a percentage and can help you track the growth of your business. 
This percentage represents the amount of every dollar from your sales revenue you retain as profit. 
If the percentage is high, your efficiency is good. 
If it is low, then look into increasing productivity.

Tracking expenses — and then properly applying to your bookkeeping every month — <a href="http://www.hvacrbusiness.com/gross-margin-part-1.html">is more complicated than it sounds</a>. 
Remember not to close out your month’s numbers until accurately assigning the expenses to the services provided over that time period. 
Part of this includes tracking materials used from your inventory only when they are used for booked jobs (rather than calculating an incoming stocking order as one large expense for the month).

<strong>3. Monthly Profit/Loss</strong>
There is another number that needs to subtracted from your profit to determine your monthly profit (or loss): fixed and variable operation costs.

Fixed costs are regular costs you pay every month:
<li>Rent</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
<li>Staff salaries</li>
<li>Advertising</li>

Variable costs are unexpected costs that may fluctuate month-to-month, like gas usage, repair services at your office and so on. 
Both fixed and variable costs every month are subtracted by your profits to calculate the money your company is bringing in. 
If you find that your total costs are eating up a significant part of your profits, look into where you can start saving money every month. 
A good rule of thumb is try and keep the total cost of operations (fixed + variable) at 30% or under.

<strong>4. Various Service Metrics</strong>
Do you know how long it usually takes for your techs to perform a certain install? How many service calls your techs can complete in one day? How often you sell a particular service in one month? <a href="https://blog.servicetitan.com/4-key-business-objectives-for-a-growing-home-services-company">The revenue of your average ticket</a>? The close rate of each of your techs? There are many different numbers you can derive from tracking tech performance and customer buying trends. 
Track what you can, and over time you’ll find the the service metrics that are the most valuable for measuring your business’ success.

For Weldon Long, President of Wright Total Indoor Comfort, that metric was revenue per lead. 
<a href="http://www.contractingbusiness.com/archive/value-performance-benchmarks">As Long told Contracting Business:</a> “Revenue per lead is total volume divided by total number of leads, including cancelled leads, sold, lost, everything. 
If a guy had 40 leads in a month and did a total of $100,000 in sales, you have $2,500 per lead. 
That's the best metric we've found."

<strong>5. Customer Retention</strong>
How good is your company at inspiring loyalty among its customers? Returning customers can dramatically increase a home services company’s revenue. 
Use customer service surveys or simple asks on the day of service to gain insight on how many customers keep coming back to your service (and, if possible, why).

<a href="https://customergauge.com/net-promoter-score-nps/">Net Promoter Score</a>, a tool used to gauge the loyalty of one’s customers, asks customers to answer a simple question on a scale of 1-10, “How likely are you to recommend (this company, this product, this experience, this representative) to your friends, family or business associates?” Customers who score between 0 and 6 are unlikely to give you repeat business while customers who score between 9 and 10 are likely to be promoters of your business or service.

If you find that your business is subsisting on many one-time, low-scoring customers, look at your customer services practices or implement retention campaigns (such as discounts) to bring customers back.

<strong>6. Advertising ROI</strong>
If you make the effort to invest in advertising — whether it be online, radio, print, TV or elsewhere — make sure you have some system in place to measure the return on your investment. 
Customer surveys and CSR/tech inquiries to customers can help you understand where new customers and coming from and end costly advertising campaigns that may not be effective. 
If you run various online ads (Facebook, Google PCP, Yelp paid listings, etc.), make sure that you get answers that specify which platform customers are using when they encounter your ads. 
To calculate your advertising ROI, divide the returns (revenue) resulting from the campaign by the cost of the campaign.
