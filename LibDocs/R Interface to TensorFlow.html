<h1>R Interface to TensorFlow made Possible</h1>
<p>TensorFlow, a general purpose numerical computing library, was nominally developed for python and has been proving support for approximately 2 years now. This is one of the reasons why Python has always been preferred over R.</p>
<p>Rstudio (a free and open-source integrated development environment ) made R Interface with TensorFlow plausible. Rstudio formally announced their work on creating R interfaces to TensorFlow at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf</a> on Saturday. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atiYXm7JZv0&amp;t=982s">Here</a> is JJ Allaire, the CEO of Rstudio, addressing the conference.</p>

<p>Interfacing R and TensorFlow has a suite of packages that provides high-level interfaces to deep learning models (Keras) and standard regression and classification models (Estimators). Here we have some interfaces to TensorFlow:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Keras</strong></em>, a language for building neural networks as connections between general purpose layers. R interface to Keras focuses on enabling fast experimentation. You can have a look on the documentation for <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/"><i>R </i><i>I</i><i>nterface to Keras.</i></a></li>
<li><em><strong>tfestimators</strong></em> package, is an <i>R interface to TensorFlow Estimators, </i>with the mian aim to provide a flexible framework and implementation to different models. For a detailed information, read <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/"><i>R Interface to TensorFlow Estimator.</i></a></li>
<li><em><strong>tensorflow</strong></em> is a low-level interface to the TensorFlow computational graph, providing access to the complete TensorFlow API from within R. Read this article on <i><a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/">R Interface to Core TensorFlow API</a>.</i><i><br />
</i></li>
<li><em><strong>tfdatasets</strong></em> package provides access to the Dataset API, including high-level convenience functions for easy integration. Read more on <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfdatasets/"><i>R interface to TensorFlow dataset </i><i>API</i></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the fact that not all users will have complete access to high-end NVIDIA GPU, using GPUs in the cloud has been made possible. Here are a few methods for the same :</p>
<ul>
<li>For Googleâ€™s hosted machine learning engine : <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/cloudml/">cloudml package</a> ,.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For an Amazon EC2 image preconfigured with NVIDIA CUDA drivers, TensorFlow : <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/cloud_server_gpu.html#amazon-ec2">RStudio Server with Tensorflow-GPU for AWS</a></li>
<li>For Ubuntu 16.04: <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/cloud_desktop_gpu.html">cloud desktop with a GPU</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, for a user having required NVIDIA GPU hardware, here are <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/local_gpu.html">steps to set up GPU in the local workstation</a>.</p>
<p>To make this simpler for the users, Rstudio has provided all the resources on <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/"><i>TensorFlow for R</i></a> website. You can also refer <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/getting-started-with-deep-learning-using-keras-in-r/">Deep Learning using Keras and TensorFlow in R</a>.</p>
<h2>Our take on this:</h2>
<p>It has always been a major topic of discussion to choose between R and Python. Python was given the preference as it could be interfaced with TensorFlow and Keras. The creation of R interface with TensorFlow is a good news for all R users.</p>
