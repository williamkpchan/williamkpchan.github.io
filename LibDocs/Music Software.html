<h2>sound font file (.SF2) is required for MIDI synthesis</h2>
<h3>1. Download SoundFont file</h3>
In order to play Mid, Midi files in VLC player, you will need an extra file that is required for the synthesizer to work properly. 
This file is a SoundFont file. 
SoundFont is basically a file format for sample-based instrument sounds. 
This has a deeper background, however if you only need to play General Midi files, these SoundFonts are known to work quite well:

<a href="http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php" rel="nofollow">S. Christian Collins GeneralUser GS</a>- 30 MB
<a href="https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html" class="whitebut ">Fluid General-MIDI Soundfont</a>

<a href="https://keymusician01.s3.amazonaws.com/FluidR3_GM.zip" class="whitebut ">FluidR3_GM.zip</a>

In this case, we will use the GeneralUser sound font which is very complete and lightweight. 
You can download it on the mentioned link, it will contain a zip with multiple files, of our interest is however the sound font file (GeneralUser GS v1.471.sf2), which is necessary to play midi files. 
We will place the file in the same VideoLAN\VLC directory as we don't need it in other places:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.ourcodeworld.com/public-media/gallery/gallery-5e7ba589cb2de.png">

<h3>2. Configuring VLC Player</h3>

Now, you will need the following steps to configure properly VLC to play Midi files. 
Open VLC Player and go to <strong>Tools &gt; Preferences</strong>:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.ourcodeworld.com/public-media/gallery/gallery-5e7ba68fe289a.jpg">

On the emergent dialog, go to the left bottom area and check the <strong>Show All</strong> radio button, this will allow you to see the preferences window with all the available settings of the program:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.ourcodeworld.com/public-media/gallery/gallery-5e7ba70e6aef6.jpg">

Then, on the Advanced Preferences dialog, go to <strong>Input/Codecs &gt; Audio codecs &gt; FluidSynth</strong>. 
On this tab, you will be able to select the SoundFont file downloaded on the first step, just click on <strong>Browse</strong>, select the path to the file and save:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.ourcodeworld.com/public-media/gallery/gallery-5e7bacfb0faf1.jpg">

This should be enough to let you play that Midi file that you want to listen on your computer with VLC.
Audacity does not directly support soundfonts, and Audacity's support for MIDI is very limited.
For working with MIDI, MuseScore is a much better option. 
You can of course do the MIDI work in one program, then export / render the MIDI to a WAV (audio) file and perform additional editing / processing / effects on the audio file using Audacity.

Another option is <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/Reaper" class="whitebut ">, which has an excellent "unlimited" demo version, but it is rather more complicated.</a>
