Handpicked related content:<a href="https://www.netwrix.com/powershell_tutorial_pdf.html?itm_source=blog&amp;itm_medium=context&amp;itm_campaign=powershell&amp;itm_content=none&amp;cID=70170000000kgEZ">Free Download: PowerShell Scripting Tutorial for Beginners</a>
So let's start learning PowerShell.
PowerShell offers both a command-line option and an integrated scripting environment (ISE):
To launch the PowerShell command line, type <em>powershell.exe</em>  in the Windows Start menu. 
You'll see a screen like the following:
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS1.png">

To launch the PowerShell ISE, type <em>powershell_ise.exe</em>  in the Start menu. 
Using the PowerShell ISE is the preferred way to work with the scripting language, because it provides syntax highlighting, auto-filling of commands and other automation features that simplify script development and testing.
<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS2.png"><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS2.png">
</a>
<h3 id="pstopic-2">Preparing to Run PowerShell Scripts</h3>
PowerShell scripts are stored in.ps1 files. 
By design, you cannot run a script by simply double-clicking a file; this helps avoid accidental harm to your systems. 
Instead, to execute a script, right-click it and click “Run with PowerShell”:
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS3.png">

In addition, there is policy that restricts script execution. 
You can check this policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command in PowerShell:
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS4.png">

You will get one of the following values:
Restricted— No scripts are allowed. 
This is the default setting, so you will see it the first time you run the command.
AllSigned— You can run scripts signed by a trusted developer. 
With this setting in place, before executing, a script will ask you to confirm that you want to run it.
RemoteSigned— You can run your own scripts or scripts signed by a trusted developer.
Unrestricted— You can run any script you want.
To start working with PowerShell, you'll need to change the policy setting from Restricted to RemoteSigned using the Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned command:
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS5.png">

<h3 id="pstopic-3">PowerShell Cmdlets</h3>
<h3 id="pstopic-4"> -- About Cmdlets</h3>
A cmdlet is a PowerShell command with a predefined function, similar to an operator in a programming language. 
Here are some key things to know about cmdlets:
There are system, user and custom cmdlets.
Cmdlets output results as an object or as an array of objects.
Cmdlets can get data for analysis or transfer data to another cmdlet using pipes (I'll discuss pipes more in a moment).
Cmdlets are case-insensitive. 
For example, it doesn't matter whether you type “Get-ADUser”, “get-aduser” or “gEt-AdUsEr”.
If you want to use several cmdlets in one string, you must separate them with a semicolon (;).
<h3 id="pstopic-5"> -- Cmdlet Format</h3>
A cmdlet always consists of a verb (or a word that functions as a verb) and a noun, separated with a hyphen (the “verb-noun” rule). 
For example, some of the verbs include:
Get — To get something
Set — To define something
Start — To run something
Stop — To stop something that is running
Out — To output something
New — To create something (“new” is not a verb, of course, but it functions as one)
For practice, try executing the following cmdlets:
Get-Process — Shows the processes currently running on your computer:
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS6.png">

Get-Service — Shows the list of services with their status
Get-Content — Shows the content of the file you specify (for example, Get-Content C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts)
<h3 id="pstopic-6"> -- Available Cmdlets</h3>
Good news — you don't need to memorize all cmdlets. 
You can list all cmdlets by executing the Get-Help -Category cmdlet, which will return the following:
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS7.png">

You can also create your own custom cmdlets.
<h3 id="pstopic-7"> -- Parameters</h3>
Each cmdlet has several parameters that customize what it does. 
The PowerShell ISE will automatically suggest all valid parameters and their types after you type a cmdlet and a hyphen (-):
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS8.png">

For example, the following cmdlet shows all services whose names start with “W”: Get-Service -Name W*
If you forget a cmdlet's parameters, just use a script like the following, which will display the parameters for the Get-Process cmdlet:
Get-Process | Get-Member
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS9.png">

If you still don't find the cmdlet you need, you can make sure the help is current and then get examples for a cmdlet (such as Get-Process) using a script like this:
Update-Help #to update the help data
Get-Help Get-Process -Examples

<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS10.png">

<h3 id="pstopic-8"> -- Aliases </h3>
You can also use aliases, which are shortened cmdlet names. 
For instance, instead of “Get-Help” you can use just “Help”. 
Try running the following two commands and see whether you get the same result:
Start-Process notepad
start notepad
Similarly, to stop this process, you can use either of the following commands:
Stop-Process -Name notepad
spps -Name notepad
To see all aliases, execute the Get-Alias cmdlet.
<h3 id="pstopic-9"> -- Comments</h3>
Leaving comments in a script will help you — and your colleagues — better understand what the script does. 
A string comment is a single line that starts with a number sign (#), and block comments start and end with number signs and angle brackets and spread across multiple lines.
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS11.png">

<h3 id="pstopic-10"> -- Pipes</h3>
A pipe passes data from one cmdlet to another. 
I used a pipe earlier to get all properties of an object.
For example, if you execute the following script, you'll get all services sorted by their status:
Get-Service | Sort-Object -property Status

You can also use a pipe to output text to a file using a script like the following:
"Hello, World!" | Out-File C:\ps\test.txt

You can use multiple pipes. 
For instance, the following script lists all services, with the first pipe excluding stopped services and the second pipe limiting the list to display names only:
Get-Service | WHERE {$_.status -eq "Running"} | SELECT displayname
# “$_.” defines current element in the pipe

<h3 id="pstopic-11"> -- Summary</h3>
Let's quickly summarize the key points of this Windows PowerShell tutorial. 
Now you know how to run PowerShell, how to change execution policy, what a cmdlet is, how to pass data using pipe and how to get object properties. 
Keep in mind that if you forget something, you can always use the Get-Help cmdlet.
I hope you found this PowerShell for beginners useful!

<h2>Select a Theme and Build a User Profile</h2>
The first thing I suggest doing is setting up the color theme for productive coding. 
The default theme is "Dark Console, Light Editor" which is pleasant enough for starting off, but I prefer the "Dark Console, Dark Editor" theme to give code greater contrast and also emulate the natural PowerShell CLI. 
To make this change, navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Colors and Fonts</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Themes</strong>. 
This is also where you can tweak other colors if desired, but the font coloring is pretty decent out of the box.
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/powershell-options-color-dark.jpg">
While you're here, you can also toggle over to the General Settings tab to adjust the AutoSave interval. 
It's set to 2 minutes by default, which I find to be enough to keep me honest, but you can adjust it up or down to suit your taste.
If you want to get fancier, I've actually taken a shine to the <a href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&amp;id=1">Oblivion theme</a> on the <a href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/">Eclipse Color Themes</a> website. 
While not usable in its native form, the XML file can be converted to a PowerShell ISE theme using a <a href="https://github.com/akawhoami/psisetheme">converter</a> provided by akawhoami on GitHub.
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ect-to-ise-converter.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ect-to-ise-converter.jpg"></a>
To load an XML color theme, head back over to the PowerShell ISE <strong>Theme Manager</strong> from my earlier example and choose to import a theme file. 
Oddly enough, there's no simple "import my theme" cmdlet. 
You can set the colors once per workstation, bake in the specific color options in your profile, or use someone's <a href="https://lifeinpowershell.blogspot.com/2014/03/introducing-new-ise-color-theme-cmdlets.html">third party scripts</a>. 
I don't mind doing it manually, or perhaps a reader will show me a better way. 
🙂
<h3>Presenting Code</h3>
If you're going to present code on a projector screen, I'd go back to a light background with dark text. 
Because most projector screens are a white screen, it's not possible to make the background color truly dark &#8211; the projector simply projects "nothing" for black and you end up getting a funky washed out look.
<h3>Build a User Profile</h3>
A profile is a script that is called when PowerShell or PowerShell ISE opens. 
Profile information can live in two locations:

Current User: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\
All Users: %WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\

Additionally, there are three types of profile files:

ISE and Console: profile.ps1
ISE only: Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1
Console only: Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Seems a tad overkill. 
I personally select the current user path and drop in a profile.ps1, then just check for the $psISE variable to determine if the host is running the ISE. 
Here's the path where it sits:

C:\Users\Chris.GLACIER\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1

My profile file is short and sweet, including a fun little message to myself for when I launch the ISE:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Set-Location C:\Dropbox\Code
if ($psISE)
{
Start-Steroids
Clear-Host
Write-Host 'BEAST MODE (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻'
}

This is a very simple profile. 
Here's what it does:

Make sure the execution policy is effectively disabled (requires <em>Running as Administrator</em>)
Set the console location to my Dropbox\Code folder, because that's where I work on PowerShell code in most cases.
Test to see if the $psISE variable exists, meaning that I'm launching the ISE. 
If it does, I start ISESteroids and pump myself up with a little table throwing action.
If I'm in the console, the logic test fails and nothing else happens.

Here's what a fresh ISE session looks like when loaded up:
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/launch-ise.jpg">
The PowerShell console is simpler.
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/launch-console.jpg">
<h3>Run as Administrator</h3>
I run both the ISE and Console as Administrator by changing the shortcut. 
This avoids issues with the execution policy and gives me unfettered authority over the scripting editor. 
Nothing more annoying than running into errors due to permissions on my own computer. 
🙂
To do so, find the shortcut for PowerShell or PowerShell ISE, open the <strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Shortcut</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt; and check the <strong>Run as administrator</strong> box.
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/run-as-admin-ise.jpg">
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
At this point I have what I consider to be a usable copy of PowerShell ISE at my disposal. 
While it may look like a lot has happened, it isn't that much and only happens on a new system. 
I have a master copy of the profile, colors, and portable modules that I clone to my workstations via Dropbox. 
I'm also a huge fan of <a href="http://www.powertheshell.com/isesteroids/">ISESteroids</a>, which I plan to go over in greater depth in the future.

<h2>Learn Powershell in 1 Day </h2>
<h3>What is PowerShell?</h3>
Windows PowerShell is object-oriented automation engine and scripting language. 
It is designed mainly for the system administrators. 
It helps IT, professionals, to control &amp; automate the administration of the Window OS and other applications.
It introduced some compelling new concepts that enable you to extend the
the knowledge you have gained and the scripts that you have created within the Windows Command Prompt and Windows Script Host environments.
It combines the flexibility of scripting, command-line speed, and the power of a GUI-based admin tool. 
It allows you to solve problems efficiently by helping system admin to eliminate future manual labor hours. 
We will go through all the important aspect which you should know to learn PowerShell.

This is a complete guide to PowerShell… let's begin! <strong><a id=tut2></a>Why Use Powershell?</strong>
Here, are some important reason for using Powershell: 
Powershell offers a well-integrated command-line experience for the operation system
PowerShell allows complete access to all of the types in the .NET framework 
Trusted by system administrators.
PowerShell is a simple way to manipulate server and workstation components
It's geared toward system administrators by creating a more easy syntax 
PowerShell is more secure than running VBScript or other scripting languages 
<strong><a id=tut3></a>PowerShell History</strong>
PowerShell first version 1.0 was released in 2006. 
Today, PowerShell is at version 5.1. 
As the year and version gone by, PowerShell's capabilities and hosting environments grew significantly.
<strong>Let See Version wise History of Powershell:</strong> 
PowerShell version 1 supported the local administration of Windows Server 2003 
PowerShell 2.0 was integrated with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. 
This version supports for remoting and enhances the capabilities of PowerShell like transactions, background jobs, events, debugging, etc.
PowerShell 3.0 was released as an internal part of the Windows management framework. 
It was installed on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. 
You can add and scheduled jobs, session connectivity, automatic module loading, etc. 

PowerShell 4.0 was shipped with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. 
In this version added support for desired state configuration, enhanced debugging, network diagnostics.
PowerShell 5.0 was released as internal part of Windows management framework 5. 
The feature offers in this version are remote debugging, class definitions, .NET enumerations, , etc.

<strong><a id=tut4></a>Features of Powershell</strong>
<strong>PowerShell Remoting</strong>: PowerShell allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine.
<strong>Background Jobs</strong>: It helps you to invoked script or pipeline asynchronously. 
You can run your jobs either on the local machine or multiple remotely operated machines.
<strong>Transactions</strong>: Enable cmdlet and allows developers to perform
<strong>Evening:</strong> This command helps you to listen, forwarding, and acting on management and system events.
<strong>Network File Transfer:</strong> Powershell offers native support for prioritized, asynchronous, throttled, transfer of files between machines using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) technology. 

<strong><a id=tut5></a>How to launch PowerShell</strong>
PowerShell is pre-installed in all latest versions of Windows. 
We need to launch PowerShell for that we need to follow the given steps:
<strong>Step 1)</strong> Search for PowerShell in Windows. 
Select and Click <a href=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT1.png class=jh-image-popup-colorbox><img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT1.png alt=""/></a>
<strong>Step 2)</strong> Power Shell Window Opens <a href=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT2.png class=jh-image-popup-colorbox><img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT2.png alt=""/></a>

<strong><a id=tut6></a>PowerShell Cmdlet</strong>
A cmdlet which is also called Command let is a is a lightweight command used in the Window base PowerShell environment. 
PowerShell invokes these cmdlets in the command prompt. 
You can create and invoke cmdlets command using PowerShell APIS. 
<strong><a id=tut7></a>Cmdlet vs. Command:</strong>
Cmdlets are different from commands in other command-shell environments in the following manners − 
Cmdlets are .NET Framework class objects It can't be executed separately
Cmdlets can construct from as few as a dozen lines of code
Parsing, output formatting, and error presentation are not handled by cmdlets
Cmdlets process works on objects. 
So text stream and objects can't be passed as output for pipelining
Cmdlets are record-based as so it processes a single object at a time


Most of the PowerShell functionality comes from Cmdlet's which is always in verb-noun format and not plural. 
Moreover, Cmdlet's return objects not text. 
A cmdlet is a series of commands, which is more than one line, stored in a text file with a .ps1 extension.
A cmdlet always consists of a verb and a noun, separated with a hyphen. 
Some of the verbs use for you to learn PowerShell is: 
<strong>Get </strong>— To get something
<strong>Start</strong> — To run something
<strong>Out</strong> — To output something
<strong>Stop</strong> — To stop something that is running
<strong>Set </strong>— To define something
<strong>New</strong> — To create something 


<strong>PowerShell commands</strong>
Following is a list of important PowerShell Commands:
<strong>Get-Help:</strong> Help about PowerShell commands and topics
Example: Display help information about the command Format-Table Get-Help Format-Table

Powershell scripts are store in .ps1 file. 
By default, you can't run a script by just double-clicking a file. 
This protects your system from accidental harm. 
To execute a script:
Step 1: right-click it and click "Run with PowerShell." <a href=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT9.png class=jh-image-popup-colorbox><img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT9.png alt=""/></a>
Moreover, there is a policy which restricts script execution. 
You can see this policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command.
You will get one of the following output: 
<strong>Restricted</strong>— No scripts are allowed. 
This is the default setting, so it will display first time when you run the command. 

<strong>AllSigned</strong>— You can run scripts signed by a trusted developer. 
With the help of this setting, a script will ask for confirmation that you want to run it before executing. 

<strong>RemoteSigned</strong>— You can run your or scripts signed by a trusted developer. 

<strong>Unrestricted</strong>— You can run any script which you wants to run 


Steps to Change Execution Policy
<strong>Step 1)</strong> Open an elevated PowerShell prompt. 
Right Click on PowerShell and "Run as Administrator" <a href=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT10.png class=jh-image-popup-colorbox><img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT10.png alt=""/></a>
<strong>Step 2)</strong> Enter the Following commands <ol>Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-execution policy unrestricted
Enter Y in the prompt
Get-ExecutionPolicy

<strong><a id=tut12></a>What is PowerShell ISE?</strong>
The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment(ISE) is the default editor for Windows PowerShell. 
In this ISE, you can run commands, writer test, and debug scripts in an in a window base GUI environment. 
You can do multiline editing, syntax coloring, tab completion, selective execution and lots of other things.
Windows PowerShell ISE also allows you to run commands in a console pane. 
However, it also supports panes that you can use to simultaneously view the source code of your script and other tools which you can plug into the ISE.
You can even open up multiple script windows at the same time. 
This is specifically useful when you are debugging a script which uses functions defined in other scripts or modules. 
<a href=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT14.png class=jh-image-popup-colorbox><img src=https://www.guru99.com/images/tensorflow/082918_1415_PowershellT14.png alt=""/></a>
The same script we created in notepad, can be created in ISE <ol>Paste code into the editor
Save Script
Use F5 to run the script
Observe output in the console

PowerShell scripts are really powerful and could do much stuff in fewer lines. 

Variables are declared in the form $&lt;variable&gt;
Variables could be used to hold the output of command, objects, and values.
"Type" of a variable need not be specified.

<strong>PowerShell</strong> </td><td>
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>
PowerShell deeply integrates with the Windows OS. 
It offers an interactive command line interface and scripting language. 
</td><td>
Command Prompt is a default command line interface which provided by Microsoft. 
It is a simple win32 application that can interact and talk with any win32 objects in the Windows operating system. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
PowerShell uses what are known as cmdlets. 
It can be invoked either in the runtime environment or the automation scripts. 
</td><td>
No such features offer by command prompt. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
PowerShell considers them as objects. 
So the output can be passed as an input to other cmdlets through the pipeline. 
</td><td>
Command Prompt or even the *nix shell, the output generated from a cmdlet is not just a stream of text but a collection of objects. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
The PowerShell is very advanced regarding features, capabilities and inner functioning. 
</td><td>
Command prompt is very basic. 
</td></tr></table><strong><a id=tut15></a>Applications of Powershell</strong>
Today, PowerShell has become an ideal choice for IT administrators as it eases management operation and effort in large corporate networks. 
For example, let's assume that you are managing a large network which contains more than four hundred servers. 
Now you want to implement a new security solution. 
This security solution depends on a certain service which needs to run on those servers.
You can surely log in to each server and see if they have that service install and running or not. 
However, it certainly takes a lot of human errors as your staff needs to spend lots of time on this non-productive process.
However, if you use PowerShell, then you could complete this task in just a few minutes. 
That's because the entire operation is done with a single script which gathers information about the services running on the servers.
<strong>Summary</strong>
Windows PowerShell is object-oriented automation engine and scripting language
Powershell offers a well-integrated command-line experience for the operation system
PowerShell first version 1.0 was released in 2006
PowerShell allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine
PowerShell is pre-installed in all latest versions of Windows
A cmdlet is a lightweight command used in the Window base PowerShell environment
Get, Start, Out, Stop, Set, New are important PowerShell commands 
Boolean, Byte, Chat, Decimal, Decimal, Long are important Data Type of PowerShell 
$Error. 
$Host, $Profile, $PID, $PSUICulture, $NULL are some special variable used in PowerShell 
The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment(ISE) is the default editor for PowerShell

<h2>PowerShell Examples</h2>
This page lists some sample scripts I wrote in PowerShell.

Unless stated otherwise, these scripts run in Windows as well as in <a href="https://www.robvanderwoude.com/https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/docs/learning-powershell">PowerShell on Linux</a> (tested in Windows 7 SP1 and Ubuntu Linux 16.04)


Many of these scripts return their results or status as <a href="https://www.robvanderwoude.com/errorlevel.php">errorlevel</a>.


Help is available for some of the scripts (the most recent ones) with the <code>-h</code> switch.

PowerShell itself provides "help" for a script with the <code>-?</code> switch, but this help will only list the allowed parameters without explaining them.

In that case you can check the source code for help on command line arguments (parameters and switches) and to check the meaning of return codes/errorlevels.
