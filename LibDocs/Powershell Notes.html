Scripting Tutorial for Beginners</a><br>So let’s start learning PowerShell.<br>PowerShell offers both a command-line option and an integrated scripting environment (ISE):<br>To launch the PowerShell command line, type <em>powershell.exe</em>  in the Windows Start menu. <br>You’ll see a screen like the following:<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS1.png"><br><br>To launch the PowerShell ISE, type <em>powershell_ise.exe</em>  in the Start menu. <br>Using the PowerShell ISE is the preferred way to work with the scripting language, because it provides syntax highlighting, auto-filling of commands and other automation features that simplify script development and testing.<br><a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS2.png"><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS2.png"><br></a><br><h3 id="pstopic-2">Preparing to Run PowerShell Scripts</h3><br>PowerShell scripts are stored in.ps1 files. <br>By design, you cannot run a script by simply double-clicking a file; this helps avoid accidental harm to your systems. <br>Instead, to execute a script, right-click it and click “Run with PowerShell”:<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS3.png"><br><br>In addition, there is policy that restricts script execution. <br>You can check this policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command in PowerShell:<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS4.png"><br><br>You will get one of the following values:<br>Restricted— No scripts are allowed. <br>This is the default setting, so you will see it the first time you run the command.<br>AllSigned— You can run scripts signed by a trusted developer. <br>With this setting in place, before executing, a script will ask you to confirm that you want to run it.<br>RemoteSigned— You can run your own scripts or scripts signed by a trusted developer.<br>Unrestricted— You can run any script you want.<br>To start working with PowerShell, you’ll need to change the policy setting from Restricted to RemoteSigned using the Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned command:<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS5.png"><br><br><h3 id="pstopic-3">PowerShell Cmdlets</h3><br><h4 id="pstopic-4"> -- About Cmdlets</h4><br>A cmdlet is a PowerShell command with a predefined function, similar to an operator in a programming language. <br>Here are some key things to know about cmdlets:<br>There are system, user and custom cmdlets.<br>Cmdlets output results as an object or as an array of objects.<br>Cmdlets can get data for analysis or transfer data to another cmdlet using pipes (I’ll discuss pipes more in a moment).<br>Cmdlets are case-insensitive. <br>For example, it doesn’t matter whether you type “Get-ADUser”, “get-aduser” or “gEt-AdUsEr”.<br>If you want to use several cmdlets in one string, you must separate them with a semicolon (;).<br><h4 id="pstopic-5"> -- Cmdlet Format</h4><br>A cmdlet always consists of a verb (or a word that functions as a verb) and a noun, separated with a hyphen (the “verb-noun” rule). <br>For example, some of the verbs include:<br>Get — To get something<br>Set — To define something<br>Start — To run something<br>Stop — To stop something that is running<br>Out — To output something<br>New — To create something (“new” is not a verb, of course, but it functions as one)<br>For practice, try executing the following cmdlets:<br>Get-Process — Shows the processes currently running on your computer:<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS6.png"><br><br>Get-Service — Shows the list of services with their status<br>Get-Content — Shows the content of the file you specify (for example, Get-Content C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts)<br><h4 id="pstopic-6"> -- Available Cmdlets</h4><br>Good news — you don’t need to memorize all cmdlets. <br>You can list all cmdlets by executing the Get-Help -Category cmdlet, which will return the following:<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS7.png"><br><br>You can also create your own custom cmdlets.<br><h4 id="pstopic-7"> -- Parameters</h4><br>Each cmdlet has several parameters that customize what it does. <br>The PowerShell ISE will automatically suggest all valid parameters and their types after you type a cmdlet and a hyphen (-):<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS8.png"><br><br>For example, the following cmdlet shows all services whose names start with “W”: Get-Service -Name W*<br>If you forget a cmdlet’s parameters, just use a script like the following, which will display the parameters for the Get-Process cmdlet:<br>Get-Process | Get-Member<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS9.png"><br><br>If you still don’t find the cmdlet you need, you can make sure the help is current and then get examples for a cmdlet (such as Get-Process) using a script like this:<br>Update-Help #to update the help data<br>Get-Help Get-Process -Examples<br><br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS10.png"><br><br><h4 id="pstopic-8"> -- Aliases </h4><br>You can also use aliases, which are shortened cmdlet names. <br>For instance, instead of “Get-Help” you can use just “Help”. <br>Try running the following two commands and see whether you get the same result:<br>Start-Process notepad<br>start notepad<br>Similarly, to stop this process, you can use either of the following commands:<br>Stop-Process -Name notepad<br>spps -Name notepad<br>To see all aliases, execute the Get-Alias cmdlet.<br><h4 id="pstopic-9"> -- Comments</h4><br>Leaving comments in a script will help you — and your colleagues — better understand what the script does. <br>A string comment is a single line that starts with a number sign (#), and block comments start and end with number signs and angle brackets and spread across multiple lines.<br><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PS11.png"><br><br><h4 id="pstopic-10"> -- Pipes</h4><br>A pipe passes data from one cmdlet to another. <br>I used a pipe earlier to get all properties of an object.<br>For example, if you execute the following script, you’ll get all services sorted by their status:<br>Get-Service | Sort-Object -property Status<br><br>You can also use a pipe to output text to a file using a script like the following:<br>"Hello, World!" | Out-File C:\ps\test.txt<br><br>You can use multiple pipes. <br>For instance, the following script lists all services, with the first pipe excluding stopped services and the second pipe limiting the list to display names only:<br>Get-Service | WHERE {$_.status -eq "Running"} | SELECT displayname<br># “$_.” defines current element in the pipe<br><br><h4 id="pstopic-11"> -- Summary</h4><br>Let’s quickly summarize the key points of this Windows PowerShell tutorial. <br>Now you know how to run PowerShell, how to change execution policy, what a cmdlet is, how to pass data using pipe and how to get object properties. <br>Keep in mind that if you forget something, you can always use the Get-Help cmdlet.<br>I hope you found this PowerShell for beginners useful!<br>In the next parts of this free PowerShell tutorial, I’ll cover <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2018/10/04/powershell-variables-and-arrays/">variables, arrays</a> and cycles, which are used in PowerShell scripting to simplify the administration of Windows Servers.<br>In the meantime, you might want to check out the following PowerShell scripts used by IT professionals to address specific

'<h2>Select a Theme and Build a User Profile</h2><br>The first thing I suggest doing is setting up the color theme for productive coding. <br>The default theme is "Dark Console, Light Editor" which is pleasant enough for starting off, but I prefer the "Dark Console, Dark Editor" theme to give code greater contrast and also emulate the natural PowerShell CLI. <br>To make this change, navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Colors and Fonts</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Themes</strong>. <br>This is also where you can tweak other colors if desired, but the font coloring is pretty decent out of the box.<br><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/powershell-options-color-dark.jpg"><br>While you\'re here, you can also toggle over to the General Settings tab to adjust the AutoSave interval. <br>It\'s set to 2 minutes by default, which I find to be enough to keep me honest, but you can adjust it up or down to suit your taste.<br>If you want to get fancier, I\'ve actually taken a shine to the <a href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&amp;id=1">Oblivion theme</a> on the <a href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/">Eclipse Color Themes</a> website. <br>While not usable in its native form, the XML file can be converted to a PowerShell ISE theme using a <a href="https://github.com/akawhoami/psisetheme">converter</a> provided by akawhoami on GitHub.<br><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ect-to-ise-converter.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ect-to-ise-converter.jpg"></a><br>To load an XML color theme, head back over to the PowerShell ISE <strong>Theme Manager</strong> from my earlier example and choose to import a theme file. <br>Oddly enough, there\'s no simple "import my theme" cmdlet. <br>You can set the colors once per workstation, bake in the specific color options in your profile, or use someone\'s <a href="https://lifeinpowershell.blogspot.com/2014/03/introducing-new-ise-color-theme-cmdlets.html">third party scripts</a>. <br>I don\'t mind doing it manually, or perhaps a reader will show me a better way. <br>🙂<br><h3>Presenting Code</h3><br>If you\'re going to present code on a projector screen, I\'d go back to a light background with dark text. <br>Because most projector screens are a white screen, it\'s not possible to make the background color truly dark &#8211; the projector simply projects "nothing" for black and you end up getting a funky washed out look.<br><h3>Build a User Profile</h3><br>A profile is a script that is called when PowerShell or PowerShell ISE opens. <br>Profile information can live in two locations:<br><br>Current User: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\<br>All Users: %WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\<br><br>Additionally, there are three types of profile files:<br><br>ISE and Console: profile.ps1<br>ISE only: Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1<br>Console only: Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1<br><br>Seems a tad overkill. <br>I personally select the current user path and drop in a profile.ps1, then just check for the $psISE variable to determine if the host is running the ISE. <br>Here\'s the path where it sits:<br><br>C:\Users\Chris.GLACIER\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1<br><br>My profile file is short and sweet, including a fun little message to myself for when I launch the ISE:<br><br>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass<br>Set-Location C:\Dropbox\Code<br>if ($psISE)<br>{<br>Start-Steroids<br>Clear-Host<br>Write-Host \'BEAST MODE (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻\'<br>}<br><br>This is a very simple profile. <br>Here\'s what it does:<br><br>Make sure the execution policy is effectively disabled (requires <em>Running as Administrator</em>)<br>Set the console location to my Dropbox\Code folder, because that\'s where I work on PowerShell code in most cases.<br>Test to see if the $psISE variable exists, meaning that I\'m launching the ISE. <br>If it does, I start ISESteroids and pump myself up with a little table throwing action.<br>If I\'m in the console, the logic test fails and nothing else happens.<br><br>Here\'s what a fresh ISE session looks like when loaded up:<br><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/launch-ise.jpg"><br>The PowerShell console is simpler.<br><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/launch-console.jpg"><br><h3>Run as Administrator</h3><br>I run both the ISE and Console as Administrator by changing the shortcut. <br>This avoids issues with the execution policy and gives me unfettered authority over the scripting editor. <br>Nothing more annoying than running into errors due to permissions on my own computer. <br>🙂<br>To do so, find the shortcut for PowerShell or PowerShell ISE, open the <strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Shortcut</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt; and check the <strong>Run as administrator</strong> box.<br><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wahlnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/run-as-admin-ise.jpg"><br><h3>Thoughts</h3><br>At this point I have what I consider to be a usable copy of PowerShell ISE at my disposal. <br>While it may look like a lot has happened, it isn\'t that much and only happens on a new system. <br>I have a master copy of the profile, colors, and portable modules that I clone to my workstations via Dropbox. <br>I\'m also a huge fan of <a href="http://www.powertheshell.com/isesteroids/">ISESteroids</a>, which I plan to go over in greater depth in the future.<br>',
