<br>
<div id="toc"></div></center>

<pre>
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. 
VPNs can be used to access region-restricted websites, shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.

These days VPNs are really popular, but not for the reasons they were originally created. 
They originally were just a way to connect business networks together securely over the internet or allow you to access a business network from home.

VPNs essentially forward all your network traffic to the network, which is where the benefits – like accessing local network resources remotely and bypassing Internet censorship – all come from. 
Most operating systems have integrated VPN support.

<h2>What Is a VPN and How Does It Help Me?</h2>
In very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer&#8217;s internet connection. 
So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn&#8217;t normally.

So how does this help you? Good question! You can use a VPN to:

Bypass geographic restrictions on websites or streaming audio and video.
Watch streaming media like Netflix and Hulu.
Protect yourself from snooping on untrustworthy Wi-Fi hotspots.
Gain at least some anonymity online by hiding your true location.
Protect yourself from being logged while torrenting.

The vast majority of people these days are using VPN for torrenting or bypassing geographic restrictions to watch content in a different country. 
They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that&#8217;s hardly the primary use anymore.

<h2>How Do You Get a VPN, and Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
Depending on your needs, you can either use a VPN from your workplace, create a VPN server yourself, or sometimes host one out of your house &#8212; but realistically the vast majority of people are just looking for something to protect them while torrenting or help them watch some media online that they can&#8217;t seem to access from their country.

The easiest thing to do is simply head to one of these sites, sign up, and download the VPN client for your Windows PC, Mac, Android, iPhone, or iPad. 
It&#8217;s as easy as that.


<strong><a href="https://www.linkev.com/?offer=3monthsfree&amp;a_fid=howtogeek&amp;data1=content&amp;data2=133680" rel="nofollow">ExpressVPN</a></strong> &#8211; This VPN server has the best combination of ease-of-use, really fast servers, and supports streaming media and torrenting, all for a cheap price.
<strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3607085-13718842?sid=ct133680" rel="nofollow">Tunnelbear</a></strong> &#8211; This VPN is really easy to use, is great for using at the coffee shop, and has a (limited) free tier. 
It&#8217;s not good for torrenting or streaming media though.
<strong><a href="https://strongvpn.com/?tr_aid=5aa96bb914566&amp;data1=content&amp;data2=133680" rel="nofollow">StrongVPN</a></strong> &#8211; not quite as easy to use as the others, but you can definitely use them for torrenting and streaming media.

All of them have free trials, so you can easily get your money back if you change your mind.

<h2>How Does a VPN Work?</h2>
When you connect your computer (or another device, such as a smartphone or tablet) to a VPN, the computer acts as if it’s on the same local network as the VPN. 
All your network traffic is sent over a secure connection to the VPN. 
Because your computer behaves as if it’s on the network, this allows you to securely access local network resources even when you’re on the other side of the world. 
You’ll also be able to use the Internet as if you were present at the VPN’s location, which has some benefits if you’re using pubic Wi-Fi or want to access geo-blocked websites.

When you browse the web while connected to a VPN, your computer contacts the website through the encrypted VPN connection. 
The VPN forwards the request for you and forwards the response from the website back through the secure connection. 
If you’re using a USA-based VPN to access Netflix, Netflix will see your connection as coming from within the USA.

<h2>Other Example Uses for VPNs</h2>
VPNs are a fairly simple tool, but they can be used to do a wide variety of things:

<ul>
<strong>Access a Business Network While Traveling</strong>: VPNs are frequently used by business travelers to access their business’ network, including all its local network resources, while on the road. 
The local resources don’t have to be exposed directly to the Internet, which increases security.
<strong>Access Your Home Network While Travelling</strong>: You can also set up your own VPN to access your own network while travelling. 
This will allow you to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/131961/how-to-access-windows-remote-desktop-over-the-internet/">access a Windows Remote Desktop over the Internet</a>, use local file shares, and play games over the Internet as if you were on the same LAN (local area network).
<strong>Hide Your Browsing Activity From Your Local Network and ISP</strong>: If you’re <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/26674/keep-your-windows-computer-secure-on-public-wireless-hotspots/">using a public Wi-Fi connection</a>, your browsing activity on non-HTTPS websites is visible to everyone neraby, if they know how to look. 
If you want to hide your browsing activity for a bit more privacy, you can connect to a VPN. 
The local network will only see a single, secure VPN connection. 
All the other traffic will travel over the VPN connection. 
While this can be used to bypass connection-monitoring by your Internet service provider, bear in mind that VPN providers may opt to log the traffic on their ends.
<strong>Access Geo-Blocked Websites</strong>: Whether you’re an American trying to access your Netflix account while travelling out of the country or you wish you could use American media sites like Netflix, Pandora, and Hulu, you’ll be able to access these region-restricted services if you connect to a VPN located in the USA.
<strong>Bypass Internet Censorship</strong>: Many Chinese people use VPNs to get around the Great Firewall of China and gain access to the entire Internet. 
(However, the Great Firewall has apparently started interfering with VPNs recently.)
<strong>Downloading Files</strong>: Yes, let’s be honest – many people use VPN connections to download files via <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33178/beginners-guide-to-bittorrent-protecting-your-privacy/">BitTorrent</a>. 
This can actually be useful even if you’re downloading completely legal torrents – if your ISP is throttling BitTorrent and making it extremely slow, you can use BitTorrent on a VPN to get faster speeds. 
The same is true for other types of traffic your ISP might interfere with (unless they interfere with VPN traffic itself.)
</ul>
<h2>Using a Corporate VPN in Windows</h2>
Connecting to a VPN is fairly simple. 
In Windows, press the Windows key, type VPN, and click the<em> Set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection </em>option. 
(If you use Windows 8, you’ll have to click the Settings category after searching.) Use the wizard to enter the address and login credentials of the VPN service you want to use. 
You can then connect to and disconnect from VPNs using the network icon in the system tray – the same one where you manage the Wi-Fi networks you’re connected to.

<h2>Our VPN Recommendations</h2>
If you’re just getting started with VPNs and want a basic VPN for using on public Wi-Fi hotspots or accessing region-restricted websites, there are a few good, simple options. 
We like <a href="https://www.linkev.com/?offer=3monthsfree&amp;a_aid=howtogeek&amp;data1=content&amp;data2=133680" rel="nofollow">ExpressVPN</a> because they have great speeds and a lot more functionality than average including clients for almost any device&#8212;you can even get a <a href="https://www.linkev.com/?offer=3monthsfree&amp;a_aid=howtogeek&amp;data1=content&amp;data2=133680" rel="nofollow">router pre-installed with their VPN client</a>.

There are other VPN products on the market, of course&#8212;we also like <a href="https://strongvpn.com/?tr_aid=5aa96bb914566&data1=content&data2=133680" rel="nofollow">StrongVPN</a> for all the configuration options it provides&#8212;and for limited use, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/ct396747/https://www.tunnelbear.com/pricing?sid=ct133680" rel="nofollow">Tunnelbear</a> has a free option limited to 500mb &#8212; which is great if you just need a client briefly.

<strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href='https://www.howtogeek.com/221929/how-to-choose-the-best-vpn-service-for-your-needs/'><strong><em>How to Choose the Best VPN Service for Your Needs</em></strong></a>

You may also be interested in setting up a VPN on your own server, which you can do with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/60774/connect-to-your-home-network-from-anywhere-with-openvpn-and-tomato/">Tomato</a>, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/64433/how-to-install-and-configure-openvpn-on-your-dd-wrt-router/">OpenWRT</a>, or <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/51237/setting-up-a-vpn-pptp-server-on-debian/">on Linux</a>. 
Of course, this won’t allow you to  access geo-blocked websites – unless you&#8217;re travelling outside the country and accessing your own network remotely.

<h2>VPN server in 15 minutes</h2>
People are (rightfully) freaking out about their privacy as the Senate <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/">voted</a> to let internet providers share your private data with advertisers. 
While it’s important to protect your privacy, it doesn’t mean that you should sign up to a VPN service and tunnel all your internet traffic through VPN servers.

<h2>A VPN doesn’t make you anonymous</h2>
What the hell is a VPN? I already wrote <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/wtf-is-a-vpn/">an article</a> explaining VPNs using simple concepts, even comparing VPNs to movie car chases.

But if you want a brief recap, when you connect your computer or phone to a VPN server, you establish an encrypted tunnel between your device and that server. 
Nobody can see what’s happening in the middle of this tunnel, not even your ISP.

And yet, it doesn’t make you magically anonymous. 
You’re just moving the risk down the VPN tunnel as the VPN company can see <em>all</em> your internet traffic. 
In fact, many of them sell your data to scammers and advertisers already.

That’s why I don’t recommend signing up to a VPN service. 
You can’t trust them.

As a side note, many sites now rely on HTTPS to establish a secure connection between your browser and the website you’re using, even TechCrunch. 
You should install the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE">HTTPS everywhere</a> extension to make sure that you use HTTPS as much as possible.

But VPNs can be useful from time to time. 
Sometimes you can’t access a website from a public network because it’s blocked. 
Or you could be traveling to China and you want to be able to access your Gmail account. 
In those cases, it’s all about minimizing the risk while you use a VPN.

<h2>Setting up your own VPN server</h2>
As Woz commented on my previous VPN article before the Senate debacle, you could be running your own VPN server:

But if you can’t trust your home connection or you have a slow upload speed on your home connection, it’s not really practical.

I played around with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">Algo VPN</a>, a set of scripts that let you set up a VPN in the cloud in very little time, even if you don’t know much about development. 
I’ve got to say that I was quite impressed with Trail of Bits’ approach.

I created VPN servers on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> server, an Amazon Web Services instance and a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaleway.com">Scaleway</a> server. 
I could connect to all these VPNs from my Mac and iPhone just a couple of minutes after that.

Algo VPN automates the VPN installation process so that you don’t have to establish an SSH connection with a server and run complicated command lines.

It takes three command lines to install the dependencies on your computer. 
After that, you should sign up to a cloud provider like DigitalOcean and run the Algo VPN setup wizard in your terminal. 
I&#8217;m not going to detail the installation process as it can change after I publish this post, but everything is explained on the official <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">GitHub repository</a>.

On DigitalOcean, you don’t have to create and configure your own server. 
Algo VPN takes care of that for you as it uses DigitalOcean’s API to create a server and install everything.

At the end of the setup wizard, you’ll get a few files on your local hard drive. 
For instance, on macOS, double-clicking on the configuration profile will add the VPN server to your network settings and connect you to your VPN server. 
You don’t need to install a VPN client, it works natively on macOS and iOS.

So here&#8217;s a quick recap:

<ol>
<li>Create an account on a cloud hosting provider like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo/archive/master.zip">Download</a> Algo VPN on your local computer, unzip it</li>
<li>Install the dependencies with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo#deploy-the-algo-server">command lines</a> on this page</li>
<li>Run the installation wizard</li>
<li>Double click on the configuration profiles in the configs directory</li>
</ol>
<h2>Disposable VPNs</h2>
Running your own VPN server doesn’t mean that you’ll be more secure on the internet, either. 
Once again, you’re moving the risk down the tunnel to the cloud hosting provider.

If you use Algo VPN on a Microsoft Azure instance, the NSA could still ask Microsoft more information about you if they think you’re an evil person. 
Microsoft has your billing information.

But there’s something refreshing about Algo VPN — it lets you set up disposable VPNs. 
You can boot up a new VPN server and connect to this VPN in just a few minutes. 
Once you’re done, you can just delete your instance and pretend that this VPN server never existed.

It’s much cheaper than subscribing to a VPN service, as you can expect to pay around $0.006 per hour of usage, or even less with free credit. 
And you’ll get much better performance as you won’t share your VPN server with other VPN users. 
I got amazing networking performances from my AWS VPN server for example:

<img src="https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/screen-shot-2017-04-07-at-7-18-01-pm.png">

While Algo VPN makes it easier to set up a VPN server on DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, I also tried using it with Scaleway to see if you could use it on any hosting provider. 
And it worked perfectly fine on the smallest Ubuntu cloud server.

If you have a bit of technical knowledge, I don’t see any reason why you should sign up to a commercial VPN service after playing with Algo VPN. 
I trust myself for not handing over my data to authorities (duh). 
I don’t necessarily trust the Amazons and Googles of the world to fight for my privacy, but I know they won&#8217;t sell my hosting data to third-party advertisers and scammers. 
I&#8217;m not so confident about my personal data on their consumer services, but that&#8217;s a topic for another article.

<h2>Windows 10 VPN Server和Client端連線</h2>

在手機和電腦中常見到「虛擬私有網路(VPN, Virtual Private Network)」，很多人可能也沒有實際的操作經驗，因此也不知道如何去用它。

而 VPN 要用在那裡？例如：你透過 VPN 連線來將你家裡的電腦認證為學校的電腦，你的電腦 IP 會被設定為學校網域中的 IP，因此你可以使用學校網址內的各種服務，像是學校圖書館鎖 IP 的各種服務，你在家也可以使用了。

你可以設著來練習架設 VPN Server 和 Client 的 VPN 連線，以建構完整的連線概念。
先做以下的準備工作：(本例以 Windows 10 系統的操作為例)
(1) 一部電腦當為 VPN 伺服器，必須能連線至網際網路，並須具備真實 IP(公開的 IP)。

(2) 一部電腦當為連線 VPN Client 端電腦，必須已經能連線至網際網路。

(3) VPN 連線所需的使用者名稱和密碼。

(4) 當為 VPN 伺服器者，必須持續開機，才能隨時連線。

&nbsp;
1. 建立 VPN Server
(1) 在 Windows 10 中按 WinKey+I 鍵，點選進入「網路和網際網路」。

(2) 切換至「乙太網路」項下，點選「變更介面卡選項」，進入「網路設定」視窗。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788869-3252178687.png">
(3) 按著 Alt 鍵，會出現功能表，然後點選[檔案／新增連入連線]選項。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788873-774640828.png">
(4) 接著要決定誰可以連線到這部電腦(VPN Server)，再按「下一步」。

點選已建立的帳戶，或是按下[新增使用者]來建立一個使用者，設定使用者名稱和密碼。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788874-675017966.png">
(5) 接著要勾選「透過網際網路」，再按「下一步」。

讓其他電腦可以透過網際網路連線到這部電腦使用這個VPN。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788875-2171753429.png">
(6) 選取「網際網路通訊協定第 4 版(TCP/IPv4)」，再點選「按鈕」。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788877-2354383858.png">
(7) 在 IP 內容中設定你要讓連線進入 VPN 的 IP 位址範圍。

注意：該 IP 位址必須要能使用，並且不會造成同網址中 IP 衝突者才可以。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788879-4884336.png">
(8) 關閉[連入 IP 內容]對話框後，接著要按「允許存取」按鈕。

(9) 留意一下電腦名稱的資訊，避免連錯電腦，按下「關閉」。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788880-3893334618.png">
(10) 最後，你會看列一個「連入連線」的設定，表示設定完成。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788882-305868462.png">
&nbsp;
2. 設定 VPN Client 端連線
(1) 在 Windows 10 中按 WinKey+I 鍵，點選進入「網路和網際網路」。

(2) 切換至「VPN」項下，點選「新增 VPN 連線」。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788884-969778375.png">
(3) 在[新增 VPN 連線]中設定：
VPN 提供者：Windows(內建)
連線名稱：自行設定一個名稱。

伺服器名稱或位址：設定你的 VPN Server 的真實 IP。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788885-3898391513.png">
VPN 類型：自動(預設)
登入資訊的類型：使用者名稱和密碼(預設)
<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788886-2575942663.png">
使用者名稱(選擇性)：輸入 VPN Server 已開放連線的帳戶名稱，也可以不用輸入。

密碼(選擇性)：輸入和上述帳號配對的密碼，如果已經輸入帳號，也可以不輸入密碼。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788887-1612662810.png">
(4) 按下「儲存」，結束 VPN Client 端的連線設定。

(5) 回到 VPN 頁面，點選剛剛設定的 VPN 連線名稱。

在此可以點選「連線」來進入登入 VPN Server 的動作，或是點選「移除」來刪除這個連線設定，必要時可以點選「進階選項」來進行細部的設定。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788888-2678741534.png">
每次要連線時，只要按下該頁面的「連線」，即可進行連線動作。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788889-1694918573.png">
或是在[網路連線]視窗中點選你建立的 VPN 連線。

<img src="https://pic.pimg.tw/isvincent/1444788890-2053567117.png">
或是點選在狀態列上的「網際網路存取」圖示，可以再點選已設定的 VPN 連線。
