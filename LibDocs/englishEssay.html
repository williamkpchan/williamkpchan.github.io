'<h2>I\'m Quitting Quora</h2><br><br>It comes with deep regret that I inform my most beloved readers and friends, that I will no longer be able to write on Quora, as of today.<br><br>I know that this may come as a surprise to many, as I\'ve spent so much of the last decade immersed in a mission to help educate a world on viewpoints and perspectives many have no access to. <br>But, there comes a time where a writer simply must come to realities that it is time to put down the quill.<br><br>I promise you, this isn\'t a rant or a rage quit. <br>We\'ve seen too many writers of the past leave us like that. <br>This isn\'t some self-righteous protest. <br>It isn\'t that I\'m upset about some beloved feature broken or taken away. <br>It isn\'t an issue with moderation or from the attacks of people who despise my very being. <br>Though this news may come as great news to many, I didn\'t do it because of them. <br>This is something that has been weighing on me heavily for a long time, and I\'ve finally decided… now is the time.<br><br>But, you\'re all owed an explanation.<br><br>The truth is, I\'m in this for the money. <br>I\'m a capitalist mercenary. <br>Pure and simple. <br>You\'ve all known this from the way I shamelessly panhandle my Patreon page in nearly any post I can.<br><br><br>I\'ve only ever written so that I would get paid. <br>A guy has to eat, right? And I have kids. <br>Well, one kid. <br>Okay, one kid, and a sheltie, but she is a really fat sheltie is all I\'m saying. <br>We all need money.<br><br>It\'s true what they said about me — I\'ve only ever been about this for the money. <br>The countless hours I spent plugging away at the keyboard? That wasn\'t to share knowledge, or to help people better understand each other and the world. <br>Honestly, I don\'t care about that at all. <br>It\'s all just been about swimming in that sea of green, baby. <br>Yeah, y\'all know what I mean. <br>Benjamins.<br><br>But I\'ve come to realize that my talents here on Quora are wasted. <br>There are much, much better uses of what I can do to give my family the lifestyle they deserve.<br><br>That\'s why I\'m quitting writing and taking on a new profession:<br><br>Thanks everyone, for everything. <br>With great thanks for all the years of love and support and looking forward to my next journey.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Jon Davis<br>',
