'<h2><span class="orange">The Ascent of Money</span></h2><br>JOANNE MYERS: Good morning. <br>I\'m Joanne Myers. <br>On behalf of the Carnegie Council, I\'d like to thank you all for joining us. <br>During my tenure at the Carnegie Council, I have had the privilege of introducing many speakers. <br>I know you will agree that most of them have been very stimulating, fascinating in what they have to say, and, for the most part, very smart. <br>Even so, there are always a few who, in my opinion, stand out from all the rest. <br>This morning it is my pleasure to welcome back one such individual, one of my favorite recidivists, Niall Ferguson. <br>In the past, Niall has spoken to us about empire, diplomacy, warfare, and globalization. <br>Today he will be discussing a topic on everyone\'s mind, the financial crisis. <br>His book, The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World, will provide a background and an understanding for many of the critical problems we are now facing on Wall Street and beyond. <br>For anyone who has read his earlier books or has taken the time to read his impressive bio that was handed out to you earlier, there is no denying that you have learned a great deal from this exceptionally formidable historian. <br>The bottom line is that this morning you can bank on knowing that you will leave here with much more knowledge from someone who has never passed the buck in his talks here. <br>Although he may not be made out of money, as you will see, he is worth his weight in gold. <br>When I began writing this introduction, it occurred to me how often the word "money" and references to it not only have entered our everyday vocabulary, but have permeated our culture as well. <br>For example, over and over I kept seeing Joel Grey in Cabaret performing "Money, Money, Money Makes the World Go Around, Makes the World Go Around." When that stopped playing in my head, I heard the character Fagin in Oliver! singing, "In this life, one thing counts, in the bank, large amounts." One thing led to another, and then I began thinking about the Watergate debacle, where the modus operandi was, "Follow the money." Next I had visions of Cuba Gooding, who, in the movie Jerry Maguire, shouted, "Show me the money." Finally, I had enough when I heard Michael Douglas, when playing Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street, speak the line that epitomized the late 1980s and has now once again become emblematic of our time: "Greed is good." I could go on and on, but I think you have the idea. <br>As I suspect, many of you in this time of financial crisis can conjure up your own associations to the power and fascination that the word "money" evokes. <br>But before you do, I just wonder how many of you are familiar with this subject\'s complex history and have thought about the centrality of finance to all elements of human progress. <br>In The Ascent of Money, Niall takes us on a very special historical journey. <br>Although his recent books have been mostly about the decline of empires, financial history is his specialty, as evidenced by his earlier writing, The Cash Nexus and The House of Rothschild. <br>With his signature clarity, verve, and eloquence, this time around he shows us just how vital finance is to the history of the world. <br>He asks, how did we come to live in a world where most money is invisible? Where did money come from, and where did it go? As he charts the rise of money from 5,000 years ago to the numbers we see flickering on the big board on Wall Street, he engages and entertains, as he reminds us just how much money represents a relationship of trust and how the development of money has gone hand in hand with the development of modern societies. <br>He explains the origin and growth of money, banks, stock markets, the exotic growth of the financial instruments and institutions that even bewilder those in the field. <br>With his extraordinary ability to link the past with the present, Niall tells us, if we want money to serve us in the future, it is important to attend to the ways it has served us in the past. <br>I believe a reading of The Ascent of Money can do just that. <br>In these dire financial times, it should be self-evident that we need someone or something that can put today\'s crisis into context and suggest to us what can be done in the future. <br>In my humblest opinion, that someone is here, with that something that can make all the difference, our speaker, the man with the Midas touch, Niall Ferguson. <br>Remarks NIALL FERGUSON: The best things in life are free, ladies and gentlemen. <br>Joanne, you\'re not free, but you\'re certainly one of the best things in life. <br>Thank you so much for that very generous introduction. <br>It\'s a huge pleasure to be back here, I think some two years since my last visit. <br>Two years ago, I talked about my book The War of the World, which was an explanation！I think an explanation！of mid-20th- century conflicts. <br>One of the arguments that I made was that there are three things that determine the timing and location of extreme, organized, lethal violence in mid-20th century: empires in decline (that¨s a subject I have written about in other places), ethnic disintegration, and economic volatility. <br>Two years ago, I was able to say we may have one and we may have two, but, fortunately, we don\'t have three yet. <br>At that time, I was also quite regularly speaking at meetings organized by investment banks. <br>You remember what they were, don\'t you? The theme of my talks in mid-2006 and early 2007 was the possibility, indeed the probability, of a liquidity crisis striking highly leveraged financial institutions and causing the kind of financial crisis that hadn\'t been seen in more than a generation. <br>I wrote a number of pieces and gave a number of talks on this theme. <br>What most impressed me was the extreme reluctance of anybody in the financial world to take this scenario seriously. <br>At that time, two years ago, the conventional wisdom on Wall Street and in the City of London was that we were living through what Ben Bernanke called the "Great Moderation," the death of volatility. <br>Risk had been allocated to those best able to bear it. <br>This time, it really was different. <br>My approach to the problem was to say, "Financial history will prove you wrong. <br>You only believe this because you are basing your assessment on your own experience. <br>And that is too small a data set. <br>Even if you\'ve had 25 years on Wall Street, you cannot imagine what it might be like if a really big liquidity crisis struck." The Ascent of Money is an attempt to provide context for this crisis. <br>It was written in anticipation of the crisis. <br>I hope that, for those of you baffled or at least somewhat disconcerted by what is happening, it will offer some illumination. <br>It is a lay person\'s guide to the international financial system, written on the assumption that you can\'t really understand something until you know where it came from. <br>There\'s only one equation in the whole book, and it\'s there to be ridiculed. <br>What I want to do this morning is not talk through the argument of the book, but rather, because of the nature of this audience, to explore its geopolitical implications. <br>What does it mean when a subprime mortgage crisis！that is to say, a crisis in the mortgage market for relatively poor Americans！precipitates a credit crunch！that is to say, a major breakdown in trust between financial institutions and a seizure within the credit market！which in turn begets a global financial crisis comparable in its magnitude to the worst recession of the postwar period, perhaps even comparable！who knows?！with the Great Depression? What does that mean? There are a number of arguments out there that are relevant here. <br>My friend Fareed Zakaria is riding high on the bestseller list with a book called The Post-American World. <br>Does this accelerate the transition to a post-American world? Many people seem to think so. <br>This, after all, is a financial crisis made in America. <br>"One thing seems probable to me"！and I\'m quoting here Peer Steinbr┨ck, the German finance minister, only a month or so ago！"the U.S. <br>will lose its status as the superpower of the global financial system." Here\'s a headline from The New York Times last month: "A Power That May Not Stay So Super," the United States. <br>"A Shattering Moment in America\'s Fall from Power." That was The Guardian. <br>"The End of Hubris," Der Spiegel. <br>It is fast becoming conventional wisdom in the Western media！and one also hears it argued in Asia, too (I have just returned from a trip to Singapore)！that this crisis implies an acceleration of the decline and fall of the American Empire. <br>Richard Holbrooke only the other day published an article in Foreign Affairs in which he argued！and I quote！"There is one pattern that comes very close to being a law of history. <br>In the long run, the rise and fall of great nations is driven primarily by their economic strength. <br>Rome, Imperial China, Venice, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, all had their day, and their international decline followed inexorably from their economic decline." This, of course, is the legacy of Paul Kennedy\'s great book, The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, a book that I very much admire but have had occasion to disagree with over the years. <br>Now, you might expect me to be attracted to this argument, particularly if you read my book Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire, the last chapter of which suggested！this was published back in 2004！that the principal vulnerability of the United States was not imperial overstretch, excessive military commitments abroad (which, you will recall, was Paul Kennedy\'s argument in 1987), but was internal indebtedness. <br>The fiscal deficit, the current account deficit, I suggested in 2004, was among the three deficits that were likely to undermine the American Empire. <br>You will remember that the other deficits were the manpower deficit！the chronic inability of Americans to export people, which is a major problem if you are trying to run a global empire！and, of course, the attention deficit, which has plagued all American interventions overseas, with a very few exceptions. <br>However, I\'m going to argue somewhat paradoxically this morning that the credit crunch, global financial crisis, or Great Depression！whatever you feel like calling it！this great economic shock does not necessarily reduce the power of the United States. <br>It may, in fact, have the opposite effect, for the simple reason that power is relative. <br>Let me explore this argument a little bit more closely. <br>The first point I want to make to you is that the wrong question is to ask if this represents a decline of the American Empire or of American superpower. <br>What we should really ask is whether this crisis portends a decline of what I call "Chimerica." Chimerica is a fantasy country that I dreamt up a couple of years ago. <br>It\'s the economy you get when you add together China plus America. <br>Chimerica has been, in many ways, the key to the way in which the world economy has worked in the past ten years. <br>Increasingly, the U.S. <br>current account deficit, which peaked at around 1 percent of global output, has been financed by the People\'s Bank of China！not exclusively. <br>The Bank of Japan has done some. <br>So have the oil exporters. <br>There have been a number of surplus countries that have helped to contribute to this financing of the American deficit. <br>But China has become, in many ways, the key. <br>My argument is that you can\'t really understand what happened in the global economy in the last ten years if you don\'t understand Chimerica. <br>It seemed like the perfect marriage: One partner did the saving and the other partner did the spending. <br>You may know couples like that. <br>The Chinese saved; the Americans spent. <br>For the Chinese, this was advantageous. <br>They had an export market that they could rely upon. <br>From the United States\' point of view, this was a line of credit at remarkably low interest rates. <br>When ten-year Treasuries were trading at 3.5 percent, the United States was able to borrow at historically low rates, despite the fact that its borrowings kept going up and up and up. <br>Call it the "age of leverage." We have lived through an age of leverage in which the ratio of debt to GDP in the United States, including all forms of debt, public and private, has risen from about 150 percent to 355 percent. <br>You can\'t understand the consumption boom of the last six or seven years, and you certainly can\'t understand the great leveraging of the last decade or so, if you don\'t understand Chimerica. <br>It was only possible because of what Ben Bernanke called "the Asian savings glut." So the big question is whether the financial crisis that began in August of last year threatens Chimerica. <br>If it disrupts the relationship between the United States and the great capital exporting economies！in particular, China！then we have a very serious problem indeed. <br>But I\'m not entirely sure that it will. <br>Let me tell you why. <br>Before I explore this, let\'s reflect for a second on how this crisis unfolded. <br>It\'s worth pondering. <br>It began with the breakdown of a bubble, the deflation of a real estate bubble, in the United States. <br>Property prices were rising at an annual rate, at the maximum point, of nearly 20 percent a year. <br>This was a classic bubble, and the second bubble we have seen within a little more than a decade！the stock market bubble of the late 1990s, followed by the real estate bubble of the recent 2000s. <br>As property prices began to fall！and they are now falling at a faster rate than at any time since the early 1930s！monetary policy dived into action, diving downward in terms of the federal funds rate and leaping upwards in terms of the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve. <br>Currently, the Fed\'s various liquidity operations total in excess of $1.7 trillion. <br>Its balance sheet now exceeds $2 trillion. <br>It may come as a surprise to you to know that, in effect, the Fed has become a hedge fund, leveraged at roughly 50 to 1. <br>That\'s the ratio of its assets to its capital. <br>So this is now one of the world\'s biggest and, it seems to me, riskiest hedge funds. <br>It wasn\'t enough. <br>Not only did the United States slash interest rates and pump trillions of dollars into the financial system, it also has embarked on a public borrowing spree, as the U.S. <br>Treasury has leapt into action with TARP, the Troubled Asset Recovery Program, and other stimulus packages no doubt to proliferate in the months ahead. <br>Where have we got to? I call it the "Great Repression." It\'s the Great Repression because we are repressing a banking crisis comparable in magnitude with that of the early 1930s. <br>We are, in some measure, in denial about the magnitude of this crisis. <br>I\'m constantly meeting people who say, "The bottom of the market will be tomorrow." the United States, followed by a period of very slow growth, conceivably running for five years or more. <br>Why do I think that? If the end of leverage is upon us, if the age of leverage is at an end, and debt is no longer going to be readily available to financial institutions and to households, then we are bound to have much lower growth. <br>Deleveraging means precisely that. <br>If you take out mortgage equity withdrawal from the story of the period 2001 to 2007, take it out from the growth numbers, you find that growth under President George W. <br>Bush would have averaged 1 percent a year. <br>It was mortgage equity withdrawal that kept consumption going, and nothing else. <br>So 1 percent per annum may, in fact, be the natural growth rate of the United States, in the absence of leverage. <br>But what does this mean geopolitically? Does this fundamentally alter the relationship between the United States and the rest of the world? That seems to me to be the big question. <br>If the United States is turning Japanese, if it\'s about to experience what Japan experienced in the 1990s！zero interest rates, an explosion in public debt, but！oh dear, Keynesianism doesn\'t really work！very low growth, perhaps even no growth, over the decade！does that portend an acceleration of the decline of the United States? There are three reasons why it\'s plausible to think that it does, three reasons that I hear people put forward when they are claiming that this is the end of American superpower. <br>One is just that this represents a loss of credibility. <br>The Washington Consensus is dead. <br>The American model of deregulated financial markets has been discredited, literally. <br>This, I suppose, is an argument most commonly made in Western Europe. <br>The second argument that one hears is that this will accelerate what is sometimes called the "great reconvergence." That is to say, it will accelerate the closing of the gap between the United States and the big, rapidly industrializing countries, the BRICs！Brazil, Russia, India, and particularly China. <br>Goldman Sachs some years ago, under the direction of their excellent Mancunian economist, Jim O\'Neill, produced a report, the BRICs report, that forecast that China\'s gross domestic product would equal that of the United States in around 2040. <br>A few years ago！I think two years ago！O\'Neill and his colleagues revised their projections of growth and concluded that the sorpasso, to use an Italian term, the moment at which China overtakes the United States, could come as soon as 2027. <br>Is it not reasonable, therefore, to assume that the credit crunch, that the financial crisis, will bring that date still nearer? If the United States is condemned to a decade of 1 percent per annum growth and China can still manage, let us say, conservatively, 6 or 7 percent per annum growth, could the sorpasso come as soon as 2020 or 2019, perhaps within a decade? It seems a reasonable probability, if you believe that growth rates can be projected forward in that kind of way. <br>A third possibility which is worth exploring, a third reason why the United States might be in serious trouble, is the idea that the dollar is going to lose its status as the reserve currency. <br>It has been crucial for the United States that it has been able to borrow in the international reserve currency, because it has given it an advantage over other sovereign borrowers. <br>But history tells us a very simple story, particularly British history. <br>No reserve currency lasts forever. <br>A hundred years ago, the pound was the principal international reserve currency. <br>Its painful decline and fall from close to $5.00 at one time to the nadir of near-parity in the early 1980s！that is a story of the decline and fall of a reserve currency. <br>It could happen to a currency near you. <br>So these are the three arguments that I hear that have some substance to them: (1) This is a crisis that discredits the United States as a purveyor of economic ideology. <br>(3) It\'s a crisis that threatens the status of the dollar as a reserve currency. <br>Well, I want to suggest to you six reasons why this may not, in fact, work out the way the forecasts of decline anticipate！six arguments, if you like, against American suicide, or at least against American depression. <br>The first point to notice is that for the United States to contend with a financial crisis on this scale is fiscally possible. <br>That is to say, even a $2-trillion deficit！let\'s assume the worst, the largest imaginable deficit in peacetime next year, to finance not only the bailout, but also an enormous stimulus package！this can be financed, it seems to me, because the debt-to-GDP ratio of the United States is by no means the highest in the world as things stand. <br>If you include only that debt which is in public hands, as opposed to in the hands of government agencies, it\'s still less than 50 percent of GDP. <br>An addition of another, let\'s say, ten percent of GDP is conceivably affordable. <br>It\'s affordable, but there is a caveat: Assuming the rest of the world is willing to absorb a continued, indeed accelerated, issuance of American government debt. <br>The second and, in many ways, crucial point is that it\'s all relative. <br>It\'s relatively easier for the United States to finance this kind of a deficit than it is for European countries. <br>What is not generally acknowledged here or in Europe is that the crisis is worse for Europe than for the United States. <br>Why is that? First, it\'s because the banking problems that we have seen in this country are mirrored on the other side of the Atlantic. <br>Indeed, leverage is higher in many European countries\' banking systems than it is here！much higher in the case, for example, of Germany. <br>It comes as something of a surprise to realize the extent to which the Europeans currently pointing fingers at the United States have been guilty of exactly the same excesses in their financial markets as went on here. <br>Indeed, in a country like Britain, the degree of imbalance between finance and the rest of the economy is far, far greater than here. <br>It has to be said！and I apologize to any of my countrymen and countrywomen here！that from a purely financial point of view, Great Britain is close to being "Great Iceland." The Icelandic story of an excessively large financial system in relation to an underlying economy is, in fact, quite closely paralleled but on a larger scale in the United Kingdom at this point. <br>Switzerland, too, has an Icelandic character！an enormous financial system relative to the underlying economy. <br>It\'s much harder for the Europeans to contend with this crisis because not only are these very large financial systems in, arguably, worse shape than the American banking system, there is also no European treasury that can finance a $700-billion bailout. <br>Right now each European country is having to tackle its financial crisis on its own. <br>National treasuries, national financial ministries are coping with this crisis！or, rather, not coping with this crisis. <br>So that\'s the second point. <br>It\'s not really appreciated how big a problem this is for the Eurozone, and indeed for the wider European Union. <br>The third point is that those famous BRICs！Brazil, Russia, India, China！turn out to have been aptly named, because they are dropping like bricks. <br>If you look at equity markets, although it\'s unquestionably the case that this is one of the worst bear markets in the United States in living memory, the stock exchanges of the BRICs have fallen twice as far as the S&P 500 in the year to date, with Russia the worst performer and China and India not far behind. <br>hypothesis. <br>(I always find that word "decoupling" faintly obscene, but that\'s possibly because I have a puerile mind.) But let\'s simply assume the thesis that China can walk away from this financial crisis unscathed and continue to maintain a growth rate of at least 6 or 7 percent. <br>That is the hypothesis of the great reconvergence. <br>I\'m not persuaded. <br>I\'m not persuaded that China is so much less dependent on export markets than it was, say, 10 years ago. <br>Many of the calculations that imply that seem to me to be based on official estimates of the importance of net exports that aren\'t wholly plausible. <br>The BRICs are dropping, in other words. <br>It\'s by no means certain that they can avoid a kind of asymmetric shock as the export markets of the developed world suddenly contract. <br>My fourth point is that the great crisis is terrible news for the petro-powers. <br>Remember, some of the biggest thorns in the side of the United States are energy exporters！Russia, Venezuela, and, of course, Iran. <br>The great credit crunch spells the end of the commodity-price boom that peaked in the early part of this year. <br>As the price of natural gas, and particularly of oil, zooms downward！I think quite likely to below $50 a barrel, maybe to as low as $25 a barrel！it\'s game-over for the petro-powers. <br>It doesn\'t take much for Venezuela¨s financial system to teeter on the brink. <br>In fact, as soon as oil fell below $95 a barrel, the finances of Venezuela began to look very problematic. <br>For the other petro-powers, the price barrier is a little lower, but not that much lower. <br>Again, it\'s all relative. <br>It\'s all relative. <br>But in the end, the relative shock of a great recession, if not a great depression, is greater for energy exporters than for the energy importers, who, in fact, get a kind of stimulus, a kind of tax cut at the gasoline pump. <br>Let me make two more points and then conclude. <br>The penultimate is that, while our attention has been diverted to the financial crisis, so diverted that the economy became the issue, the one and only issue, in the presidential campaign that culminated on November 4, other problems that used to preoccupy us have become significantly less serious. <br>The situation in the Middle East is significantly better, in my view, than it was two years ago, not least because of the success of the surge in Iraq in achieving some stabilization of that country\'s security and laying the foundation for an agreement between the Iraqi government and the United States on the future status of American forces in that country！a major breakthrough, which goes to show, of course, that in politics no good deed goes unpunished. <br>His correctness about the surge did not help John McCain in the presidential election. <br>He was right about it and his opponent was, in fact, wrong. <br>But success took Iraq off the electoral agenda. <br>Indeed, the modest success, I would say, of the Annapolis process has also taken the Middle East off the political agenda. <br>But the success doesn\'t seem to me to be any the less, despite its lack of political salience. <br>I think the critical point, though, is the potential that now exists for some kind of breakthrough in relations between the United States and Iran. <br>To me, the most significant part of those presidential debates by far came in the second debate, when the two candidates found themselves arguing about what Henry Kissinger had said on the subject of talks without preconditions with Iran. <br>I found that fascinating, that a man who has been out of government for three decades should be still regarded as the fountainhead of wisdom on the front that we call the Middle Eastern peace process. <br>I foresee under the new president a breakthrough in relations with Iran, because the Iranians desperately need it and the United States has something it can offer. <br>I foresee a Nixon-in-China moment, Obama- in-Tehran, that will fundamentally alter the situation in the Greater Middle East. <br>This is a huge opportunity, there for the taking for the new administration. <br>all the hotspots in the world. <br>Which leaves me with just one final point: Is it all over for Chimerica? That\'s the key, really. <br>Currently, the plans being implemented in Washington for a bailout and a stimulus package that will take the deficit well north of $1 trillion next year are predicated on the idea that the rest of the world, and particularly China, will continue to finance that deficit. <br>It certainly can\'t be financed domestically, because the savings simply aren\'t there. <br>Now, will the Chinese do it or not? Will they continue to be buyers of U.S. <br>Treasuries, as they have been for the past five or six years, or not? The possibility exists that they will switch their resources to domestic expansion, to domestic consumption. <br>That seems to be one of the implications of their own stimulus package, which is around about $586 billion worth of stimulus, a very large proportion of Chinese GDP, about 15 percent. <br>But I don\'t think it\'s absolutely certain. <br>In fact, I have deep doubts that the Chinese are really able to walk away from their Chimerican relationship. <br>That is because the export sector remains absolutely crucial to China\'s economy, and the Chinese themselves have been shocked at the damage that has already been done to that sector by the global slowdown. <br>It seems likely that they have reversed their policy of allowing the Chinese currency gently to appreciate relative to the dollar. <br>In fact, I would anticipate an increase of intervention by the People\'s Bank of China to halt, and maybe even to reverse, renminbi appreciation. <br>That is very crucial indeed, because it means they become committed to the accumulation of yet more dollar reserves. <br>News just in: Last month the Japanese were net sellers of Treasuries, to the tune of nearly $13 billion, but the Chinese were net buyers, to the tune of nearly $50 billion！just last month. <br>So their actions seem to me to be speaking rather louder than their words. <br>I don\'t see the Chinese walking away from Chimerica. <br>They have too much skin in this game. <br>Did you realize that roughly a fifth of their currency reserves were in the form of the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? If you want a reason for why those institutions were bailed out the way they were, look to Beijing, not to Washington. <br>The Chinese stand to lose more than anybody else from a dollar rout. <br>If the dollar ceases to be a reserve currency and depreciates drastically against Asian currencies, the Chinese will be hurt more than anyone, which is why I think it\'s highly unlikely that they will let it go. <br>For all these reasons, it seems to me that, as Churchill, I think it was, once said, "God continues to look after not only fools and drunks, but also the United States." A crisis made in America is having greater repercussions and causing greater pain in the rest of the world than in the United States itself. <br>Yes, the United States is heading for a decade of slow growth. <br>But the pain may be greater in the rest of the world, including, my view, the BRICs. <br>And since all power is relative, that may imply！and this is the supreme paradox！that this crisis enhances the power of the United States and indeed increases the demand in the rest of the world for American economic and geopolitical leadership. <br>This is the strange kind of opportunity that arises when a new and charismatic president is elected in the heat of a financial crisis. <br>This is a little bit like getting Roosevelt in 1931 rather than 1933. <br>There is a catch. <br>As I have said before, it all hinges on the bond market and China\'s commitment to it. <br>As I have said, I think the Chinese will stay committed, but there\'s a possibility that they won\'t. <br>There\'s a possibility that they will opt for what you might call market socialism in one country. <br>On the 1930s model, we may yet see the last great Communist power going its own way and walking away from the great depression, having almost no involvement in it. <br>That, after all, was the Soviet experience in the 1930s. <br>Watch the bond market, ladies and gentlemen, in the first 100 days of President Obama\'s administration, and remember the wise words of James Carville, campaign manager to Bill Clinton, back in February 1993！one of my favorite quotations from that era: "I used to think if there was reincarnation," Carville hitter. <br>But now I want to come back as the bond market: You can intimidate everybody." Thank you very much indeed. <br>JOANNE MYERS: As anticipated, that was wonderful. <br>I would say, don\'t invest in the stock market, but invest in The Ascent of Money. <br>NIALL FERGUSON: It will appreciate in value, I promise. <br>JOANNE MYERS: I would like to open the floor to questions. <br>Questions and Answers QUESTION: Niall, after that global exposition, it\'s hard to think of a question that doesn\'t sound petty and nationalistic, but here I go. <br>Would you give us your judgment on the deregulation-regulation argument in this country? How responsible, if at all, was deregulation for what happened? Can you imagine a new regulation kind of regime that would prevent it from happening again? NIALL FERGUSON: I think one of the great fallacies of current debate is that there\'s somehow a choice between regulation and no regulation, and it was deregulation that caused the crisis, and if only we had kept the regulations, the crisis wouldn\'t have happened. <br>I don\'t buy this at all. <br>There\'s no such thing as a regulation-free financial market. <br>All markets are regulated. <br>The question is simply whether the regulations work or not. <br>The biggest case of deregulation in the past decade was the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, that act from the 1930s that divided investment banking from commercial banking. <br>That has done absolutely nothing to cause this crisis. <br>Not a single thing that happened that caused the crisis was made more likely by the repeal of that act. <br>In effect, the separation of investment banks from commercial banks continued, regardless of the repeal. <br>What you can, I think, say is that there was negligence！and here I think I would shift the emphasis from regulation to monetary policy！there was negligence on the part of the Fed and there was negligence on the part of the SEC. <br>Let me specify just what I mean by that. <br>First, I think the doctrine that the Fed should only look at core inflation when making decisions about monetary policy was a false doctrine. <br>Alan Greenspan\'s argument that asset price bubbles were not his problem will, I think, go down in history as one of the great mistakes of modern financial history. <br>The other key issue, which seems to me to be crucial here, has to do with bank leverage. <br>It was the decision to allow the investment banks a free run at expanding their balance sheets in relation to their capital！a decision that was taken quite informally at the SEC, with virtually no headlines！that paved the way to the excesses of the age of leverage. <br>We have seen a basic failure in the way in which bank capital adequacy is regulated. <br>Basel I, Basel II, those supposedly voluntary accords, failed to create discipline. <br>They were not strict enough as regulations. <br>They were not binding enough on national governments, both in Europe and in the United States. <br>That was the great mistake, actually. <br>So I would emphasize more the way in which the regulations were enforced than the regulations themselves. <br>There were regulations！Basel I and Basel II specified them！about bank capital adequacy, but they were not enforced. <br>If anything has to change, it seems to me it\'s there. <br>We do need some kind of more binding international regime to govern bank capital adequacy. <br>If that emerges from the G-20 summit in April, I will be very pleased indeed. <br>QUESTION: Niall, thank you very much. <br>I want to ask you a question about the implications of your thesis for United States foreign policy. <br>It seems to me that if you are right, everybody in the world actually has a very strong interest, in terms of stability, in the fact that China does continue its commitment to the U.S. <br>bond market. <br>But what does the United States need to do in order to encourage China to take that position? To what extent will the foreign policy options of the United States influence those Chinese decisions? NIALL FERGUSON: Thank you. <br>That\'s an excellent question. <br>It seemed to me for more than a year that a great deal more effort needed to be made by the U.S. <br>Treasury to conciliate the Chinese and to encourage them to feel invested in American financial stability. <br>About a year ago, I wrote a piece for the Financial Times in which I argued that a global bailout was conceivable in which the sovereign wealth funds, including that of China, and central banks of the great surplus countries could be mobilized to recapitalize the Western banking system. <br>This was a lost opportunity. <br>In fact, only very small amounts of money were invested, for example, in Morgan Stanley by the Chinese sovereign wealth fund. <br>When those investments went bad, the Chinese and others, including the Gulf states, pulled back. <br>Given that it was obvious the banks needed to be recapitalized, that was a huge lost opportunity. <br>Hank Paulson should have been down on bended knee in Beijing pressing the Chinese to make a much larger commitment to Western financial institutions and offering some kind of floor below which the stock price of Morgan Stanley would not fall. <br>The global bailout could have happened, and it would have been a far more rational bailout than the one we are currently seeing. <br>But we are getting to a global bailout by a roundabout means. <br>Instead of selling them bank equity, we are going to sell them bonds and use the proceeds to recapitalize the banks, as it were, indirectly. <br>What I don\'t know is whether it\'s appreciated sufficiently in Washington and in Beijing that this is the key. <br>We have two ways out of the global imbalances the world currently faces. <br>In one benign scenario, Chinese imports increase and American exports increase. <br>That can be achieved through coordinated expansion. <br>But it won\'t happen spontaneously. <br>It won\'t happen if each national government narrowly pursues its own interests, which is what is happening now. <br>The other way it can happen is if Chinese exports collapse and American imports collapse. <br>That\'s the painful way in which the imbalances disappear. <br>That, it seems to me, is the Great Depression scenario. <br>So from an American diplomacy\'s point of view, it is crucial that there be a meeting, not of the G-20！far too many people around the table！but of the G-2. <br>I\'ve been urging that the G-2！that is to say, the Chimerican duo, China and America！get together and think of this in global terms. <br>We shouldn\'t blow the dust off Keynes and think we can solve this problem in a narrowly national way. <br>This requires a globally coordinated effort to reduce imbalances gradually, and it will only happen through diplomatic channels. <br>Right now I don\'t see much traffic in those channels. <br>The nightmare, of course, is the headline which I have been imagining for some time: "China Calls Meeting of G-1 in Beijing." QUESTION: Personal consumption has accounted for some 70 percent of the American GNP and it\'s evaporating. <br>Would not a massive infrastructure program be the logical short- and intermediate-term response to jumpstarting the American economy and bringing it back on track? NIALL FERGUSON: This, I think, is the Keynesian argument. <br>Paul Krugman is one of those who currently makes it. <br>With all due respect to the Nobel laureate！and indeed to you, sir！this is to overlook the fact of globalization. <br>Keynes\'s remedies in The General Theory (which I know, because I read it three times as an undergraduate trying to understand it) are very clear. <br>It works best in a relatively closed economy. <br>Keynes acknowledged this in the foreword to the German edition of The General Theory, in which he If we embark on a grand infrastructure-building program, and thereby swell the deficit still further ！remember, we already have $1 trillion in the pipeline from the bailout and associated measures already taken！we are essentially making a call on the global bond market. <br>This is not a Keynesian solution at all. <br>The stimulus will have repercussions internationally, not only in the bond market, but in the currency markets. <br>That is why it is naive to imagine that we can simply do this. <br>As I\'ve said, you need to think of this as one economy, Chimerica, and remember that any measures taken here will have knock-on effects in the wider world. <br>I\'m not wholly against the idea of infrastructure investment. <br>There\'s no doubt, as one walks around and drives around the United States, that one can see room for improvement. <br>I\'m also sympathetic to the idea that some of the investment be directed at renewable energy technologies, at weaning the United States off its dependence on fossil fuels. <br>But we have to make sure that the deficit that we are running makes sense internationally. <br>If it\'s not credible, if we overdo it and make too big a demand on the Chinese, then we risk unleashing a bond market rout and a dollar rout. <br>That seems to me to be insufficiently appreciated by the neo-Keynesians. <br>You know, one of the depressing things about all of this is the bankruptcy it reveals of economics as a discipline. <br>The economists in this country are some of the cleverest people I know. <br>I have huge admiration for them. <br>It\'s one of the reasons I came here. <br>But I was very struck by the fact that these great men！and they are nearly all men！failed entirely to anticipate this crisis. <br>Some have written very eloquently about it since it began. <br>But it has always made me nervous that it came as a surprise to them, and it makes me even more nervous that their response is to dig out theories from the 1930s, which seem to me almost not to have changed since the time of Keynes. <br>I give them all a B+, if not a B-, for their performance. <br>QUESTION: Your analysis is so brilliant. <br>But perhaps you could expand on the G-20. <br>A lot of the books！you alluded to your friend at Newsweek and so forth！are predicting that the one superpower is gone and that there is going to be a real change in the balance of power. <br>Certainly there are emerging nations who are sitting in the G-20 and saying, "This is the way the world has to be. <br>We have to have a greater influence on world decisions." How do you feel about this? It\'s so marvelous that you are giving us hope about America. <br>But what is the world going to look like in the very near future? NIALL FERGUSON: I have a certain skepticism that we can reengineer institutions like, let¨s say, the International Monetary Fund or, for that matter, the United Nations Security Council, in such a way as to increase the representation of emerging markets without rendering those institutions paralyzed. <br>What makes me nervous about something like the G-20 is the number 20. <br>I don¨t know about you, but I have been at very few meetings at which 20 people have sat around a table with equal bargaining power that have produced good results, as opposed to the kind of bland statement that we saw after the Washington summit last weekend. <br>I don¨t know if any of you read that statement, but it was actually a classic product of an excessively large committee. <br>What it said on the bottle was "Global Coordination." That indeed was the way the media played it. <br>What it said on the bottle was "Bretton Woods II" and "New Financial Architecture." But when you actually opened the bottle and poured out the wine, there was nothing there. <br>It was empty. <br>All the statement said was that the national regulators of the 20 countries represented at the summit should carry on doing what they are already supposed to do, only better, and we would meet again to discuss this further at the end of April. <br>1933 in London that was notable for its complete failure. <br>A great many countries were represented at that conference, but it all collapsed when the newly elected President Roosevelt sent a telegram from his yacht saying there would be no deal on exchange rates, which is what they were trying to arrive at. <br>I have a sinking feeling that the G-20 meetings will have a kind of analogous role in our time. <br>There will be great meetings that will get a lot of media coverage, but there will be no concrete results, because there are too many conflicting interests around the table. <br>The global financial architecture is changing. <br>That\'s clear. <br>But what really counts is the relationship between the United States and the surplus countries. <br>Everybody else, it seems to me, might as well go home. <br>If we can\'t get a deal on that key issue！the imbalance, the current account deficit！that manages its gradual reduction rather than its dramatic disappearance, then, frankly, there\'s simply no point holding these summits at all. <br>So if not a G-2, then something more like a G-2 plus three or four, bringing all the surplus countries into the room, is what we need. <br>My sense is that the G-20 is unwieldy, and trying to remodel international institutions with that large a group of countries is a doomed venture. <br>QUESTION: If the crisis was indeed made in America, as you say, and through the subprime lending for housing, my question really is, the political decisions that were made in housing at the time were designed to achieve a certain kind of political goal. <br>It was a certain kind of, perhaps, egalitarianism then run amok. <br>Many in the banking industry knew about that. <br>They knew that it was skating on thin ice. <br>What, in your mind, as a historian, as an analyst of all of these things, might have been done to avoid the kinds of results that occurred, while perhaps even still achieving the social goals that were the start of this whole thing? NIALL FERGUSON: I entirely agree with the premise of your question. <br>In Chapter 5 of this book, I talk about the idea of a property-owning democracy and ask the question, where did this come from? Why did we suddenly start to believe that it would be good for a majority of households to own their own homes? That certainly wasn\'t a 19th-century concept. <br>In the 19th century, it was assumed that only an elite would own property and the majority of people would be tenants who paid rent. <br>This is a fundamental shift in the political economy of the Western world. <br>It dates from the 1930s It\'s actually an absolutely crucial part of the New Deal that the Roosevelt Administration does not go down the road of building, as we would say in Britain, council housing, public-sector housing, for people to rent; it goes down the road of creating a very much wider and deeper mortgage market to encourage homeownership. <br>As you say, this has a political goal. <br>The theory goes like this: If people own their own homes, they will be politically more conservative than if they don\'t. <br>They will be less attracted to political radicalism. <br>In many ways, the theory is an appealing one. <br>If people are, in some measure, capitalists, if they own some stake in the country¨s capital, then they will be less attracted to the kind of political extremes that were so lethal a part of the 1930s crisis. <br>The question is, what proportion is the right proportion? Fifty percent? Fifty-five percent? Sixty percent? Sixty-five percent? Seventy percent? We have been trying to find this out by consistently increasing the proportion of households that own their own homes, using a number of inducements and institutional changes to make it easier. <br>The subprime crisis is the product of our discovery of the upper bound. <br>We found it. <br>It¨s somewhere in the mid-60-percent range. <br>If you go above that, you essentially attract people into the mortgage market who have no business being there and can\'t sustain mortgage payments for more than a couple of years. <br>There are all kinds of technical problems associated with what went wrong in the subprime market, but that\'s the fundamental political problem. <br>We created incentives that distorted people\'s investment interest that you can deduct from your tax bill, the mortgage interest, is a huge distortion in the way that the American capital market works. <br>It means you are nuts not to play the real estate market. <br>But think about what buying a house is. <br>It is a one-way, highly leveraged, completely unhedged bet on a single asset class. <br>From a purely financial point of view, it makes no sense at all to incentivize people to do this, to hold their wealth in this form. <br>From a political perspective, it may make sense, but we have discovered that from a financial perspective, it\'s actually highly dangerous. <br>So my answer to the question is, we need to wean ourselves off the simplistic view that owning a home is the American dream. <br>Ronald Reagan said this. <br>That was why he opposed removing the tax relief for mortgage interest. <br>I think this is an ideological distortion, a distortion of the financial market in pursuit of a somewhat illusory political goal of universal homeownership. <br>QUESTIONER: I¨m going to digress a little bit. <br>We know that in the last eight years, the United States has become exceedingly unpopular around the world as a result of many, many of the Bush-Cheney policies！apart from the war, how we have treated detainees, ignoring many aspects of the Geneva Convention, and so forth and so on. <br>What you have described now！the fact that the world is suffering as a result of something that we have precipitated！would certainly exacerbate or increase the hostility that the world feels toward the United States. <br>What I\'m asking you is, what do you see as the implications of this? Do you foresee some sort of retribution? There really is great, great anger toward us. <br>I wonder if you do see implications of this. <br>NIALL FERGUSON: I think this is a very good question. <br>When people talk about the damage to the credibility of the United States caused by the financial crisis, my response is, "The credibility was already damaged. <br>How much lower below zero can you go?" In that sense, this seems to me to be something of a misapprehension. <br>Yes, the neoconservative doctrine of the enforced democratization of the Middle East has been discredited. <br>The intervention in Iraq and the associated abuses that you described have done enormous damage. <br>We can see that from the Pew Global Attitudes surveys. <br>But I don\'t think it follows that the discrediting of the neoliberal financial theory that the market should be free, as free as possible, somehow compounds the problem. <br>This is why there is a paradox at the heart of this crisis, because the United States can do with one bound a kind of makeover of its image. <br>And it has just done it. <br>The unpopularity that the Pew surveys capture, when one looks at it, decomposes quite nicely. <br>It\'s the unpopularity of the Bush Administration, not the unpopularity of the United States, that is the phenomenon the polls are picking up. <br>In many ways, what happened on November 4 provides an extraordinary opportunity for the United States to rebrand itself and transform its international standing. <br>Simply by electing an extraordinarily charismatic young man who epitomizes a fundamental transformation in attitudes toward race in this country！this alone, it seems to me, negates a huge part of the damage done to American credibility by the eight years of the Bush Administration. <br>As I said, there is a kind of good luck that follows the United States through history. <br>It\'s good luck that the election happened when it did. <br>After all, the coincidence of the climax of the financial crisis and the election within the space of a few months was a remarkable historical conjuncture. <br>As I said, it took two more years of depression before the Roosevelt Administration came into being. <br>We have been lucky in the timing of this political change. <br>In the sense that Barack Obama has, above all, an extraordinary skill when it comes to changing the mood, his ability to speak with the kind of power that we can associate with only a very few politicians in our time creates a remarkable opportunity for changing the game and changing the mood, not only in the United States but in the wider world. <br>I would be very surprised if we didn\'t see a fundamental shift in those surveys of global attitudes towards the United States in the year ahead. <br>Despite the financial crisis, perhaps even because of it, the world is going to look, far more than it has done in many years, to Washington, D.C., for leadership. <br>That, I think, is the very paradox at the heart of my argument today. <br>You see, I¨m an optimist, really. <br>QUESTION: I want to just ask you to say some more about the G-2！the G-1 here. <br>Do you think that the people in the Obama Administration are thinking of China in the way that you are? On the other side！because you referred to the Bank of China！how much do you know or does anybody else know about what Chinese economists are analyzing? How close is their analysis to the gist of what you have said? Or are they really coming at this from some kind of immediate nationalistic perspective? If you could maybe elaborate on that G-2 relationship, that would be great. <br>NIALL FERGUSON: I can\'t claim great expertise on the way in which policy is made in Beijing. <br>I don\'t speak a word of Mandarin. <br>But it is the question that I ask my friends, Chinese and Chinese-speaking friends. <br>It is the question I asked people when I was out in Singapore last week at a conference attended by a great many people from the PRC, as well as from Hong Kong. <br>The answer I got, roughly, went like this: There is an argument going on between those who favor the prioritization of growing domestic consumption and those who see China as inextricably symbiotically linked to the United States. <br>It is not clear who is going to win this argument. <br>I think those numbers I quoted earlier about Chinese purchases of Treasuries are very heartening. <br>That suggests that, at least for the time being, the policy hasn\'t changed. <br>If it had been a different story, if the Chinese had also followed the Japanese example and sold, I would have been very nervous. <br>My sense is that ultimately the proponents of globalization will prevail over the proponents of market socialism in one country, for the practical reasons I have given. <br>But I don\'t think！and this is really the bottom line！I don¨t think we can take that for granted. <br>I think we should see as the paramount objective of the administration\'s foreign policy, when a secretary of state is finally nominated, to pursue the kind of Chimerican strategy that I\'m talking about, to make the G-2 a reality rather than just a pet theory of mine. <br>So if there is a kind of clear policy recommendation to both Washington and Beijing, it\'s that: Don\'t turn away from globalization and don\'t be deluded into thinking you can solve this crisis with the old Keynesian nostrums that only worked in the closed economies of the Bretton Woods era, when capital controls were imposed and exchange rates were fixed. <br>We\'re not in that world now, and it\'s an illusion to imagine that we can go back to it anytime soon. <br>With that, ladies and gentlemen, I think I\'ll fall silent. <br>Thank you very much. <br>',

'<h2><span class="orange">Women\'s Education</span></h2><br>Thank you so much for this incredible honor. <br>It\'s just moves me and matters to me greatly. <br>So, I really appreciate it. <br>You know I asked my four-year-old Hazel every day about what she learns in school. <br>I ask her every day and sometimes I met with you know she\'s four. <br>So, it\'s like, ‘I played\'. <br>And I\'m like, what else, you know tell me. <br>You know it\'s probably because she\'s tired or perhaps because I ask her every day and she\'s tired of me asking about her day. <br>But the other night it was like she threw me a bone as I was putting her to bed. <br>She said, ‘Hey mummy, do you know how to get to Harlem?\' And I just sort of stared at her dumbly and I said, ‘How do you get to Harlem?\' She goes, ‘You take the A train, it\'s the quickest way.\' And I was like, ‘What?\' You know and I said like, the Ella FitzGerald song. <br>She goes, ‘Yeah, Ella FitzGerald.\' And I almost wept, because Ella is like my gem, you know and then I discovered that she was learning about the Harlem renaissance at four. <br>I\'ve also been schooled on Lava caves, never heard of them before and the small bump on a baby owl\'s beak that it kind of uses to crack against the shell to birth itself. <br>I mean and then it falls off. <br>I\'m like how, this is stuff I\'ve never heard of before. <br>So, it\'s sort of become apparent to me that I ask Hazel every day what she learned at school. <br>Because well, I\'m desperate to know cool stuff like that mainly. <br>But to learn from her and I just sort of adore the look of delight in her eyes when she realizes she\'s teaching me something I knew nothing about. <br>She\'s just being nourished and inspired at school in ways I clearly can\'t keep up with. <br>I see in her and now in our youngest daughter too that they yearn to learn, they crave it in. <br>And in return the world sort of lights up for them and invites them to absorb the infinite possibilities that are available to them. <br>They are lucky enough and as was I and as were most girls that I knew growing up, that your dreams were not ever going to fall on deaf ears and that your thoughts and your voice mattered and could make a difference. <br>I said this to the incredible Malala Yousufzai, when we met for the first time. <br>And I was in fact rather overwhelmed to sit with her. <br>My husband John and I discovered this very deep connection to Malala\'s cause for women\'s education spurred on by the arrival of our two daughters. <br>She and her extraordinary father agreed to meet with us in London. <br>It\'s a train ride away from where they now live in Birmingham in England. <br>So, Malala is the name of a 19th century Afghan freedom fighter. <br>It\'s a soft sounding name that certainly packs a punch<br>© 2020 - ENGLISH SPEECHES | www.youtube.com/englishspeeches | englishspeecheschannel.com Emily Blunt: Women\'s Education | English Speeches and how appropriate for the person who bears it. <br>The most compassionate of hearts, but courage and will of steel. <br>Her name is sort of seared into our memories when news broke of the 15-year-old girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban on her school bus after hearing the demand, ‘Which one is Malala?\' And we wanted to know the same, who was she. <br>This girl shot in the head for championing in girls\' education. <br>Who was she? She along with her friends on that bus was determined to continue her education no matter the threat. <br>And as schools were bombed and houses were raided, and teachers were killed. <br>She was unbowed and untethered by the intolerable limitations that were placed on her freedom to be in the one place that she wanted to be in school. <br>When the bullets rained down on these girls, the world stopped in their tracks and they listened to Malala. <br>But most importantly so did millions of girls around the world put in the same position. <br>This courageous eloquent and inspiring girl became their light. <br>There are over 130 million girls missing out on an education. <br>Because they have to work, or they are married by the age of 12 or they lack access to school facilities or have to care for younger siblings. <br>Denying them their fundamental right to an education. <br>And the Malala fund is working tirelessly to ensure 12 years of school until they are 18 for every girl worldwide. <br>So, from empowering local leaders to shift the old-fashioned mindsets of early marriage in Pakistan and many other countries, creating learning programs for out-of-school married girls in Kenya. <br>They give access to quality education for Syrian refugees, building schools in remote and rural areas. <br>They are girl by girl transforming communities. <br>The potential for socio-economic growth when the other half of the population is given the opportunity to learn and then to work is limitless. <br>Malala knows this and they are seeing it firsthand in the communities they have touched. <br>That if women are given a voice, they are using it. <br>When they are handed the purse strings, the communities thrive. <br>When they are given a job, they flourish. <br>They organize better, they galvanize more passionately, and they are more likely to encourage peace where peace should be the priority. <br>I remember Malala\'s father saying something to me that, I will never forget. <br>He said, ‘Too many women die as if they have never been born.\' And I have never forgotten it. <br>John and I both feel we want to do as much as we can to help ensure that that statement doesn\'t hold true in the future. <br>I know that I will never meet anyone more inspiring than Malala in my lifetime. <br>I mean she\'s only the youngest ever Nobel peace prize laureate. <br>I doubt anyone could top her really. <br>She has set such a high bar, but her dream is that there will be others just like her. <br>Because if one girl with an education can change the world, well we just have to imagine what 130 million can do. <br>So, thank you so much. <br>I\'m so honored, thank you. <br>',

When a Bennington student, 10 minutes before you come up to the podium hands you a mace, that he made, If you don\'t bring it to the podium with you, you will never be Bennington. <br>So I would like to thank you Ben for helping me put the fear of God in the audience tonight. <br>But I have to put it down because I\'m an actor, and I am really weak. <br>That was heavy! It wasn\'t like a prop. <br>That shit was real! Thanks Ben. <br>So now I\'m going to read. <br>And I\'m not off book. <br>So I might be looking down a lot. <br>Thank you, President Coleman, Brian Conover, faculty, students, family, alumni, some of whom are dear friends of mine who have travelled all the way from the big city to see me hopefully not humiliate myself tonight. <br>And especially thanks to you, the Graduating Class of 2012. <br>See, as a joke I wrote, hold for applause, and I was actually going to read that. <br>So you kind of killed my joke! Let\'s do that again. <br>2012, hold for applause. <br>2012! Wow! I never thought I\'d see 2012. <br>I thought perhaps the Mayan calendar would prove correct. <br>And the end of the world would have been the greatest excuse to get me out of this terrifying task of delivering the commencement speech. <br>But wait! According to the Mayan calendar here, when does the world end? December — December 2012. <br>Damn! Okay. <br>Maybe I shouldn\'t talk to the graduates eager to start their new lives about the end of the world. <br>Okay. <br>Really? Really? Of all the novelists, teachers, playwrights, poets, groundbreaking visual artists and pioneers of science, you got the TV actor. <br>No, no, and I actually heard you petitioned for me. <br>Oh, you fools! You know what, for those of you who didn\'t petition for me, I would love to later on talk about the problems in the Middle East and the downfall of the world economy. <br>And for those of you who did petition for me, I don\'t have any signed DVDs of the Game of Thrones. <br>But I am happy to talk about the parallel lineages of the Targaryens and Lannisters later at the bar. <br>You see, it took all of my strength, and, of course, a little extra push from my wife Erica for me to agree to do this. <br>Because I don\'t do this. <br>In my profession, I am told by people who know what they\'re doing, where to stand, how to look, and most importantly, what to say. <br>But you\'ve got me — only me — my words unedited and as you will see quite embarrassing. <br>Okay, let me think. <br>I\'m thinking. <br>[But actually I didn\'t read that. <br>That was ad libbed.] Let me think. <br>What has — everyone and their uncle told me, as I desperately seek out advice on how to give a commencement address. <br>“Tell them what they want to hear.” “Talk about your time at Bennington.” “Know that there is no wrong speech.” I like that one. <br>“Just keep it brief.” That was my father-in-law. <br>“Be brutally honest. <br>Tell them how hard it is after you graduate.” We\'ll get back to that one. <br>“Just watch Meryl Streep\'s commencement speech at Barnard and you\'ll be fine.” What did Beckett say: “I Can\'t Go On, I\'ll Go On”. <br>So even if I don\'t burn in your hearts and minds long after this speech is over. <br>Even if I don\'t inspire you to reach for the stars and beyond. <br>Even if I am erased from your memory after one glass of wine tonight — Where am I going with this? I can\'t go on. <br>I\'ll go on. <br>You know, I won\'t speak of my time here, like some old fishermen. <br>You have already had your time here. <br>You have your own story to tell. <br>But I have to say. <br>For me, it did start here, in Vermont, on a very rainy night. <br>It was 1987. <br>And I was a prospective student. <br>The rain was coming down so hard, it was impossible to see that I was meeting the person who would later become my greatest friend and collaborator. <br>A freshman, who would, 17 years later, introduce me to the woman that became my wife. <br>I\'ll call him Sherm. <br>Because I do. <br>It was late at night, on the road, right there near Booth House. <br>And despite the dark night and the heavy rain, this place was so alive. <br>The lights pulsed from each of the dorms. <br>Now I was a kid from New Jersey who went to an all-boys catholic high school. <br>I was four-foot something. <br>I mumbled when I spoke. <br>I wore a sort of woman\'s black velvet cape, black tights, combat boots and a scowl. <br>But here at Bennington, I was home. <br>And I have to say it doesn\'t get better. <br>Let me clarify. <br>There are not shinier more important people out there. <br>Your fellow students, you friends sitting around you are as good as it gets. <br>Twenty two years after my own graduation, I have worked with my rainy night friend and fellow graduate Sherm on countless productions he has written, in all stages of development from living rooms to off-Broadway. <br>Brooks, Ian, Justin, Brett, John, Matthew, Jim, Sean, Hyla, Nicki and The B are all classmates I shared my time with here and still work with, and am lucky to call my friends. <br>We are very spoiled here. <br>People always say to me, “for such a small school it seems like there are so many of you”. <br>I find that really interesting. <br>And I kind of think that\'s perfect. <br>We can\'t help it. <br>We burn very brightly. <br>Please don\'t ever stop. <br>Graduates, now when I sat where you are right sitting right now, I had so many dreams of where I wanted to go, who I wanted to be, and what I wanted to do. <br>Theater companies I wanted to start with classmates. <br>Movies, I wanted to be in. <br>Directors I wanted to work with. <br>Stories I needed to tell. <br>It might take a little time, I thought. <br>But it would happen. <br>When I sat there, 22 years ago, what I didn\'t want to think about is where I would be tomorrow. <br>What I would have to start to do tomorrow. <br>And I graduated in 1991, a great year. <br>A time of resurgence for independent films in this country. <br>A time of relatively affordable rents in New York City. <br>See, I assumed that I could make a living writing my plays, acting way off off off Broadway. <br>And hopefully, you know, one day, join the actors I loved and respected in those independent films. <br>TV – oh, what, no. <br>What! Are you kidding me? No, didn\'t even consider that. <br>I had much more class than that. <br>Much more self-respect than that. <br>And so bothers — What I didn\'t have was cash, a bank account, a credit card, or an apartment. <br>I just had debt. <br>A big hungry, growing larger every moment debt. <br>So as you will tomorrow, I had to leave beautiful Vermont. <br>Attack the life that I knew with socks and a tooth brush into my backpack. <br>And I slept on ouch, after couch, after couch, after couch at friends\' apartments in New York. <br>Until I wore out the rent paying roommates\' welcome. <br>I didn\'t want a day job. <br>I was an actor, I was a writer. <br>I was a Bennington graduate. <br>I had to get a day job. <br>I dusted pianos at a piano store and let those streak for five months. <br>I worked on the property of a Shakespeare scholar for a year pulling weeds and removing bees\' nests. <br>I went on unemployment once but for not for long, I couldn\'t handle the guilt. <br>Eventually I was able to pay rent for a spot on the floor of an apartment on the Lower East side. <br>But my roommate had a breakdown and disappeared. <br>He later resurfaced in a religious cult. <br>I\'m making this sound<br>romantic. <br>It really wasn\'t. <br>I helped hang paintings at galleries, paintings that inspire you to think, I could do that. <br>And then finally, after two years of job and couch surfing, I got a job in application processing. <br>As a data enterer at a place called Professional Examination Services. <br>And I stayed for six years. <br>Six years! Longer than my time at Bennington. <br>From the age of 23 to 29, well they loved me there. <br>I was funny. <br>I wore black no cap no tights. <br>I smoked in the loading docks with the guys from the mail room and we shared how hung-over we all were. <br>Everyone called each other shortie. <br>What\'s up short? How you doing shortie? So how so hung-over shortie? I called in sick almost every Friday because I was out late the night before. <br>I hated that job. <br>And I clung to that job. <br>Because of that job, I could afford my own place. <br>So I lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. <br>Yeah, you say that now. <br>Oh, my kingdom for a time machine. <br>Yeah, that\'s right. <br>I lived in an industrial loft. <br>My rent was $400 a month. <br>My dream of running a theater company with my friend and fellow Bennington graduate, Ian bell had died. <br>I won\'t go into those details but neither one of us had any business sense and the theater we lived in. <br>It had no heat or hot water. <br>We didn\'t smell very good. <br>But we had our youth, but youth gets old very quickly. <br>You\'ll see. <br>So Ian moved out to Seattle. <br>And I moved up the street to my loft. <br>And I still didn\'t have heat. <br>In 1993, industrial loft meant not legal to live there. <br>See, I don\'t want this to sound cool and I feel like it\'s sounding cool. <br>Ad lib. <br>But I did have hot water — hot water in my bathroom, which a friend of mine using that bathroom once shouted, it smells exactly like. <br>A summer camp in here. <br>It was true. <br>For some reason, in the middle of Brooklyn, there was earth in my shower – actual earth and then oh, look, mushrooms growing from the earth. <br>But I was safe though. <br>The ideal fire control company was right across the street where they make all the chemicals that put out chemical fires. <br>I did not fear a chemical fire. <br>I would be OK. <br>And all those chemicals in the air were OK too. <br>Because up the street we had the spice factory, they made spices, and that just covered everything up in a nice cumin scent. <br>I had a rat. <br>But that was OK, because I got a cat. <br>His name was Brian, no relation. <br>My grandmother had given me a pink pull-out couch. <br>Oddly no friends or recent graduates wanted to crash on my couch. <br>So I put the couch on its end, so Brian could climb it and look out the window. <br>I had only the one window. <br>I myself could not look out the window. <br>It was – it was quite high. <br>So I had no heat. <br>No girlfriend. <br>What! Are you kidding me? No, acting agent. <br>But I had a cat named Brian who told me of<br>the world outside. <br>And I stayed for 10 years. <br>No, don\'t pity me. <br>There\'s a happy ending. <br>When I was 29, I told myself the next acting job I get no matter what it pays, I will from now on, for better or worse, be a working actor. <br>So I quit my position at the Professional Examination Services. <br>My friends really weren\'t happy about that, because it was so easy to find me when I worked there. <br>Work – that was the only place I had the internet. <br>This was at the beginning of the Internet. <br>And now I didn\'t have either the internet or a cell phone or a job. <br>But something good happened. <br>I got a little pink theater job in a play called Imperfect Love. <br>Which led to a film called 13 Moons with the same writer. <br>Which led to other roles. <br>Which led to other roles. <br>And I\'ve worked as an actor ever since. <br>But I didn\'t know that would happen. <br>At 29, walking away from data processing, I was terrified. <br>Ten years in a place without heat. <br>Six years at a job, I felt stuck in. <br>Maybe I was afraid of change. <br>Are you? My parents didn\'t have much money. <br>But they struggled to send me to the best schools. <br>And one of the most important things they did for me — and graduates, maybe you don\'t want to hear this – is that once I graduated, I was on my own. <br>Financially, it was my turn. <br>Parents are applauding, graduates are not. <br>But this made me very hungry. <br>Literally. <br>I couldn\'t be lazy. <br>Now I\'m totally lazy but back then, I couldn\'t be. <br>And so at 29, in a very long last, I was in the company of the actors and writers and directors I\'d start out that first year, that first day after school. <br>I was. <br>I am by their sides. <br>Raise the rest of your life to meet you. <br>Don\'t search for defining moments because they will never come. <br>Well, the birth of your children, OK, of course, forget about it, that\'s just six months. <br>My life is forever changed, that\'s most defining moment ever. <br>But I\'m talking about in the rest of your life and most importantly in your work. <br>The moments that define you have already happened. <br>And they will already happen again. <br>And it passes so quickly. <br>So please bring each other along with you. <br>Everyone you need is in this room. <br>These are the shiny more important people. <br>Sorry, it sucks after graduation. <br>It really does. <br>I mean, I don\'t know. <br>At least it did for me. <br>But that\'s the only thing I know. <br>You just get a bit derailed. <br>But soon something starts to happen. <br>Trust me. <br>A rhythm sets in. <br>Just like it did after your first few days here. <br>Just try not to wait until like me, you\'re 29 before you find it. <br>And if you are, that\'s fine too. <br>Some of us never find it. <br>But you will, I promise you. <br>You are already here. <br>That\'s such an enormous step all its own. <br>You\'ll find your rhythm, or continue the one you have already found. <br>I was walking downtown in Manhattan the other day. <br>And I was approached by a group of very sweet young ladies. <br>Easy. <br>Actually they\'re sort of running feverishly down the street after me. <br>When they got to me breathless, it was really — they didn\'t know what to say, or couldn\'t form the words. <br>But it came out that they were NYU freshmen. <br>And they were majoring in musical theater. <br>Of course, come on. <br>They were like science majors. <br>They are running after me. <br>“What musicals are you doing?” I inquired. <br>“Well,” one of them said, looking down at her shoes, “we aren\'t allowed to be in plays in our freshman year”. <br>Now they were paying a very high tuition to not do what they love doing. <br>I think I said, “Well, hang in there”. <br>What I should have said was, “Don\'t wait until they tell you you are ready. <br>Get in there”. <br>Sing or quickly transfer to Bennington. <br>When I went to school here, if a freshman wanted to write direct and star in her own musical, the lights would already be hung for her. <br>Now I tell the story, because the world might say you are not allowed to yet. <br>I waited a long time out in the world before I gave myself permission to fail. <br>Please, don\'t even bother asking, don\'t bother telling the world you are ready. <br>Show it. <br>Do it. <br>What did Beckett say? “Ever tried. <br>Ever failed. <br>No matter. <br>Try Again. <br>Fail again. <br>Fail better.” Bennington Class of 2012, the world is yours. <br>Treat everyone kindly and light up the night. <br>Thank you so much for having me here.',

'<h2><span class="orange">NATALIE PORTMAN: Don\'t Doubt Yourself</span></h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjxbqKcPX_4"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AjxbqKcPX_4/hqdefault.jpg"></a><h3>Don\'t Doubt Yourself</h3><br>Hello, class of 2015. <br>I am so honored to be here today. <br>Dean Khurana, faculty, parents, and most especially graduating students. <br>Thank you so much for inviting me. The Senior Class Committee. <br>It\'s genuinely one of the most exciting things I\'ve ever been asked to do. <br>I have to admit primarily because I can\'t deny it as it was leaked in the WikiLeaks release of the Sony hack that when I was invited, I replied, and I directly quote my own email, “wow! This is so nice! I\'m gonna need some funny ghost writers. <br>Any ideas?” This initial response, now blessedly public was from the knowledge that at my class day we were lucky enough to have Will Ferrel as class day speaker and many of us were hungover, or even freshly high, mainly wanted to laugh. <br>So I have to admit that today even 12 years after graduation. <br>I\'m still insecure about my own worthiness. <br>I have to remind myself today you\'re here for a reason. <br>Today I feel much like I did when I came to Harvard Yard as a freshman in 1999.When you guys were, to my continued shock and horror, still in kindergarten. <br>I felt like there had been some mistake that I wasn\'t smart enough to be in this company and that every time I opened my mouth, I would have to prove that I wasn\'t just a dumb actress. <br>So I start with an apology. <br>This won\'t be very funny. <br>I\'m not a comedian. <br>And I didn\'t get a ghost writer. <br>But I am here to tell you today. <br>Harvard is giving you all diplomas tomorrow. <br>You are here for a reason. <br>Sometimes your insecurities and your inexperience may lead you, too, to embrace other people\'s expectations, standards, or values. <br>But you can harness that inexperience to carve out your own path, one that is free of the burden of knowing how things are supposed to be, a path that is defined by its own particular set of reasons. <br>The other day I went to an amusement park with my soon-to-be 4-year-old son. <br>And I watched him play arcade games. <br>He was incredibly focused, throwing his ball at the target. <br>Jewish mother that I am, I skipped 20 steps and was already imagining him as a major league player with what is his aim and his arm and his concentration. <br>But then I realized what he wanted. <br>He was playing to trade in his tickets for the crappy plastic toy. <br>The prize was much more exciting than the game to get it. <br>I, of course, wanted to urge him to take joy and the challenge of the game, the improvement upon practice, the satisfaction of doing something well, and even feeling the accomplishment when achieving the game\'s goals. <br>But all of these aspects were shaded by the little 10-cent plastic men with sticky stretchy blue arms that adhere to the walls. <br>That-that was the prize. <br>In a child\'s nature, we see many of our own innate tendencies. <br>I saw myself in him and perhaps you do, too. <br>Prizes serve as false idols everywhere, prestige, wealth, fame, power. <br>You\'ll be exposed to many of these, if not all. <br>Of course, part of why I was invited to come to speak today beyond my being a proud alumna is that I\'ve recruited some very coveted toys in my life, including a not so plastic, not so crappy one: an Oscar. <br>So we bump up against a common trope I think of the commencement address people who have achieved a lot telling you that the fruits of the achievement are not always to be trusted. <br>But I think that contradiction can be reconciled and is in fact instructive. <br>Achievement is wonderful when you know why you\'re doing it. <br>And when you don\'t know, it can be a terrible trap. <br>I went to a public high school on Long Island, Syosset High School. <br>Ooh, hello, Syosset! The girls I went to school with had Prada bags and flat-ironed hair. <br>And they spoke with an accent I who had moved there at age 9 from Connecticut mimicked to fit in. <br>Florida Oranges, Chocolate cherries. <br>Since I \'m ancient and the Internet was just starting when I was in high school, people didn\'t really pay that much of attention to the fact that I was an actress. <br>I was known mainly at school for having a backpack bigger than I was and always having white-out on my hands because I hated seeing anything crossed out in my note books. <br>I was voted for my senior yearbook “most likely to be a contestant on Jeopardy” or code for nerdiest. <br>When I got to Harvard just after the release of Star Wars: Episode 1, I knew I would be staring over in terms of how people viewed me. <br>I feared people would have assumed I\'d gotten in just for being famous, and that they would think that I was not worthy of the intellectual rigor here. <br>And it would not have been far from the truth. <br>When I came here I had never written a 10-pape paper before. <br>I\'m not even sure I\'ve written a 5-page paper. <br>I was alarmed and intimidated by the calm eyes of a fellow student who came here from Dalton or Exeter, who thought that compared to high school the workload here was easy. <br>I was completely overwhelmed and thought that reading 1000 pages a week was unimaginable, that writing a 50-page thesis is just something I could never do. <br>I had no idea how to declare my intentions. <br>I couldn\'t even articulate them to myself. <br>I\'ve been acting since I was 11. <br>But I thought acting was too frivolous and certainly not meaningful. <br>I came from a family of academics and was very concerned of being taken seriously. <br>In contrast to my inability to declare myself, on my first day of orientation freshman year, five separate students introduced themselves to me by saying I\'m going to be president; remember I told you that. <br>Their names, for the record, were Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton. <br>In all seriousness, I believed every one of them. <br>Their bearing and self-confidence alone seemed the proof of their prophecy where I couldn\'t shake my self-doubt. <br>I got in only because I was famous. <br>This was how others saw me and it was how I saw myself. <br>Driven by these insecurities, I decided I was going to find something to do in Harvard that was serious and meaningful, that would change the world and make it a better place. <br>At the age of 18, I\'d already been acting for 7 years, and assumed I find a more serious and profound path in college. <br>So freshman fall I decided to take Neurobiology and Advanced Modern Hebrew Literature because I was serious and intellectual. <br>Needless to say, I should have failed both. <br>I got Bs, for your information, and to this day, every Sunday I burn a small effigy to the pagan Gods of grade inflation. <br>But as I was fighting my way through Aleph Bet Yod Y\'shua in Hebrew and the different mechanisms of neuro-response, I saw friends around me writing papers on sailing and pop culture magazines, and professors teaching classes on fairy tales and The Matrix. <br>I realized that seriousness for seriousness\'s sake was its own kind of trophy, and a dubious one, a pose I sought to counter some half-imagined argument about who I was. <br>There was a reason that I was an actor. <br>I love what I do. <br>And I saw from my peers and my mentors that it was not only an acceptable reason, it was the best reason. <br>When I got to my graduation, siting where you sit today after 4 years of trying to get excited about something else, I admitted to myself that I couldn\'t wait to go back and make more films. <br>I wanted to tell stories, to imagine the lives of others and help others do the same. <br>I have found or perhaps reclaimed my reason. <br>You have a prize now or at least you will tomorrow. <br>The prize is Harvard degree in your hand. <br>But what is your reason behind it? My Harvard degree represents, for me, the curiosity and invention that were encouraged here, the friendships I\'ve sustained, the way Professor Graham told me not to describe the way light hit a flower but rather the shadow the flower cast, the way Professor Scarry talked about theatre is a transformative religious force, how professor Coslin showed how much our visual cortex is activated just by imaging. <br>Now granted these things don\'t necessarily help me answer the most common question I\'m asked: What designer are you wearing? What\'s your fitness regime? Any makeup tips? But I have never since been<br>embarrassed to myself as what I might previously have thought was a stupid question. <br>My Harvard degree and other awards are emblems of the experiences which led me to them. <br>The wood paneled lecture halls, the colorful fall leaves, the hot vanilla Toscaninis, reading great novels in overstuffed library chairs, running through dining halls screaming: Ooh! Ah! City steps! City steps! City steps! City steps! It\'s easy now to romanticize my time here. <br>But I had some very difficult times here too. <br>Some combination of being 19, dealing with my first heartbreak, taking birth control pills that have since been taken off the market for their depressive side effects, and spending too much time missing daylight during winter mouths led me to some pretty dark moments, particularly during sophomore year. <br>There were several occasions where I started crying in meetings with professors, overwhelmed with what I was supposed to pull off when I could barely get myself out of bed in the morning, moments when I took on the motto for school work. <br>“Done. <br>Not good.” If only I could finish my work, even if it took eating a jumbo pack of sour Patch Kids to get me through a single 10-page paper. <br>I felt that I\'d accomplished a great feat. <br>I repeat to myself. <br>“Done. <br>Not good.” A couple of years ago, I went to Tokyo with my husband and I ate at the most remarkable sushi restaurant. <br>I don\'t even eat fish. <br>I\'m vegan. <br>So that tells you how good it was. <br>Even with just vegetables, this sushi was the stuff you dreamed about. <br>The restaurant has six seats. <br>My husband and I marveled at how anyone can make rice so superior to all other rice. <br>We wondered why they didn\'t make a bigger restaurant and be the most popular place in town. <br>Our local friend explained to us that all the best restaurants in Tokyo are that small and do only one type of dish: sushi or tempura or teriyaki, because they want to do that thing well and beautifully. <br>And it\'s not about quantity. <br>It\'s about taking pleasure in the perfection and beauty of the particular. <br>I\'m still learning now that it\'s about good and maybe never done. <br>And the joy and work ethic and virtuosity we bring to the particular can impart a singular type of enjoyment to those we give to and of course, ourselves. <br>In my professional life, it also took me time to find my own reasons for doing my work. <br>The first film I was in came out in 1994. <br>Again, appallingly, the year most of you were born. <br>I was 13 years old upon the film\'s release and I can still quote what the New York Times said about me verbatim. <br>“Ms. <br>Portman poses better than she acts.” The film had universally tepid critic response and went on to bomb commercially. <br>That film was called The Professional, or Leon in Europe. <br>And today, 20 years and 35 films later, it is still the film people approach me about the most to tell me how much they loved it, how much it moved them, how it\'s their favorite movie. <br>I feel lucky that my first experience of releasing a film was initially such a disaster by all standards and measures. <br>I learned early that my meaning had to be from the experience of making a film and the possibility of connecting with individuals rather than the foremost trophies in my industry: financial and critical success. <br>And also these initial reactions could be false predictors of your work\'s ultimate legacy. <br>I started choosing only jobs that I\'m passionate about and from which I knew I could glean meaningful experiences. <br>This thoroughly confused everyone around me: agents, producers, and audiences alike. <br>I made Gotya\'s Ghost, a foreign independent film and study our history visiting the Prado everyday for 4 months as I read about Goya and the Spanish Inquisition. <br>I made V for Vendetta, studio action movie for which I learned everything I could about freedom fighters whom otherwise may be called terrorists. <br>From Menachem Begin to Weather Underground, I made Your Highness, a pothead comedy with Danny McBride and laughed for 3 months straight. <br>I was able to own my meaning and not have it be determined by box office receipts or prestige. <br>By the time I got to making Black Swan, the experience was entirely my own. <br>I felt immune to the worst things anyone could say or write about me, and to whether an audience felt like going to see my movie or not. <br>It was instructive for me to see, for ballet dancers once your technique gets to a certain level, the only thing that separates you from others is your quirks or even flaws. <br>One ballerina was famous for how she turned slightly off balanced. <br>You can never be the best, technically. <br>Someone will always have a higher jump or a more beautiful line. <br>The only thing you can be the best at is developing your own self. <br>Authoring your own experience was very much what Black Swan itself was about. <br>I worked with Darren Aronofsky, the film\'s director, who changed my last line in the movie to: it was perfect. <br>My character Nina is only artistically successful when she finds perfection and pleasure for herself not when she was trying to be perfect in the eyes of others. <br>So when Black Swan was successful financially and I began receiving accolades, I felt honored and grateful to have connected with people. <br>But the true core of my meaning, I had already established. <br>And I needed it to be independent of people\'s reactions to me. <br>People told me that Black Swan was an artistic risk, a scary challenge to try to portray a professional ballet dancer. <br>But it didn\'t feel like courage or daring that drew me to it. <br>I was so oblivious to my own limits that I did things I was woefully unprepared to do. <br>And so the very inexperience that in college had made me insecure and made me want to play by other\'s rules now is making me actually take risks I didn\'t even realize were risks. <br>When Darren asked me if I could do ballet, I told him I was basically a ballerina which, by the way, I wholeheartedly believed. <br>When it quickly became clear that preparing for film, that I was 15 years away from being a ballerina, it made me work a million times harder and of course the magic of cinema and body doubles helped the final effect. <br>But the point is, if I had known my own limitations, I never would take of the risk. <br>And the risk led to one of my greatest artistic personal experiences, and that I not only felt completely free, I also met my husband during the filming. <br>Similarly, I just directed my first film, A Tale of love in Darkness. <br>I was quite blind to the challenges ahead of me. <br>The film is a period film, completely in Hebrew, in which I also act with an eight-year-old child as a costar. <br>All of these are challenges I should have been terrified of as I was completely unprepared for them, but my complete ignorance to my own limitations looked like confidence and got me into the director\'s chair. <br>Once here, I have to figure it all out, and my belief that I could handle these things, contrary to all evidence of my ability to do so, was only half the battle. <br>The other half was very hard work. <br>The experience was the deepest and most meaningful one of my career. <br>Now clearly I\'m not urging you to go and perform heart surgery without the knowledge to do so! Making movies admittedly has less drastic consequences than most professions and allows for a lot of effects that make up for mistakes. <br>The thing I\'m saying is, make use of the fact that you don\'t doubt yourself too much right now. <br>As we get older, we get more realistic, and that includes about our own abilities or lack thereof, and that realism does us no favors. <br>People always talk about diving into things you\'re afraid of. <br>That never worked for me. <br>If I am afraid, I run away. <br>And I would probably urge my child to do the same. <br>Fear protects us in many ways. <br>What has served me is diving into my own obliviousness, being more confident than I should be, which everyone tends to decry American kids, and those of us who have been grade inflated and ego inflated. <br>Well. <br>It can be a good thing if it makes you try things you never might have tried.<br>Your inexperience is an asset, and will allow you to think in original and unconventional way. <br>Accept your lack of knowledge and use it as your asset. <br>I know a famous violinist who told me that he can\'t compose because he knows too many pieces. <br>So when he starts thinking of a note, an existing piece immediately comes to mind. <br>Just starting out of your biggest strengths is, not knowing how things are supposed to be. <br>You can compose freely because your mind isn\'t cluttered with too many pieces. <br>And you don\'t take for granted the way things are. <br>The only way you know how to do things is your own way. <br>You here will all go on to achieve great things. <br>There is no doubt about that. <br>Each time you set out to do something new, your inexperience can either lead you down a path where you will conform to someone else\'s values or you can forge your own path, even though you don\'t realize that\'s what you\'re doing. <br>If your reasons are your own, your path, even if it\'s a strange and clumsy path, will be wholly yours, and you will control the rewards of what you do by making your internal life fulfilling. <br>At the risk of sounding like a Miss American Contestant, the most fulfilling things I\'ve experienced have truly been the human interactions: spending time with women in village banks in Mexico with FINCA microfinance organization, meeting young women who were the first and the only in their communities to attend secondary schools in rural Kenya with free the Children group that built sustainable schools in developing countries tracking with gorilla conservationists in Rwanda. <br>It\'s cliché, because it\'s true that helping other ends up helping you more than anyone. <br>Getting out of your own concerns and caring about some else\'s life for a while, remind you that you are not the central of the universe, and that in the ways we\'re generous or not, we can change course of someone\'s life. <br>Even at work, the small feat of kindness crew members, directors, fellow actors have shown me, have had the most lasting impact. <br>And of course, first and foremost, the center of my world is the love that I share with my family and friends. <br>I wish for you that your friends will be with you through it all as my friends from Harvard have been together since we graduated. <br>My friends from school are still very close. <br>We\'ve nursed each other through heartaches and danced at each other\'s weddings. <br>We\'ve held each other at funerals, and rocked each other\'s new babies. <br>We\'ve worked together on projects, helped each other get jobs, and thrown parties for when we\'ve quit bad ones. <br>And now our children are creating a second generation of friendship as we look at them toddling together. <br>Haggard and disheveled working parents that we are. <br>Grab the good people around you and don\'t let them go. <br>The biggest asset this school offers you is a group of peers that will both be your family and your school life. <br>I remember always being pissed at the spring here in Cambridge, tricking us into remembering a sunny yard full of laughing Frisbee throwers after 8 months of dark frigid library dwelling. <br>It was like the school had managed to turn on the good weather. <br>As a last memory, we should keep in mind that would make us want to come back. <br>But as I got farther away my years here, I know the power of this school is much deeper than weather control. <br>It changed the very questions that I was asking. <br>To quote one of my favorite thinkers Abraham Joshua Hechel: To be or not to be is not the question; the vital question is how to be and how not to be. <br>Thank you! I can\'t wait to see how you do all the beautiful things you will do. <br>',

"<h2>Netherlands experience</h2><br>About a year ago, I became a Dutch citizen. <br>In the age of corona, it was a strange experience: I cycled to the city hall through empty streets, with an ambulance siren wailing in the distance, then waited behind a glass screen for a while before being handed an envelope of new identity documents. <br><br>There was no ceremony, no handshake with the mayor, no national anthem. <br>The whole experience felt more like collecting a new driving license than a moment of celebration. <br>Despite the somber mood, however, I was genuinely thrilled to become a Dutchman. <br><br>I'd moved to the Netherlands about a decade earlier and had quickly built a good life here; learning the Dutch language, having a half-Dutch family, buying a house in the Groene Hart, and writing books about Dutch history and culture. <br>In that context, I was proud to become a Dutchman; a happy, prosperous citizen of a country I loved and admired. <br>In an odd way, acquiring citizenship also felt like giving a vote of confidence to the country as a whole. <br><br>First wave At the time I went and collected my citizenship papers, the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was just unfolding, and this country seemed to be handling things remarkably well. <br>There'd been some early missteps, but overall, even as other countries reported panic-buying of goods like toilet paper, the Dutch responded with typical nuchterheid (sobriety). <br>`We can poop for 10 years,' Mark Rutte said with a smile. <br><br>The contrast with my old home country, Britain, which was then still battling its way towards a Brexit deal and changing governments more often than most people change their socks, looked stark. <br>And if there was anywhere in the world which could prevent a `first wave' or a `second wave', then I assumed it was here: the country which practically invented disaster prevention. <br>`This might,' I wrote on my blog, `be the Polder Model's finest hour'. <br><br>Photo: DutchNews.nl Nearly a year later, I'm sorry to say those words look a little naïve. <br>By some measures the Netherlands has done reasonably well: the total number of deaths caused by corona is (relative to the total population) significantly lower here than in Britain, France or Belgium. <br>More deaths However, take a step back and you'll quickly see that while this country's performance hasn't been entirely awful, it's not been very good either. <br><br>Adjusted for population, the Netherlands has had significantly more deaths than Germany, and more than twice as many as Denmark. <br>Infections have, at times, been higher than almost anywhere else in Europe. <br>Patients have been airlifted abroad because Dutch hospitals couldn't cope, and we've been among the slowest in Europe to deliver lifesaving vaccines. <br><br>The gap between what should have been possible in this country and what's actually been achieved feels vast. <br>As a new citizen, watching the government flailing to explain why something else has gone wrong, I'm often reminded of what my mother used to say to me when I misbehaved as a teenager: `I'm not angry. <br>I'm just very, very disappointed'. <br><br>As a sort-of newcomer, I've also realized that some of the things I originally admired about this country have turned out to be critical weaknesses. <br>When I arrived in the Netherlands years ago, after working as a political adviser in London, I remember being amazed by how grown-up Dutch politics seemed, with its constant emphasis on evidence and compromise. <br>If Westminster felt like a boxing ring where everyone was constantly furious with one another, the Hague was more like a friendly club or university, filled with kind, clever people who worked together to get things done. <br><br>Things moved slowly, but when living below sea level, it paid to not make any sudden moves. <br>Happy society In normal times, this difference-splitting often worked fantastically well, helping the Netherlands become one of the wealthiest, safest and happiest societies in the world. <br>Yet it's become clear that during a crisis, these same mechanisms can lead to paralysis. <br><br>Photo: DutchNews.nl One example of this was the infamous debate over masks. <br>The WHO recommended that masks should be worn in confined public spaces on 5th June. <br>The UK made masks mandatory on public transport on 15th June, and in shops from 24th July. <br><br>France made masks mandatory in shops in late July, and even McDonald's in the US made them mandatory for customers from 1st August. <br>In the sensible Netherlands, however, the simple act of wearing a mask somehow remained as controversial as Zwarte Piet. <br>Faced with a situation where there was an urgent need to do unpopular things, the authorities wasted months dithering and debating. <br><br>Mayors told people to wear masks, the RIVM told them not to bother, and ministers seemed unable to decide either way. <br>As a result of all this, masks didn't become compulsory in public until 1st December – four months after McDonalds – by which point nearly ten thousand Dutch people had died, including (presumably) some who might have lived if mask-wearing had been routine. <br>While leaders like Joe Biden, Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson are rarely seen without a mask, we almost never see Rutte with one. <br><br>And it's not just masks that came late. <br>Other sensible policies – testing for children with symptoms, discouraging foreign holidays, making more space inside shops – were introduced far later than they should have been. <br>Corona app Hugo de Jonge's famous corona app was announced in the spring but not launched until months later, by which time Germany's version had almost as many users as the Netherlands has people. <br><br>Every week seems to bring another new example of government by hesitation: a promise that the OMT will think about something, that the RIVM will review data, that the cabinet will have a meeting to decide whether to think about potentially changing the policy in three weeks' time. <br>Faced with a deadly crisis, the Dutch state seems like an oil tanker floating in erwtensoep: incapable of changing direction fast. <br>Photo: DutchNews.nl Another surprise has been the odd arrogance which permeates the Netherlands' response. <br><br>We hear a lot about American exceptionalism – the idea, proposed by Alexis de Tocqueville and others, that Americans think their country is superior to others, and uniquely qualified to lead the world. <br>Yet it seems to me that the Dutch also exhibit a similar trait; breezily assuming that our way is best, and that other countries only do badly because they're too lazy or too disorganized to run things properly. <br>(Just look, for example, at Jeroen Dijsselbloem's notorious claim that southern European countries `spend all the money on spirits and women', or Rutte saying England had `collapsed politically, monetarily, constitutionally and economically'. <br><br>Sensible During the pandemic, we've consistently heard that the Netherlands doesn't need hard lockdowns like other countries, because we're more sensible here. <br>Asked in March 2020 why he wasn't locking down harder, Rutte replied: `That… does not fit with the mature democratic proud Netherlands… with a mature democratic country'. <br>Over the following months the message remained largely the same: `We are grown-up people', and the situation here was not `like in other countries'.[Even the name of the government's flagship policy spoke volumes: `Intelligent Lockdown', with its clear implication that everyone else's version was stupid. <br><br>Politically, this rhetoric was understandable: leaders are unlikely to lose votes by telling the public they're clever. <br>But the problem is that telling people they are at lower risk can encourage risky behaviour. <br>For much of last summer, many people here acted as if there was a special Dutch variant of coronavirus which somehow made them immune, and continued doing things which other Europeans considered impossible: going to gyms, sitting in busy restaurants, having parties in crowded living rooms and flying abroad on holiday; even as other countries locked down. <br><br>Testing According to RIVM surveys, only half of Dutch stay home if they have symptoms and only half get tested. <br>Nuchterheid often looks more like roekeloosheid (recklessness). <br>By mid-December, the Netherlands had one of the highest rates of infection in Europe, the concept of `intelligent lockdown' had been quietly dropped, and we were heading into a real lockdown instead. <br><br>`Grown-up', `stubborn' Nederlanders turned out to be just as vulnerable as everyone else. <br>Yet despite this, I've lost track of the number of times someone has said to me something like: `It's terrible, how things are going in your country', meaning Britain – even at times when the Netherlands has actually been doing worse. <br>Other countries' failures prove we're right, but their successes are largely ignored. <br><br>I can almost imagine the guys in my favorite bar in Rotterdam shouting: `Yes, Belgium's infections are lower, but have you seen the state of their roads?!' Photo: DutchNews.nl More recently, we've also seen exceptionalist attitudes play out with respect to vaccines. <br>If there was any country which should have been able to get vaccination right, it's this one: small and densely populated, richer than Germany or Saudi Arabia, with excellent transport links and almost everyone living close to a family doctor or hospital. <br>Vaccination problems But despite these advantages, our performance has been lamentable: as of early February, the total number of Dutch people who'd received a vaccine was far less than the number of British people getting vaccinated every day. <br><br>Thousands have died since the first vaccines got regulatory approval, and it's clear that normal life won't resume until most people have been vaccinated. <br>However, many people still seem to think long delays don't matter as long as we get there in the end – which is a bit like saying that if your house is on fire, it makes no difference whether the fireman comes today or in September. <br>While we seem to like international comparisons when they make us look good (GDP growth, debt, deficits), when they make us look bad (infection rates, vaccinations) they're derided (`this isn't a competition!') Rather than being blunt about failures, people suggest it's others who have the problem and the Netherlands getting things right. <br><br>`We choose not to have a symbolic [early] vaccination', De Jonge said in December. <br>`It's not responsible to do it sooner'. <br>In other words: if things go slowly here, it's because others are careless, not because we've done badly. <br><br>Dutch failure is thus presented as proof of Dutch superiority. <br>George Orwell would be proud. <br>Historical roots Thinking about what causes such attitudes, you could look for deep historical roots: old religious habits of judging bad behavior; the `VOC mentaliteit` which rests on the assumption that clever Dutchmen know how to run the world. <br><br>However, it seems to me that the fumbled response to corona can again be blamed partly on the political system. <br>In places like England or the US, there's a clear divide between (roughly speaking) one major governing party and one major opposition party. <br>If the former messes something up, the latter will criticize them intensely. <br><br>In the Netherlands, however, some of Rutte's biggest rivals are in his cabinet. <br>When failures do happen, the fiercest scrutiny often comes not from the mainstream but from stubborn individuals like Peter Omtzigt (CDA) – but if you vote for those critics, you might just help their parties form another coalition with Rutte at the top. <br>Attitudes have hardened in recent years, and there are plenty of populist politicians who could start a fight in an empty room. <br><br>But the political culture remains remarkably forgiving of failure. <br>Dutch people have a reputation for directness, but when things go wrong or people behave badly (holding a wedding party in defiance of lockdown, for example) the instinct is still usually to say: `Let's not be mean, it is what it is, we're all friends here!' Blame game With a four-party coalition, lines of accountability are blurred: when the government makes mistakes, who can say who's to blame? Like a gang of kids caught breaking a window, coalition parties can all just point at each other and shout: `It wasn't me, it was them!' Photo: DutchNews.nl The media also plays a role. <br>Many Dutch journalists do amazing work, but there's also sometimes an unwillingness to ask hard questions. <br><br>Is it really good for the country that if the prime minister gives a detailed presentation about thousands of people dying and vaccines going undelivered, the first question is always something like: `How will this affect our holiday plans?' After a grim start to 2021, attitudes do seem to have shifted now. <br>Everyone's stressed and bored, and patience is wearing thin. <br>The government's being criticized harshly, and even Rutte has criticized `stubborn' Nederlanders for not following the rules. <br><br>However, looking at surveys across the past year, the prevailing public mood seems to be benign acceptance. <br>Surveys conducted by I&O show that support for the cabinet's approach to corona fell between March 2020 and May 2020, but then remained stable for months afterwards. <br>In May 2020, 75% of Dutch people said they largely supported the government's corona policies; by January 2021, it was still 72% – higher than it had been in October, before the last wave of infections. <br><br>In January, 58% of Dutch people said they were satisfied with the country's vaccination campaign, compared with only 31% of French people. <br>Election Political polls demonstrate similar passivity. <br>After a year of corona, around fifteen thousand deaths, an economic crisis, the toeslagenaffaire, riots and the vaccination debacle, the VVD is on course to win twice as many seats as any other party. <br><br>Whichever party you support, that juxtaposition is remarkable. <br>Based on current trends, Rutte could ban bitterballen and sell parliament to the Germans and still win more votes than before. <br>A year on from my low-key citizenship `ceremony', I'm still thrilled to be a Dutchman, and adore many things about this country: our people, our scenery, our history, the fact that it's fine to eat cheese for breakfast. <br><br>There are some things about the corona response which I admire, including the heroic way many public services have kept going. <br>It's possible that in a few years' time, we'll look back and think we didn't do that badly overall. <br>But it's also undeniable that in my first year as a Dutchman, my view of the Netherlands has changed in ways which I never imagined possible. <br><br>Photo: DutchNews.nl Somewhere I thought was an island of stability and efficiency has botched things which should have been straightforward. <br>In denial about the scale of the problem, many people have behaved carelessly, or just shrugged passively as things get worse. <br>Past fantasies And the system itself seems to be creaking. <br><br>As a Brit, after 2016 I grew used to hearing arguments that Britain is a country which failed to find a convincing role after the collapse of its empire and has been living off past glories and fantasies for too long. <br>Now, as a Dutchman, that seems like a cautionary tale. <br>It's hard not to feel troubled by the way we whitewash over our failures and cling to the past glories of the Polder Model, Golden Age and Delta Works. <br><br>As I write this, my new Dutch passport sits in the drawer of my desk, uncreased and still waiting to be used. <br>When I do get to travel again, if someone asks where I'm from, I'll be truly proud to say: `I'm a Dutchman, from a wonderful country called the Netherlands'. <br>But if they ask how our country is run, I'll say: `We do lots of things well, but we get some things badly wrong.` <br>",

'<h2>Two Brains Running</h2><br>In 2002, Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel in economic science. <br>What made this unusual is that Kahneman is a psychologist. <br>Specifically, he is one-half of a pair of psychologists who, beginning in the early 1970s, set out to dismantle an entity long dear to economic theorists: that arch-rational decision maker known as Homo economicus. <br><br>The other half of the dismantling duo, Amos Tversky, died in 1996 at the age of 59. <br>Had Tversky lived, he would certainly have shared the Nobel with Kahneman, his longtime collaborator and dear friend.<br>Human irrationality is Kahneman’s great theme. <br><br>There are essentially three phases to his career. <br>In the first, he and Tversky did a series of ingenious experiments that revealed twenty or so “cognitive biases” — unconscious errors of reasoning that distort our judgment of the world. <br>Typical of these is the “anchoring effect”: our tendency to be influenced by irrelevant numbers that we happen to be exposed to. <br><br>(In one experiment, for instance, experienced German judges were inclined to give a shoplifter a longer sentence if they had just rolled a pair of dice loaded to give a high number.) In the second phase, Kahneman and Tversky showed that people making decisions under uncertain conditions do not behave in the way that economic models have traditionally assumed; they do not “maximize utility.” The two then developed an alternative account of decision making, one more faithful to human psychology, which they called “prospect theory.” (It was for this achievement that Kahneman was awarded the Nobel.) In the third phase of his career, mainly after the death of Tversky, Kahneman has delved into “hedonic psychology”: the science of happiness, its nature and its causes. <br>His findings in this area have proved disquieting — and not just because one of the key experiments involved a deliberately prolonged colonoscopy.<br>“Thinking, Fast and Slow” spans all three of these phases. <br><br>It is an astonishingly rich book: lucid, profound, full of intellectual surprises and self-help value. <br>It is consistently entertaining and frequently touching, especially when Kahneman is recounting his collaboration with Tversky. <br>(“The pleasure we found in working together made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored.”) So impressive is its vision of flawed human reason that the New York Times columnist David Brooks recently declared that Kahneman and Tversky’s work “will be remembered hundreds of years from now,” and that it is “a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.” They are, Brooks said, “like the Lewis and Clark of the mind.”<br><br>Now, this worries me a bit. <br>A leitmotif of this book is overconfidence. <br>All of us, and especially experts, are prone to an exaggerated sense of how well we understand the world — so Kahneman reminds us. <br><br>Surely, he himself is alert to the perils of overconfidence. <br>Despite all the cognitive biases, fallacies and illusions that he and Tversky (along with other researchers) purport to have discovered in the last few decades, he fights shy of the bold claim that humans are fundamentally irrational.<br>Or does he? “Most of us are healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are appropriate most of the time,” Kahneman writes in his introduction. <br><br>Yet, just a few pages later, he observes that the work he did with Tversky “challenged” the idea, orthodox among social scientists in the 1970s, that “people are generally rational.” The two psychologists discovered “systematic errors in the thinking of normal people”: errors arising not from the corrupting effects of emotion, but built into our evolved cognitive machinery. <br>Although Kahneman draws only modest policy implications (e.g., contracts should be stated in clearer language), others — perhaps overconfidently? — go much further. <br>Brooks, for example, has argued that Kahneman and Tversky’s work illustrates “the limits of social policy”; in particular, the folly of government action to fight joblessness and turn the economy around.<br><br>Such sweeping conclusions, even if they are not endorsed by the author, make me frown. <br>And frowning — as one learns on Page 152 of this book — activates the skeptic within us: what Kahneman calls “System 2.” Just putting on a frown, experiments show, works to reduce overconfidence; it causes us to be more analytical, more vigilant in our thinking; to question stories that we would otherwise unreflectively accept as true because they are facile and coherent. <br>And that is why I frowningly gave this extraordinarily interesting book the most skeptical reading I could.<br><br>System 2, in Kahneman’s scheme, is our slow, deliberate, analytical and consciously effortful mode of reasoning about the world. <br>System 1, by contrast, is our fast, automatic, intuitive and largely unconscious mode. <br>It is System 1 that detects hostility in a voice and effortlessly completes the phrase “bread and. . . . ” <br>It is System 2 that swings into action when we have to fill out a tax form or park a car in a narrow space. <br>(As Kahneman and others have found, there is an easy way to tell how engaged a person’s System 2 is during a task: just look into his or her eyes and note how dilated the pupils are.)<br>More generally, System 1 uses association and metaphor to produce a quick and dirty draft of reality, which System 2 draws on to arrive at explicit beliefs and reasoned choices. <br><br>System 1 proposes, System 2 disposes. <br>So System 2 would seem to be the boss, right? In principle, yes. <br>But System 2, in addition to being more deliberate and rational, is also lazy. <br><br>And it tires easily. <br>(The vogue term for this is “ego depletion.”) Too often, instead of slowing things down and analyzing them, System 2 is content to accept the easy but unreliable story about the world that System 1 feeds to it. <br>“Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is,” Kahneman writes, “the automatic System 1 is the hero of this book.” System 2 is especially quiescent, it seems, when your mood is a happy one.<br><br>At this point, the skeptical reader might wonder how seriously to take all this talk of System 1 and System 2. <br>Are they actually a pair of little agents in our head, each with its distinctive personality? Not really, says Kahneman. <br>Rather, they are “useful fictions” — useful because they help explain the quirks of the human mind.<br><br>What to Expect at Work When You’re Expecting<br>To see how, consider what Kahneman calls the “best-known and most controversial” of the experiments he and Tversky did together: “the Linda problem.” Participants in the experiment were told about an imaginary young woman named Linda, who is single, outspoken and very bright, and who, as a student, was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice. <br>The participants were then asked which was more probable: (1) Linda is a bank teller. <br><br>Or (2) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. <br>The overwhelming response was that (2) was more probable; in other words, that given the background information furnished, “feminist bank teller” was more likely than “bank teller.” This is, of course, a blatant violation of the laws of probability. <br>(Every feminist bank teller is a bank teller; adding a detail can only lower the probability.) Yet even among students in Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, who had extensive training in probability, 85 percent flunked the Linda problem. <br><br>One student, informed that she had committed an elementary logical blunder, responded, “I thought you just asked for my opinion.”<br>What has gone wrong here? An easy question (how coherent is the narrative?) is substituted for a more difficult one (how probable is it?). <br>And this, according to Kahneman, is the source of many of the biases that infect our thinking. <br><br>System 1 jumps to an intuitive conclusion based on a “heuristic” — an easy but imperfect way of answering hard questions — and System 2 lazily endorses this heuristic answer without bothering to scrutinize whether it is logical.<br>Image<br>Credit...Illustration by David Plunkert<br><br>Kahneman describes dozens of such experimentally demonstrated breakdowns in rationality — “base-rate neglect,” “availability cascade,” “the illusion of validity” and so on. <br>The cumulative effect is to make the reader despair for human reason.<br>Are we really so hopeless? Think again of the Linda problem. <br><br>Even the great evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould was troubled by it. <br>As an expert in probability he knew the right answer, yet he wrote that “a little homunculus in my head continues to jump up and down, shouting at me — ‘But she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description.’ ” It was Gould’s System 1, Kahneman assures us, that kept shouting the wrong answer at him. <br>But perhaps something more subtle is going on. <br><br>Our everyday conversation takes place against a rich background of unstated expectations — what linguists call “implicatures.” Such implicatures can seep into psychological experiments. <br>Given the expectations that facilitate our conversation, it may have been quite reasonable for the participants in the experiment to take “Linda is a bank clerk” to imply that she was not in addition a feminist. <br>If so, their answers weren’t really fallacious.<br><br>This might seem a minor point. <br>But it applies to several of the biases that Kahneman and Tversky, along with other investigators, purport to have discovered in formal experiments. <br>In more natural settings — when we are detecting cheaters rather than solving logic puzzles; when we are reasoning about things rather than symbols; when we are assessing raw numbers rather than percentages — people are far less likely to make the same errors. <br><br>So, at least, much subsequent research suggests. <br>Maybe we are not so irrational after all.<br>Some cognitive biases, of course, are flagrantly exhibited even in the most natural of settings. <br><br>Take what Kahneman calls the “planning fallacy”: our tendency to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, and hence foolishly to take on risky projects. <br>In 2002, Americans remodeling their kitchens, for example, expected the job to cost $18,658 on average, but they ended up paying $38,769.<br>The planning fallacy is “only one of the manifestations of a pervasive optimistic bias,” Kahneman writes, which “may well be the most significant of the cognitive biases.” Now, in one sense, a bias toward optimism is obviously bad, since it generates false beliefs — like the belief that we are in control, and not the playthings of luck. <br><br>But without this “illusion of control,” would we even be able to get out of bed in the morning? Optimists are more psychologically resilient, have stronger immune systems, and live longer on average than their more reality-based counterparts. <br>Moreover, as Kahneman notes, exaggerated optimism serves to protect both individuals and organizations from the paralyzing effects of another bias, “loss aversion”: our tendency to fear losses more than we value gains. <br>It was exaggerated optimism that John Maynard Keynes had in mind when he talked of the “animal spirits” that drive capitalism.<br><br>Even if we could rid ourselves of the biases and illusions identified in this book — and Kahneman, citing his own lack of progress in overcoming them, doubts that we can — it is by no means clear that this would make our lives go better. <br>And that raises a fundamental question: What is the point of rationality? We are, after all, Darwinian survivors. <br>Our everyday reasoning abilities have evolved to cope efficiently with a complex and dynamic environment. <br><br>They are thus likely to be adaptive in this environment, even if they can be tripped up in the psychologist’s somewhat artificial experiments. <br>Where do the norms of rationality come from, if they are not an idealization of the way humans actually reason in their ordinary lives? As a species, we can no more be pervasively biased in our judgments than we can be pervasively ungrammatical in our use of language — or so critics of research like Kahneman and Tversky’s contend.<br>Kahneman never grapples philosophically with the nature of rationality. <br><br>He does, however, supply a fascinating account of what might be taken to be its goal: happiness. <br>What does it mean to be happy? When Kahneman first took up this question, in the mid 1990s, most happiness research relied on asking people how satisfied they were with their life on the whole. <br>But such retrospective assessments depend on memory, which is notoriously unreliable. <br><br>What if, instead, a person’s actual experience of pleasure or pain could be sampled from moment to moment, and then summed up over time? Kahneman calls this “experienced” well-being, as opposed to the “remembered” well-being that researchers had relied upon. <br>And he found that these two measures of happiness diverge in surprising ways. <br>What makes the “experiencing self” happy is not the same as what makes the “remembering self” happy. <br><br>In particular, the remembering self does not care about duration — how long a pleasant or unpleasant experience lasts. <br>Rather, it retrospectively rates an experience by the peak level of pain or pleasure in the course of the experience, and by the way the experience ends.<br>These two quirks of remembered happiness — “duration neglect” and the “peak-end rule” — were strikingly illustrated in one of Kahneman’s more harrowing experiments. <br><br>Two groups of patients were to undergo painful colonoscopies. <br>The patients in Group A got the normal procedure. <br>So did the patients in Group B, except — without their being told — a few extra minutes of mild discomfort were added after the end of the examination. <br><br>Which group suffered more? Well, Group B endured all the pain that Group A did, and then some. <br>But since the prolonging of Group B’s colonoscopies meant that the procedure ended less painfully, the patients in this group retrospectively minded it less. <br>(In an earlier research paper though not in this book, Kahneman suggested that the extra discomfort Group B was subjected to in the experiment might be ethically justified if it increased their willingness to come back for a follow-up!)<br><br>As with colonoscopies, so too with life. <br>It is the remembering self that calls the shots, not the experiencing self. <br>Kahneman cites research showing, for example, that a college student’s decision whether or not to repeat a spring-break vacation is determined by the peak-end rule applied to the previous vacation, not by how fun (or miserable) it actually was moment by moment. <br><br>The remembering self exercises a sort of “tyranny” over the voiceless experiencing self. <br>“Odd as it may seem,” Kahneman writes, “I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.”<br>Kahneman’s conclusion, radical as it sounds, may not go far enough. <br><br>There may be no experiencing self at all. <br>Brain-scanning experiments by Rafael Malach and his colleagues at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, for instance, have shown that when subjects are absorbed in an experience, like watching the “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,” the parts of the brain associated with self-consciousness are not merely quiet, they’re actually shut down (“inhibited”) by the rest of the brain. <br>The self seems simply to disappear. <br><br>Then who exactly is enjoying the film? And why should such egoless pleasures enter into the decision calculus of the remembering self?<br>Clearly, much remains to be done in hedonic psychology. <br>But Kahneman’s conceptual innovations have laid the foundation for many of the empirical findings he reports in this book: that while French mothers spend less time with their children than American mothers, they enjoy it more; that headaches are hedonically harder on the poor; that women who live alone seem to enjoy the same level of well-being as women who live with a mate; and that a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas of the country is sufficient to maximize happiness. <br><br>Policy makers interested in lowering the misery index of society will find much to ponder here.<br>By the time I got to the end of “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” my skeptical frown had long since given way to a grin of intellectual satisfaction. <br>Appraising the book by the peak-end rule, I overconfidently urge everyone to buy and read it. <br><br>But for those who are merely interested in Kahneman’s takeaway on the Malcolm Gladwell question it is this: If you’ve had 10,000 hours of training in a predictable, rapid-feedback environment — chess, firefighting, anesthesiology — then blink. <br>In all other cases, think.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmjgZF2HEwI" class="whitebut ">Thinking Fast and Slow | Daniel Kahneman</a><br><a href="http://dspace.vnbrims.org:13000/jspui/bitstream/123456789/2224/1/Daniel-Kahneman-Thinking-Fast-and-Slow-.pdf" class="whitebut ">Thinking Fast and Slow PDF</a><br>',
