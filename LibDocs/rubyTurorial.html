<h2>Interactive Ruby</h2>
Ruby comes with a program that will show the results of any Ruby statements you feed it. Playing with Ruby code in interactive sessions like this is a terrific way to learn the language.

Open up IRB (which stands for Interactive Ruby).

<ul>
<li>If you’re using <strong>macOS</strong> open up <code>Terminal</code> and type <code>irb</code>, then hit enter.</li>
<li>If you’re using <strong>Linux</strong>, open up a shell and type <code>irb</code> and hit enter.</li>
<li>If you’re using <strong>Windows</strong>, open <code>Interactive Ruby</code> from the Ruby section of your Start Menu.</li>
</ul>
<code>irb(main):001:0></code>
Ok, so it’s open. Now what?
Type this: <code>"Hello World"</code>

<code>irb(main):001:0> "Hello World"
=> "Hello World"</code>
<h2>Ruby Obeyed You!</h2>

What just happened? Did we just write the world’s shortest “Hello World” program? Not exactly. The second line is just IRB’s way of telling us the result of the last expression it evaluated. If we want to print out “Hello World” we need a bit more:

<code>irb(main):002:0> puts "Hello World"
Hello World
=> nil</code>
<code>puts</code> is the basic command to print something out in Ruby. But then what’s the <code>=> nil</code> bit? That’s the result of the expression. <code>puts</code> always returns nil, which is Ruby’s absolutely-positively-nothing value.

<h2>Your Free Calculator is Here</h2>

Already, we have enough to use IRB as a basic calculator:

<code>irb(main):003:0> 3+2
=> 5</code>
Three plus two. Easy enough. What about three <em>times</em> two? You could type it in, it’s short enough, but you may also be able to go up and change what you just entered. Try hitting the <strong>up-arrow</strong> on your keyboard and see if it brings up the line with <code>3+2</code> on it. If it does, you can use the left arrow key to move just after the <code>+</code> sign and then use backspace to change it to a <code>*</code> sign.

<code>irb(main):004:0> 3*2
=> 6</code>
Next, let’s try three squared:

<code>irb(main):005:0> 3**2
=> 9</code>
In Ruby <code>**</code> is the way you say “to the power of”. But what if you want to go the other way and find the square root of something?

<code>irb(main):006:0> Math.sqrt(9)
=> 3.0</code>
Ok, wait, what was that last one? If you guessed, “it was figuring out the square root of nine,” you’re right. But let’s take a closer look at things. First of all, what’s <code>Math</code>?

<h2><br>Modules Group Code by Topic</h2>

<code>Math</code> is a built-in module for mathematics. Modules serve two roles in
Ruby. This shows one role: grouping similar methods together under a familiar name. <code>Math</code> also contains methods like <code>sin()</code> and <code>tan()</code>.

Next is a dot. What does the dot do? The dot is how you identify the receiver of a message. What’s the message? In this case it’s <code>sqrt(9)</code>, which means call the method <code>sqrt</code>, shorthand for “square root” with the parameter of <code>9</code>.

The result of this method call is the value <code>3.0</code>. You might notice it’s not just <code>3</code>. That’s because most of the time the square root of a number won’t be an integer, so the method always returns a floating-point number.

What if we want to remember the result of some of this math? Assign the result to a variable.

<code>irb(main):007:0> a = 3 ** 2
=> 9
irb(main):008:0> b = 4 ** 2
=> 16
irb(main):009:0> Math.sqrt(a+b)
=> 5.0</code>
As great as this is for a calculator, we’re getting away from the traditional <code>Hello World</code> message that beginning tutorials are supposed to focus on… so let’s go back to that.</a>

What if we want to say “Hello” a lot without getting our fingers all tired? We need to define a method!

<code>irb(main):010:0> def hi
irb(main):011:1> puts "Hello World!"
irb(main):012:1> end
=> :hi</code>
The code <code>def hi</code> starts the definition of the method. It tells Ruby that we’re defining a method, that its name is <code>hi</code>. The next line is the body of the method, the same line we saw earlier: <code>puts "Hello World"</code>.
Finally, the last line <code>end</code> tells Ruby we’re done defining the method.
Ruby’s response <code>=> :hi</code> tells us that it knows we’re done defining the method. This response could be <code>=> nil</code> for Ruby 2.0 and earlier versions.
But, it’s not important here, so let’s go on.

<h2>The Brief, Repetitive Lives of a Method</h2>
Now let’s try running that method a few times:

<code>irb(main):013:0> hi
Hello World!
=> nil
irb(main):014:0> hi()
Hello World!
=> nil</code>
Well, that was easy. Calling a method in Ruby is as easy as just mentioning its name to Ruby. If the method doesn’t take parameters that’s all you need. You can add empty parentheses if you’d like, but they’re not needed.

What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world?
Just redefine <code>hi</code> to take a name as a parameter.

<code>irb(main):015:0> def hi(name)
irb(main):016:1> puts "Hello #{name}!"
irb(main):017:1> end
=> :hi
irb(main):018:0> hi("Matz")
Hello Matz!
=> nil</code>
So it works… but let’s take a second to see what’s going on here.

<h2><br>Holding Spots in a String</h2>

What’s the <code>#{name}</code> bit? That’s Ruby’s way of inserting something into a string. The bit between the braces is turned into a string (if it isn’t one already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to make sure that someone’s name is properly capitalized:

<code>irb(main):019:0> def hi(name = "World")
irb(main):020:1> puts "Hello #{name.capitalize}!"
irb(main):021:1> end
=> :hi
irb(main):022:0> hi "chris"
Hello Chris!
=> nil
irb(main):023:0> hi
Hello World!
=> nil</code>
A couple of other tricks to spot here. One is that we’re calling the method without parentheses again. If it’s obvious what you’re doing, the parentheses are optional. The other trick is the default parameter <code>World</code>. What this is saying is “If the name isn’t supplied, use the default name of <code>"World"</code>”.

<h2>Evolving Into a Greeter</h2>

What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and welcomes you and treats you always with respect. You might want to use an object for that. Let’s create a “Greeter” class.

<code>irb(main):024:0> class Greeter
irb(main):025:1>   def initialize(name = "World")
irb(main):026:2>     @name = name
irb(main):027:2>   end
irb(main):028:1>   def say_hi
irb(main):029:2>     puts "Hi #{@name}!"
irb(main):030:2>   end
irb(main):031:1>   def say_bye
irb(main):032:2>     puts "Bye #{@name}, come back soon."
irb(main):033:2>   end
irb(main):034:1> end
=> :say_bye</code>
The new keyword here is <code>class</code>. This defines a new class called Greeter and a bunch of methods for that class. Also notice <code>@name</code>. This is an instance variable, and is available to all the methods of the class. As you can see it’s used by <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code>.

So how do we get this Greeter class set in motion?
<a href="../3/">Create an object.</a>

Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:

<code>irb(main):035:0> greeter = Greeter.new("Pat")
=> #&lt;Greeter:0x16cac @name="Pat">
irb(main):036:0> greeter.say_hi
Hi Pat!
=> nil
irb(main):037:0> greeter.say_bye
Bye Pat, come back soon.
=> nil</code>
Once the <code>greeter</code> object is created, it remembers that the name is Pat. Hmm, what if we want to get at the name directly?

<code>irb(main):038:0> greeter.@name
SyntaxError: (irb):38: syntax error, unexpected tIVAR, expecting '('</code>
Nope, can’t do it.

<h2>Under the Object’s Skin</h2>

Instance variables are hidden away inside the object. They’re not terribly hidden, you see them whenever you inspect the object, and there are other ways of accessing them, but Ruby uses the good object-oriented approach of keeping data sort-of hidden away.

So what methods do exist for Greeter objects?

<code>irb(main):039:0> Greeter.instance_methods
=> [:say_hi, :say_bye, :instance_of?, :public_send,
:instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set,
:instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable,
:private_methods, :kind_of?, :instance_variables, :tap,
:is_a?, :extend, :define_singleton_method, :to_enum,
:enum_for, :&lt;=>, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :respond_to?,
:freeze, :inspect, :display, :send, :object_id, :to_s,
:method, :public_method, :singleton_method, :nil?, :hash,
:class, :singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :itself, :taint,
:tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :trust, :untrusted?, :methods,
:protected_methods, :frozen?, :public_methods, :singleton_methods,
:!, :==, :!=, :__send__, :equal?, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, :__id__]</code>
Whoa. That’s a lot of methods. We only defined two methods. What’s going on here? Well this is <strong>all</strong> of the methods for Greeter objects, a complete list, including ones defined by ancestor classes. If we want to just list methods defined for Greeter we can tell it to not include ancestors by passing it the parameter <code>false</code>, meaning we don’t want methods defined by ancestors.

<code>irb(main):040:0> Greeter.instance_methods(false)
=> [:say_hi, :say_bye]</code>
Ah, that’s more like it. So let’s see which methods our greeter object responds to:

<code>irb(main):041:0> greeter.respond_to?("name")
=> false
irb(main):042:0> greeter.respond_to?("say_hi")
=> true
irb(main):043:0> greeter.respond_to?("to_s")
=> true</code>
So, it knows <code>say_hi</code>, and <code>to_s</code> (meaning convert something to a string, a method that’s defined by default for every object), but it doesn’t know <code>name</code>. 
<h2><br>Altering Classes—It’s Never Too Late</h2>

But what if you want to be able to view or change the name? Ruby provides an easy way of providing access to an object’s variables.

<code>irb(main):044:0> class Greeter
irb(main):045:1>   attr_accessor :name
irb(main):046:1> end
=> nil</code>
In Ruby, you can reopen a class and modify it. The changes will be present in any new objects you create and even available in existing objects of that class. So, let’s create a new object and play with its <code>@name</code> property. 
<code>irb(main):047:0> greeter = Greeter.new("Andy")
=> #&lt;Greeter:0x3c9b0 @name="Andy">
irb(main):048:0> greeter.respond_to?("name")
=> true
irb(main):049:0> greeter.respond_to?("name=")
=> true
irb(main):050:0> greeter.say_hi
Hi Andy!
=> nil
irb(main):051:0> greeter.name="Betty"
=> "Betty"
irb(main):052:0> greeter
=> #&lt;Greeter:0x3c9b0 @name="Betty">
irb(main):053:0> greeter.name
=> "Betty"
irb(main):054:0> greeter.say_hi
Hi Betty!
=> nil</code>
Using <code>attr_accessor</code> defined two new methods for us, <code>name</code> to get the value, and <code>name=</code> to set it.

<h2><br>Greeting Anything and Everything, MegaGreeter Neglects None!</h2>

This greeter isn’t all that interesting though, it can only deal with one person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? 
Let’s write this one in a file instead of directly in the interactive Ruby interpreter IRB.

To quit IRB, type “quit”, “exit” or just hit Control-D.

<code data-lang="ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

class MegaGreeter
attr_accessor :names

# Create the object
def initialize(names = "World")
@names = names
end

# Say hi to everybody
def say_hi
if @names.nil?
puts "..."
elsif @names.respond_to?("each")
# @names is a list of some kind, iterate!
@names.each do |name|
 puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
else
puts "Hello #{@names}!"
end
end

# Say bye to everybody
def say_bye
if @names.nil?
puts "..."
elsif @names.respond_to?("join")
# Join the list elements with commas
puts "Goodbye #{@names.join(", ")}.  Come back soon!"
else
puts "Goodbye #{@names}.  Come back soon!"
end
end
end


if __FILE__ == $0
mg = MegaGreeter.new
mg.say_hi
mg.say_bye

# Change name to be "Zeke"
mg.names = "Zeke"
mg.say_hi
mg.say_bye

# Change the name to an array of names
mg.names = ["Albert", "Brenda", "Charles",
       "Dave", "Engelbert"]
mg.say_hi
mg.say_bye

# Change to nil
mg.names = nil
mg.say_hi
mg.say_bye
end</code>
Save this file as “ri20min.rb”, and run it as “ruby ri20min.rb”. The output should be:

<div><div><code>Hello World!
Goodbye World.  Come back soon!
Hello Zeke!
Goodbye Zeke.  Come back soon!
Hello Albert!
Hello Brenda!
Hello Charles!
Hello Dave!
Hello Engelbert!
Goodbye Albert, Brenda, Charles, Dave, Engelbert.  Come
back soon!
...
...
</code>
</div></div>

There are a lot of new things thrown into this final example that we can take a deeper look at.


So, looking deeper at our new program, notice the initial lines, which begin with a hash mark (#). In Ruby, anything on a line after a hash mark is a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. The first line of the file is a special case, and under a Unix-like operating system tells the shell how to run the file. The rest of the comments are there just for clarity. 
Our <code>say_hi</code> method has become a bit trickier:

<code data-lang="ruby"># Say hi to everybody
def say_hi
if @names.nil?
puts "..."
elsif @names.respond_to?("each")
# @names is a list of some kind, iterate!
@names.each do |name|
puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
else
puts "Hello #{@names}!"
end
end</code>
It now looks at the <code>@names</code> instance variable to make decisions. If it’s nil, it just prints out three dots. No point greeting nobody, right?

<h2><br>Cycling and Looping—a.k.a. Iteration</h2>

If the <code>@names</code> object responds to <code>each</code>, it is something that you can iterate over, so iterate over it and greet each person in turn. Finally, if <code>@names</code> is anything else, just let it get turned into a string automatically and do the default greeting. 
Let’s look at that iterator in more depth:

<code data-lang="ruby">@names.each do |name|
puts "Hello #{name}!"
end</code>
<code>each</code> is a method that accepts a block of code then runs that block of code for every element in a list, and the bit between <code>do</code> and <code>end</code> is just such a block. 
A block is like an anonymous function or <code>lambda</code>. 
The variable between pipe characters is the parameter for this block. 
What happens here is that for every entry in a list, <code>name</code> is bound to that list element, and then the expression <code>puts "Hello #{name}!"</code> is run with that name. 

Most other programming languages handle going over a list using the
<code>for</code> loop, which in C looks something like:

<code data-lang="c">for (i=0; i&lt;number_of_elements; i++)
{
do_something_with(element[i]);
}</code>
This works, but isn’t very elegant. 
You need a throw-away variable like <code>i</code>, have to figure out how long the list is, and have to explain how to walk over the list. 
The Ruby way is much more elegant, all the housekeeping details are hidden within the <code>each</code> method, all you need to do is to tell it what to do with each element. 
Internally, the <code>each</code> method will essentially call <code>yield "Albert"</code>, then <code>yield "Brenda"</code> and then <code>yield "Charles"</code>, and so on. 

<h2>Blocks, the Highly Sparkling Glint on the Edge of Ruby</h2>

The real power of blocks is when dealing with things that are more complicated than lists. Beyond handling simple housekeeping details within the method, you can also handle setup, teardown, and errors—all hidden away from the cares of the user. 
<code data-lang="ruby"># Say bye to everybody
def say_bye
if @names.nil?
puts "..."
elsif @names.respond_to?("join")
# Join the list elements with commas
puts "Goodbye #{@names.join(", ")}.  Come back soon!"
else
puts "Goodbye #{@names}.  Come back soon!"
end
end</code>
The <code>say_bye</code> method doesn’t use <code>each</code>, instead it checks to see if <code>@names</code> responds to the <code>join</code> method, and if so, uses it. 
Otherwise, it just prints out the variable as a string. 
This method of not caring about the actual <em>type</em> of a variable, just relying on what methods it supports is known as “Duck Typing”, as in “if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck…”. 
The benefit of this is that it doesn’t unnecessarily restrict the types of variables that are supported. 
If someone comes up with a new kind of list class, as long as it implements the <code>join</code> method with the same semantics as other lists, everything will work as planned. 

<h2><br>Kicking Off the Script</h2>

So, that’s the MegaGreeter class, the rest of the file just calls methods on that class. There’s one final trick to notice, and that’s the line: 
<code data-lang="ruby">if __FILE__ == $0</code>
<code>__FILE__</code> is the magic variable that contains the name of the current file. 
<code>$0</code> is the name of the file used to start the program. 
This check says “If this is the main file being used…” This allows a file to be used as a library, and not to execute code in that context, but if the file is being used as an executable, then execute that code. 

<h2>Consider Yourself Introduced</h2>

So that’s it for the quick tour of Ruby. 
There’s a lot more to explore, the different control structures that Ruby offers; the use of blocks and <code>yield</code>; modules as mixins; and more. 
I hope this taste of Ruby has left you wanting to learn more. 
If so, please head on over to our <a href="/en/documentation/">Documentation</a> area, which rounds up links to manuals and tutorials, all freely available online. 

<h2><br><br>Sum Of Two Numbers</h2>
In this example we want to find out if given an array of unique numbers, there is a combination of two numbers which adds up to a target number.

<strong>Code</strong>:
def sum_eq_n?(arr, n)
 return true if arr.empty? && n == 0
 arr.product(arr).reject { |a,b| a == b }.any? { |a,b| a + b == n }
end

This is interesting because I&#8217;m using the <code>product</code> method here.

When you use this method is like having a loop inside a loop that combines all values in array A with all values in array B.

<h2>Counting, Mapping &amp; Finding</h2>
Let&#8217;s say that you want to find the missing number in an arithmetic sequence, like <code>(2,4,6,10)</code>.

We can use a strategy where we calculate the difference between the numbers.
[2, 2, 4]

Our goal here is to find out what the sequence is.

<strong>Is it increasing or decreasing?</strong>

<strong>By how much?</strong>

This code reveals the sequence:
differences = [2, 2, 4]
differences.max_by { |n| differences.count(n) }
# 2
# This is the increase between numbers in the sequence

Once we know the sequence we can compare all the numbers to find the missing one.

<strong>Here&#8217;s the code</strong>:

def find_missing(sequence)
 consecutive     = sequence.each_cons(2)
 differences     = consecutive.map { |a,b| b - a }
 sequence        = differences.max_by { |n| differences.count(n) }

 missing_between = consecutive.find { |a,b| (b - a) != sequence }

 missing_between.first + sequence
end

find_missing([2,4,6,10])
# 8

Count how many Ruby methods we&#8217;re using here to do the hard work for us 🙂

<h2><br>Regular Expression Example</h2>
If you are working with strings &amp; you want to find patterns then regular expressions are your friend.

They can be a bit tricky to get right, but practice makes mastery!

<strong>Now</strong>:
Let&#8217;s say that we want to find out if a given string follows a pattern of VOWEL to NON-VOWEL characters.

<strong>Like this</strong>:
"ateciyu"
Then we can use a regular expression, along with the <code>match?</code> method to figure this out.

<strong>Here&#8217;s the code example</strong>:

def alternating_characters?(s)
 type = [/[aeiou]/, /[^aeiou]/].cycle
 if s.start_with?(/[^aeiou]/)
   type.next
 end
 s.chars.all? { |ch| ch.match?(type.next) }
end

alternating_characters?("ateciyu")
# true

<strong>Notice a few things</strong>:
<li>We use the <code>cycle</code> method so we can keep switching between the VOWEL regex &amp; the NON-VOWEL regex.</li>
<li>We convert the string into an array of characters with <code>chars</code> so that we can use the <code>all?</code> method.</li>

<h2>Recursion &amp; Stack Example</h2>
Recursion is when a method calls itself multiple times as a way to make progress towards a solution.

Many interesting problems can be <strong>solved with recursion</strong>.
But because recursion has its limits, you can use a <a href="https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/03/computer-science-in-ruby-stacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stack data structure</a> instead.

<strong>Now</strong>:
Let&#8217;s look at an example where we want to find out the &#8220;Power Set&#8221; of a given array. The Power Set is a set of all the subsets that can be created from the array.

<strong>Here&#8217;s an example with recursion</strong>:

def get_numbers(list, index = 0, taken = [])
 return [taken] if index == list.size

 get_numbers(list, index+1, taken) +
 get_numbers(list, index+1, taken + [list[index]])
end

get_numbers([1,2,3])

<strong>Here&#8217;s the same problem solved using a stack</strong>:

def get_numbers_stack(list)
 stack  = [[0, []]]
 output = []

 until stack.empty?
   index, taken = stack.pop

   next output << taken if index == list.size

   stack.unshift [index + 1, taken]
   stack.unshift [index + 1, taken + [list[index]]]
 end

 output
end

The idea here is that on each pass of the algorithm we are either taking a number or not taking a number.

We branch out &amp; try both outcomes so we can <strong>produce all the possible combinations</strong>.

Imagine a tree where each leaf is one of the solutions.

<strong>A few things to notice</strong>:
<li>The recursion solution is shorter</li>
<li>The actual "making progress" part of the algorithm (index + 1) is almost the same</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/03/computer-science-in-ruby-stacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stack</a> we're using is just an array because there isn't a <code>Stack</code> class in Ruby</li>

<h2>Method Chaining Example</h2>
This is my favorite example because it shows how powerful Ruby is.

Combining methods allows you to <strong>take the output produced by one method &amp; pass it into another</strong>.

Just like a factory production line!

You start with some raw materials (<a href="https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/02/ruby-io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">input</a>), then through the process of calling these methods, you slowly transform the raw materials into the desired result.

<strong>Here's an example</strong>:

def longest_repetition(string)
 max = string
         .chars
         .chunk(&:itself)
         .map(&:last)
         .max_by(&:size)

 max ? [max[0], max.size] : ["", 0]
end

longest_repetition("aaabb")
# ["a", 3]

Given a string, this code will find the <strong>longest repeated character</strong>.

<strong>Note</strong>:
<li>How this code is formatted to maximize readability</li>
<li>Use of the <code>Symbol#to_proc</code> pattern (<code>&amp;:size</code>)</li>

Btw, don't confuse this with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oigVMMQ2woo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Law of Demeter"</a>.

That "law" is about reaching out into the internals of another object.

Here we are only transforming objects.

<h2><br>With Index Example</h2>
Would you like to have the current index while iterating over a collection of items?

You can use the <code>with_index</code> method.

<strong>Here's an example</strong>:
def reverse_alternate(string)
 string.gsub(/[^\s]+/).with_index { |w, idx| idx.even? ? w : w.reverse }
end

reverse_alternate("Apples Are Good")
# "Apples erA Good"

<strong>Notice</strong>:
<li>We combine <code>with_index</code> &amp; <code>even?</code> to find if we have to reverse the current word</li>
<li>Gsub without a block returns an <code>Enumerator</code> object, which allows you to chain it with other methods</li>

<h2>Each With Object Example</h2>
Another interesting method is <code>each_with_object</code>, and its friend <code>with_object</code>.
You can use these two methods when you need an object to hold the results.

<strong>Here's an example</strong>:
def clean_string(str)
 str
   .chars
   .each_with_object([]) { |ch, obj| ch == "#" ? obj.pop : obj << ch }
   .join
end

clean_string("aaa#b")

In this example, we want to delete the last character when we find a <code>#</code> symbol.

<strong>Notice</strong>:
<li><code>each_with_object</code> takes an argument, which is the object we want to start with. This argument becomes the 2nd block parameter.</li>
<li>We are converting the string into an array of characters (<code>char</code>) &amp; then back to a string when we are done (<code>join</code>).</li>
<li>We are using a ternary operator to decide what to do, this makes the code shorter.</li>
<h2><br></h2>
<h2><br>Ruby Hello, World!</h2>
print "Hello, World!\n"

The Ruby Hello, World! program is a one-liner.

C-like (really perl-like) string constant
No semicolon needed (though it wouldn't break anything).

# Variables and expressions.
a = 10
b = 3 * a + 2
printf("%d %d\n", a, b);

# Type is dynamic.
b = "A string"
c = 'Another String'
print b + " and " + c + "\n"

The variables shown in this example are "local variables".
(We'll explore other possibilities later.)  

Names are mostly conventional: letters, underscore, and digit, not starting with a digit.  
<i>Local variables must start with a lower-case letter.</i>

Variable types are dynamic:  Assignment transfers both and type, not just value.  
Variables are not declared with a type, and assignment does not need to perform conversion.

Obviously, the <code>+</code> concatenates strings, as in Java and C++.

The <code>printf</code> function is lifted from plain C.

<h2>Objects</h2>
# Operators are really method invocations.
a = 10
b = 3.*(a).+(2)
Kernel::printf("%d %d\n", a, b);

# Type is still dynamic.
b = String.new("A string")
c = 'Another String'
Kernel.print(b.+(" and ")::+(c).+("\n"))

Here is a more honest version of the last example.  
Ruby 
is a fairly pure object-oriented language, which borrows a good bit from Smalltalk.  
Pretty much everything is an object.

Ruby has a bit more complex syntax than Smalltalk, some of it designed to make much of Ruby look more conventional.  
But it's 
invoking methods on objects just the same.

For instance, ordinary integers are objects of the class
<code>Fixnum</code>.  
The numeric operations are methods.  
Ruby lets you write <code>3 * a</code>, but what you're really doing is invoking the <code>*</code>
method on the object <code>3</code>, and you can write it that way
<code>3.*(a)</code>.

The name <code>Kernel</code> refers to a built-in module.  
A module is similar to a static class in Java.  
The builtin-in functions <code>print</code> and
<code>printf</code> are part of <code>Kernel</code>.
As far as I can tell, the <code>::</code> and <code>.</code> operators are equivalent.

Of course, string constants are objects of class <code>String</code>, and this is made explicit in the statement <code>b = String.new("A String");</code>.
Notice that <code>new</code> is a method of class <code>String</code>, rather than being an operator as in Java and C++.

We'll usually use the more conventional syntax, but the heavy use of objects provides gread flexibilty.  
We'll flex later.

Also note that there is no sense of Java's wrapper classes, 
like <code>Integer</code>.  
When you write an integer constant, it's an object of
Ruby's <code>Integer</code> class.  
There is no <code>int</code>.

<h2>Strings</h2>
# Double-quoted strings can substitute variables.
a = 17
print "a = #{a}\n";
print 'a = #{a}\n';

print "\n";

# If you're verbose, you can create a multi-line string like this.
b = &lt;&lt;ENDER
This is a longer string,
perhaps some instructions or agreement goes here.  
By the way,
a = #{a}.
ENDER

print "\n[[[" + b + "]]]\n";

print "\nActually, any string can span lines.  
The line\nbreaks just become part of the string.
"

print %Q=\nThe highly intuitive "%Q" prefix allows alternative delimiters.\n=
print %Q[Bracket symbols match their mates, not themselves.\n]

Ruby has many ways of making strings, which are generally variations of the many ways perl has of making strings.
Double quotes allow values to be interpolated into the string,
while single quotes do not.  
Most escapes are treated literally in single quotes, including the fact that <code>\n</code> is treated as two characters, a backward slash followed by an n.

Ruby strings may extend any number of lines.  
This can be useful,
but make sure you don't leave out any closing quotes.

The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> notation follows perl and other languages as a way to multi-line strings.  
Those don't generally permit the other varieties to specify multi-line strings, so it's actually kind of redundant in Ruby.

The <code>%</code> can be used to create strings using a different 
delimiter.  
<code>%Q</code><i>x</i> starts a double-quote style string which ends with the next <i>x</i>, rather than the usual double quote character.  
<code>%q</code><i>y</i> starts a single-quote string.

<h2>String Operations</h2>
s = "Hi there.  
How are you?"
print s.length, " [" + s + "]\n"

# Selecting a character in a string gives an integer ascii code.
print s[4], "\n"
printf("%c\n", s[4])

# The [n,l] substring gives the starting position and length.  
The [n..m]
# form gives a range of positions, inclusive.
print "[" + s[4,4] + "] [" + s[6..15] + "]\n"

print "Wow " * 3, "\n"

print s.index("there"), " ", s.index("How"), " ", s.index("bogus"), "\n"

print s.reverse, "\n"

<h2>Arrays</h2>
a = [ 45, 3, 19, 8 ]
b = [ 'sam', 'max', 56, 98.9, 3, 10, 'jill' ]
print (a + b).join(' '), "\n"
print a[2], " ", b[4], " ", b[-2], "\n"
print a.sort.join(' '), "\n"
a &lt;&lt; 57 &lt;&lt; 9 &lt;&lt; 'phil'
print "A: ", a.join(' '), "\n"

b &lt;&lt; 'alex' &lt;&lt; 48 &lt;&lt; 220
print "B: ", b.join(' '), "\n"
print "pop: ", b.pop, "\n"
print "shift: ", b.shift, "\n"
print "C: ", b.join(' '), "\n"

b.delete_at(2)
b.delete('alex')
print "D: ", b.join(' '), "\n"

Ruby arrays have operations similar to strings.
As the quote notation creates a String object, the bracket notation creates an Array object.

<h2>Hashes</h2>
z = { 'mike' =&gt; 75, 'bill' =&gt; 18, 'alice' =&gt; 32 }
z['joe'] = 44
print z['bill'], " ", z['joe'], " ", z["smith"], "\n"
print z.has_key?('mike'), " ", z.has_key?("jones"), "\n"

Ruby hashes are similar to maps or dictionaries in other languages.  
They are 
essentially arrays whose subscripts are not limited to integer values.
You can create them with the curly-bracked list notation shown, but you can also assign to a subscript expression to add members.  
It's not at all unreasonable to create a hash with empty brackets, then add members using subscripting.

Method names may end in <code>?</code>, hence the name of the
<code>has_key?</code> method.  
This suggests a the method is a test which returns a boolean value.  
Such methods are sometimes known as predicates.

<h2>Line Breaking</h2>
a = 10
b = a +
       10
c = [ 5, 4, 
       10 ]
d = [ a ] \
       + c print "#{a} #{b} [", c.join(" "), "] [", d.join(" "), "]\n";

Ruby generally uses line breaks instead of semicolons to separate statements.  
Lines can be continued by using a \ at the end, but this is rarely needed.  
If the line ends with pretty much anything that suggests there should be more, Ruby will continue on to the next line.  
This includes such things as ending with an operator, or inside parentheses or something else which needs to be closed.

<h2>Basic I/O I</h2>
# Get the parts of speech print "Please enter a past-tense verb: "
verb = gets.chomp print "Please enter a noun: "
noun = gets.chomp print "Please enter a proper noun: "
prop_noun = gets.chomp print "Please enter a an adverb: "
adv = gets.chomp

# Make the sentence.
print "#{prop_noun} got a #{noun} and\n#{verb} #{adv} around the block.\n"

<div class="ref">
<span class="rpre">See:</span>Ruby Manual 
</div>

The built-in <code>gets</code> function simply reads a line and returns it as a string.  
The <code>chomp</code> method from

trims the line terminator.
The prompts are generated with ordinary prints lacking a final newline.

<h2>Basic I/O II</h2>
print "Triangle height: "
h = gets.to_f;
print "Triangle width: "
w = gets.to_f;
area = 0.5*h*w print "Triangle height ", h, " width ", w, " has area ", area, "\n"

<div class="ref">
<span class="rpre">See:</span>Ruby Manual 
</div>

Similar to the last one, the <code>to_f</code> method of 

converts the input string to a floating-point number.  

<h2>File I/O</h2>
# Get the parts of speech.
print "Please enter a past-tense verb: "
verb = gets.chomp print "Please enter a noun: "
noun = gets.chomp print "Please enter a proper noun: "
prop_noun = gets.chomp print "Please enter a an adverb: "
adv = gets.chomp

# See where to put it.
print "Please enter a file name: "
fn = gets.chomp handle = open(fn,"w")

# Go.
printf(handle, "%s got a %s and\n%s %s around the block.\n",
       prop_noun, noun, verb, adv)
handle.close

<div class="ref">
<span class="rpre">See:</span>Ruby Manual

This version opens a file for writing, and writes its 
output to a file selected by the user.
The second argument to <code>open</code> is the same as the second argument to a plain C <code>fopen</code>, except it will default to reading.

The object returned from <code>open</code> is 
.


<h2>Parallel Asst.</h2>
# Assign three values.
a, b, c = 8, 10, 15
print "A: a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n"

# Compute three values, then assign three values.
a, b, c = 40, a + 11, a + b + c print "B: a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n"

# Swap.
a, b = b, a print "C: a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n"

# Extras on left get nil.
a, b, c = 2, 3
print "D: a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n"

# Extras on right get left behind a, b, c = 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
print "E: a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n"

# The right can be an array, in which case the members are assigned to
# individual variables.
fred = [ 4, 5, 6, 7]
a, b, c = fred print "F: a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n"

A parallel assignment sets several variables at once.  
All right sides are computed before any variable is assigned, so all right side values are computed with the old variable values.  
This is very convenient for swapping two values without using a temporary.

When the right side is an array, the members of the array are broken out and assigned to individual variables.

<h2>Conditional I</h2>
# Pick a random number.
rno = rand(100) + 1
print "Your magic number is ", rno, "\n"

# Perform all sort of totally uselss test on it and report the results.
if rno % 2 == 1 then
   print "Ooooh, that's an odd number.\n"
else
   print "That's an even number.\n"
   if rno &gt; 2 then
       print "It's not prime, BTW.\n"
   end end

if rno &gt; 50 
   print "That's more than half as big as it could be!\n"
elsif rno == 42
   print "That's the ultimate magic number!!!!\n"
elsif rno &lt; 10
   print "That's pretty small, actually.\n"
else
   print "What a boring number.\n"
end

if rno == 100 then print "Gosh, you've maxxed out!\n" end

This is the conventional use of the <code>if</code> in perl.
Notice that there is no need for curly braces (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>).
The body of the <code>if</code> ends with the appropriate keyword, 
<code>end</code>, <code>else</code> or <code>elsif</code>.
The <code>then</code> word is generally optional, though you need it if you want to put start the body on the same line as the <code>if</code>,
the way the last statement does.

As in most languages (excluding Python), indenting is not required,
and is ignored by the interpreter.  
Of course, it is wise to indent in a way which reflects the structure of the code.

<h2>Conditional II</h2>
# Let the user guess.
print "Enter heads or tails? "
hort = gets.chomp unless hort == 'heads' || hort == 'tails' 
   print "I _said_ heads or tails.  
Can't you read?\n"
   exit(1)
end

# Now toss the coin.
toss = if rand(2) == 1 then
   "heads"
else
   "tails"
end

# Report.
print "Toss was ", toss, ".\n"
print "You Win!\n" if hort == toss

Some more amazing <code>if</code> lore:
<ol class="std">
The <code>unless</code> keyword is like <code>if</code>, but uses the opposite sense of the test: The code is run if the test is false.

As with many things in Ruby, <code>if</code> may look like a statement,
but it is actually an expression, with a return value.
The <code>if</code> has a postfix form where the condition comes last.
This works with <code>unless</code> as well.
</ol>

<h2>While Loop</h2>
# Some counting with a while.
a = 0
while a &lt; 15
   print a, " "
   if a == 10 then
       print "made it to ten!!"
   end
   a = a + 1
end print "\n"

# Here's a way to empty an array.
joe = [ 'eggs.', 'some', 'break', 'to', 'Have' ]
print(joe.pop, " ") while joe.size &gt; 0
print "\n"

The <code>while</code> loop is conventional, but it also has a postfix form.

<h2>For Loop</h2>
# Simple for loop using a range.
for i in (1..4)
   print i," "
end print "\n"

for i in (1...4)
   print i," "
end print "\n"

# Running through a list (which is what they do).
items = [ 'Mark', 12, 'goobers', 18.45 ]
for it in items
   print it, " "
end print "\n"

# Go through the legal subscript values of an array.
for i in (0...items.length)
   print items[0..i].join(" "), "\n"
end

The Ruby <code>for</code> loop is similar to the Python <code>for</code> or the perl <code>foreach</code>.
Its basic operation is iterate over the contents of some 
collection.  
This may be an actual array or a range expression.
A range expression is two numbers, surrounded by parens, and separated by either two dots or three.  
The three-dot form omits the last number from the range, while the two-dot version includes it.  
The three-dots version can be quite useful for creating a range of legal subscripts since the array size is not a legal subscript. 

<h2>Case Expression</h2>
for i in (1..10)
   rno = rand(100) + 1
   msg = case rno
       when 42: "The ultimate result."
       when 1..10: "Way too small."
       when 11..15,19,27: "Sorry, too small"
       when 80..99: "Way to large"
       when 100:
               print "TOPS\n"
               "Really way too large"
       else "Just wrong"
   end
   print "Result: ", rno, ": ", msg, "\n"
end

The ruby <code>case</code> statement is similar to the C/C++/Java <code>switch</code>, but more directly related to the similar (and superior)
structures from Pascal and Ada.  

First, it assumes that each case ends where the next one starts, without needing a <code>break</code> to terminate a case.  
Secondly, each case can be 
expressed rather generally, with a single value, a range of value, or a list containing some of each.

For this example, I'm using the fact the control statements have a return value.  
That's not special to <code>case</code>s, and their value can be used or not, just as <code>if</code>s.

<h2>Iterators</h2>
# Here's a different way to add up an array.
fred = [ 4, 19, 3, 7, 32 ]
sum = 0
fred.each { |i| sum += i }
print "Sum of [", fred.join(" "), "] is #{sum}\n"

# Or create a secret message.
key = { 'A' =&gt; 'U', 'B' =&gt; 'Q', 'C' =&gt; 'A', 'D' =&gt; 'F', 'E' =&gt; 'D', 'F' =&gt; 'K',
       'G' =&gt; 'P', 'H' =&gt; 'W', 'I' =&gt; 'N', 'J' =&gt; 'L', 'K' =&gt; 'J', 'L' =&gt; 'M',
       'M' =&gt; 'S', 'N' =&gt; 'V', 'O' =&gt; 'Y', 'P' =&gt; 'O', 'Q' =&gt; 'Z', 'R' =&gt; 'T',
       'S' =&gt; 'E', 'T' =&gt; 'I', 'U' =&gt; 'X', 'V' =&gt; 'B', 'W' =&gt; 'G', 'X' =&gt; 'H',
       'Y' =&gt; 'R', 'Z' =&gt; 'C' }
print "\nThe encoded message is: "
"The secret message".each_byte do | b |
   b = b.chr.upcase
   if key.has_key?(b) then
       print key[b]
   else
       print b
   end end print "\n"

# But give us the info to read it anyway.
print "The key is: "
ct = 8
key.each { | k, v | 
   if ct == 8 then 
       print "\n   "
       ct = 0
   else
       print ", "
   end
   ct = ct + 1
   print "#{v} =&gt; #{k}"  
}
print "\n\n"

# Some interesting things from Integer.
3.times { print "Hi! " }
print "\n"

print "Count: "
3.upto(7) { |n| print n, " " }
print "\n"

Ruby iterators are methods which take and run a block of code.
The block can be delimited by curly braces or by the keywords 
<code>do</code> and <code>end</code>.  
The brackets have higher precedence, and variables declared in them are destroyed when the bracked code exits.

The parameter names for the block are listed between <code>|</code> symbols at the start of the block.  
This syntax is borrowed from Smalltalk.

Note: Ruby uses the term "iterator" rather differently than C++.

<h2>Methods I</h2>
# Square the number def sqr(x)
   return x*x end

# See how it works.
(rand(4) + 2).times {
   a = rand(300)
   print a,"^2 = ", sqr(a), "\n"
}
print "\n"

# Don't need a parm.
def boom
   print "Boom!\n"
end boom boom

# Default parms print "\n"
def line(cnt, ender = "+", fill = "-")
   print ender, fill * cnt, ender, "\n"
end line(8)
line(5,'*')
line(11,'+','=')

# Do they change?
def incr(n)
   n = n + 1
end a = 5
incr(a)
print a,"\n"

Functions (and later methods) are defined with <code>def</code>.
Parameters are given, without types of course.
Default values may be provided.

Note that when we send an integer, the method does not change the value sent.

<h2>Methods II</h2>
# Place the array in a random order.  
Floyd's alg.
def shuffle(arr)
   for n in 0...arr.size
       targ = n + rand(arr.size - n)
       arr[n], arr[targ] = arr[targ], arr[n] if n != targ
   end end

# Make strange declarations.
def pairs(a, b)
   a &lt;&lt; 'Insane'
   shuffle(b)
   b.each { |x| shuffle(a); a.each { |y| print y, " ", x, ".\n" } }
end first = ['Strange', 'Fresh', 'Alarming']
pairs(first, ['lemonade', 'procedure', 'sounds', 'throughway'])
print "\n", first.join(" "), "\n"

Here's another use of methods.
Notice that when we send an array as a parameter,
changes in the function <i>do</i> update the value to the caller.

One incidental thing we have not seen before is parallel assignment in the <code>shuffle</code> function which exchanges two values.

<h2>Methods III</h2>
# Add the strings before and after around each parm and print def surround(before, after, *items)
   items.each { |x| print before, x, after, "\n" }
end

surround('[', ']', 'this', 'that', 'the other')
print "\n"

surround('&lt;', '&gt;', 'Snakes', 'Turtles', 'Snails', 'Salamanders', 'Slugs',
       'Newts')
print "\n"

def boffo(a, b, c, d)
   print "a = #{a} b = #{b}, c = #{c}, d = #{d}\n"
end

# Use * to adapt between arrays and arguments a1 = ['snack', 'fast', 'junk', 'pizza']
a2 = [4, 9]
boffo(*a1)
boffo(17, 3, *a2)

The <code>*</code> is used to adapt between arrays and parameter or argument lists.
In a call, a <code>*</code> before an array treats the array members as separate arguments.  
A <code>*</code> before the last parameter causes it to receive all remaining arguments as an array.

<h2>Exceptions I</h2>
# Count and report the number of lines and characters in a file.
print "File name: "
fn = gets.chomp begin
   f = open(fn)
   nlines = 0
   length = 0
   f.each { |line| nlines += 1; length += line.length }
rescue
   print "File read failed: " + $! + "\n"
else
   print fn, ": ", nlines, " lines, ", length, " characters.\n"
end

Ruby uses exceptions.  
Instead of
<code>try</code>, the block is called <code>begin</code>, and instead of
<code>catch</code> there is <code>rescue</code>.  
The <code>else</code> is executed when no exception occurs.  
There is also an
<code>ensure</code> block which is always run last, exception or no.

<h2>Regular Expressions I</h2>
# Get a chomped string, or nil at EOF.
def getstr
   print "Please enter a test string: "
   str = gets
   return str unless str
   return str.chomp end

# Test strings while str = getstr
   print "You entered: ", str, "\n"
  # Run some random tests and print a descriptive message for ones which
   # match.
   num = 0
   if str =~ /^\s*$/ then
       print "  &gt; Your string is all blanks.\n"
       next
   end
   if str =~ /Mommy/ then
       print "  &gt; Contains Mommy\n"
       num += 1 
   end
   if str =~ /Mommy.*Daddy/ then
       print "  &gt; Contains Mommy, then Daddy\n"
       num += 1 
   end
   if str !~ /CAT/ then
       print "  &gt; Does not contain CAT.\n"
       num += 1 
   end
   if str !~ /[Cc][Aa][Tt]/ then
       print "  &gt; Does not contain cat (any capitalization).\n"
       num += 1 
   end
   if str =~ /^AA/ then
       print "  &gt; Starts with AA\n"
       num += 1 
   end
   if str =~ /(ing|ed)$/ then
       print "  &gt; Ends in ing or ed\n"
       num += 1 
   end
   if str =~ /^\d+$/ then

Regular expressions are patterns which can be matched against strings.
The usual syntax is to surround them with slashes, which create a
<code>Regexp</code> object, much as putting quoted characters create a
<code>String</code> object.  
As the <code>%Q</code> for strings, the
<code>%r</code> notation allows an alternate delimiter on regular expressions.

In this program, use the <code>=~</code> operator to ask if a string matches the pattern, and <code>!~</code> to ask if it doesn't.

Parentheses used in regular expressions group operations just as the do in ordinary expressions.  
In addition,
the characters matched by each parenthetical group are assigned to a special variable, <code>$</code><i>n</i>, where the left paren was the <i>n</i>th from the left.

Regular expressions are a large topic, and we'll have some class discussion about them.

<h2>Regular Expressions II</h2>
# Using re's to break up a line.
print "Please enter a line: "
line = gets.chomp

res = [ ]
while res != ''
   # String leading blanks.
   line.sub!(/^\s*/, '')
  break if line == ''
  # See what the leading is for next action.
   if line[0].chr == '"' then
       # Quoted.
       line.sub!(/^"([^"]*)"/, '')
       res.push($1)
   elsif line.sub!(/^(\d+):(\S+)/, '')
       # Repeated with n:
       $1.to_i.times { res.push($2) }
   else
       # Just a word.
       line.sub!(/^(\S+)/, '')
       res.push($1)
   end

end

res.each { |x| print "  [", x, "]\n" }

The <code>sub</code> and <code>sub!</code> methods of <code>String</code> match their first argument (a regular expression), and replace the portion matched with their second (a string).

This program breaks up the input line into words, with two special notations.  
Double-quoted sections are obeyed, which can contain spaces, and a word can be repeated by placing a count and a colon before it, like <code>5:fred</code> instead of typing <code>fred</code> five times.



<h2>More List Ops</h2>

fred = [ 4, 9, 18, 3, 87, 9, 12 ]
alex = [ 'Susan', 'Joe', 'Alex', 'Alice', 'Sam' ]

# Compute a new array with each member of fred doubled.
fred = fred.map { |x| 2 * x }
print fred.join(" "), "\n"

# Create a new alex adding " went away" to each member.  
Then join and
# print the result.
print (alex.map { |z| z + " went away" }).join("  "), "\n"

# Print the members of fred which are more than five and less than 20.
print (fred.select { |z| z &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; z &lt; 20 }).join(" "), "\n"

# Print the lengths of the members of alex that start with A or end with e.
print ((alex.select { |n| n =~ /^A/ || n =~ /e$/ }).map { |z| z.length }).
       join(" "), "\n"

# Update alex by surround each of its members with [ ]
alex.map! { |a| "[" + a + "]" }
print alex.join(" "), "\n"

The built-in <code>Array</code> class contains a number of iterators which work on the entire list and return a list result.
Two important ones are <code>map</code>, which runs the code block on each member of the list, and returns the list of results from those operations.  
The other is <code>select</code>, which also runs a code block on each member of the list.  
This block should return a boolean,
and a new list is build of only those members for which the code block produces true.  
The code block can be thought of as a filter which decides, for each member, if it should be retained.

The plain forms, <code>map</code> and <code>select</code> return a new array.
The emphatic forms, <code>map!</code> and <code>select!</code> update the list.

This program reads and evaluates polynomials.  
The arithmetic uses integers, though it could be adapted easily enough to used floats outside the exponent values.

Polynomials are read in as a list of coefficients.  
The number of values determines the order.  
The main program is a double loop,
the outer reading polynomials, and the inner reading <i>x</i> values.
The user can enter any number of polynomials, and, for each, evaluate them at any number of domain values.  
Either loop is ended by entering a blank line.  
An EOF will halt the program directly.

A couple of novelties and notables:

The <code>polyval</code> function takes an <i>x</i> value and a list of coefficients representing the polynomial and evaluates it at <i>x</i>.
The evaluation loop is destructive, so the function begins by cloning the array so the original is un-damaged.  
The clone method, as you might imagine, makes a copy of the object.
The built-in <code>readline</code> function is the same as <code>gets</code>,
except it raises the end-of-file exception.  
Ruby gives you a choice to use exceptions or not.
This program makes some use of the list operations.  
In particular,
the <code>polystr</code> method which converts the polynomial to a 
string for printing uses <code>map</code> and <code>select</code>.  
The <code>map</code>
converts the list of coefficients to a list of pairs, coefficient and exponent, then <code>select</code> eliminates the zero terms.
When the user enters a bad polynomial, the program raises a
<code>TypeError</code>.  
The reading loop catches this with a <code>rescue</code>, then issues a <code>retry</code> to allow the user to reenter the polynomial.
The <code>retry</code> used in a <code>rescue</code> block simply starts the <code>begin</code>
block over from the beginning.

It has an interface similar enough
# to Gate to be used in place of one, though it isn't derived from Gate.
# Ruby thinks this is just fine.

# To build compound circuits, you must create a Blueprint.  
To do so:
#   1. Create the Blueprint object.
#   2. Create the objects, and connect them to each other.  
Don't make
#      any external connections.
#   3. As needed specify gates you create as input or output devices for
#      the compund.
#   4. Call lock().  
This completes the Bluprint and makes it ready to
#      generate compounds.
# The resulting Blueprint is also a Compound.  
It can be connected and used
# like a Gate (though it is not derived from Gate).  
The another method
# of Blueprint creates a Compound, which can be used in a circuit, but
# lacks the building infrastructure.

The <code>Tree</code> class also includes the common operations.  

This one also implements an <code>each</code> iterator.  
This one uses the parameter <code>&amp;blk</code>.  
The <code>&amp;</code> converts the code block to a Closure object.  
Closures are executable code.  
It is bound to the parameter <code>blk</code> which is sent to <code>Node#each</code>.  
There it becomes a parameter <code>block</code>, and is run with the <code>call</code>
method.
