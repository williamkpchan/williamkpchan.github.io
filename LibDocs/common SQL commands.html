<h3>ALTER TABLE</h3>
ALTER TABLE table_name 
ADD column_name datatype;
<code>ALTER TABLE</code> lets you add columns to a table in a database.

<h3>AND</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_1 = value_1
  AND column_2 = value_2;
<code>AND</code> is an operator that combines two conditions. Both conditions must be true for the row to be included in the result set.

<h3>AS</h3>
SELECT column_name AS &#x27;Alias&#x27;
FROM table_name;
<code>AS</code> is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an <em>alias</em>.

<h3>AVG()</h3>
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name;
<code>AVG()</code> is an aggregate function that returns the average value for a numeric column.

<h3>BETWEEN</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2;

The <code>BETWEEN</code> operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. The values can be numbers, text or dates.

<h3>CASE</h3>
SELECT column_name,
  CASE
    WHEN condition THEN &#x27;Result_1&#x27;
    WHEN condition THEN &#x27;Result_2&#x27;
    ELSE &#x27;Result_3&#x27;
  END
FROM table_name;
<code>CASE</code> statements are used to create different outputs (usually in the <code>SELECT</code> statement). It is SQL’s way of handling if-then logic.

<h3>COUNT()</h3>
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name;
<code>COUNT()</code> is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of rows where the column is not <code>NULL</code>.

<h3>CREATE TABLE</h3>
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column_1 datatype, 
  column_2 datatype, 
  column_3 datatype
);
<code>CREATE TABLE</code> creates a new table in the database. It allows you to specify the name of the table and the name of each column in the table.

<h3>DELETE</h3>
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column = some_value;
<code>DELETE</code> statements are used to remove rows from a table.

<h3>GROUP BY</h3>
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
<code>GROUP BY</code> is a clause in SQL that is only used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the <code>SELECT</code> statement to arrange identical data into groups.

<h3>HAVING</h3>
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; value;
<code>HAVING</code> was added to SQL because the <code>WHERE</code> keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

<h3>INNER JOIN</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_1
JOIN table_2
  ON table_1.column_name = table_2.column_name;

An inner join will combine rows from different tables if the <em>join condition</em> is true.

<h3>INSERT</h3>
INSERT INTO table_name (column_1, column_2, column_3) 
VALUES (value_1, &#x27;value_2&#x27;, value_3);
<code>INSERT</code> statements are used to add a new row to a table.

<h3>IS NULL / IS NOT NULL</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
<code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS NOT NULL</code> are operators used with the <code>WHERE</code> clause to test for empty values.

<h3>LIKE</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
<code>LIKE</code> is a special operator used with the <code>WHERE</code> clause to search for a specific pattern in a column.

<h3>LIMIT</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
<code>LIMIT</code> is a clause that lets you specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have.

<h3>MAX()</h3>
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;
<code>MAX()</code> is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column.

<h3>MIN()</h3>
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name;
<code>MIN()</code> is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the smallest value in that column.

<h3>OR</h3>
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = value_1
   OR column_name = value_2;
<code>OR</code> is an operator that filters the result set to only include rows where either condition is true.

<h3>ORDER BY</h3>
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC | DESC;
<code>ORDER BY</code> is a clause that indicates you want to sort the result set by a particular column either alphabetically or numerically.

<h3>OUTER JOIN</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_1
LEFT JOIN table_2
  ON table_1.column_name = table_2.column_name;

An outer join will combine rows from different tables even if the join condition is not met. Every row in the <em>left</em> table is returned in the result set, and if the join condition is not met, then <code>NULL</code> values are used to fill in the columns from the <em>right</em> table.

<h3>ROUND()</h3>
SELECT ROUND(column_name, integer)
FROM table_name;
<code>ROUND()</code> is a function that takes a column name and an integer as arguments. It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

<h3>SELECT</h3>
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name;
<code>SELECT</code> statements are used to fetch data from a database. Every query will begin with <code>SELECT</code>.

<h3>SELECT DISTINCT</h3>
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;
<code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> specifies that the statement is going to be a query that returns unique values in the specified column(s).

<h3>SUM</h3>
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name;
<code>SUM()</code> is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

<h3>UPDATE</h3>
UPDATE table_name
SET some_column = some_value
WHERE some_column = some_value;
<code>UPDATE</code> statements allow you to edit rows in a table.

<h3>WHERE</h3>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
<code>WHERE</code> is a clause that indicates you want to filter the result set to include only rows where the following <em>condition</em> is true.

<h3>WITH</h3>
WITH temporary_name AS (
   SELECT *
   FROM table_name)
SELECT *
FROM temporary_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
<code>WITH</code> clause lets you store the result of a query in a temporary table using an alias. You can also define multiple temporary tables using a comma and with one instance of the <code>WITH</code> keyword.
<p>The <code>WITH</code> clause is also known as common table expression (CTE) and subquery factoring.

<h3>Executing SQL Statements from a Text File</h3>
mysql> source C:\Users\User\Desktop\init2.sql

To put SQL statements in a file and then tell mysql to read its input from that file. 
To do so, create a text file text_file that contains the statements you wish to execute. 

Then invoke mysql as shown here:

shell> mysql db_name < text_file

If you place a USE db_name statement as the first statement in the file, it is unnecessary to specify the database name on the command line:

shell> mysql < text_file

If you are already running mysql, you can execute an SQL script file using the source command or \. command:

mysql> source file_name
mysql> \. file_name

Sometimes you may want your script to display progress information to the user. 

For this you can insert statements like this:

SELECT '<info_to_display>' AS ' ';

The statement shown outputs <info_to_display>.

You can also invoke mysql with the --verbose option, which causes each statement to be displayed before the result that it produces.

mysql ignores Unicode byte order mark (BOM) characters at the beginning of input files. 

Previously, it read them and sent them to the server, resulting in a syntax error. 

Presence of a BOM does not cause mysql to change its default character set. 
To do that, invoke mysql with an option such as --default-character-set=utf8.

For more information about batch mode, see Section 3.5, “Using mysql in Batch Mode”.

init.sql
CREATE DATABASE test;
  use test;
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    lastname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT(3),
    location VARCHAR(50),
    date TIMESTAMP
  );

<h3>Listing all databases inside mysql</h3>
mysql> show databases;

Listing tables and their structure with the MySQL Command Line

select a database
list all the tables in the selected database with the following command:
mysql> show tables;

We can show the structure of the table using the "desc" command:
mysql> desc tableName;

show the indexes from a particular table:
mysql> show keys from tableName;

<h3>rename and duplicate table</h3>
RENAME TABLE tb1 TO tb2;

CREATE TABLE newtable LIKE oldtable; 
INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable;
