<h2><span class="orange">How to Use COUNTIFS with a Date Range in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to count the number of cell values that fall in a date range in Excel:
<b>=COUNTIFS(A2:A11,">="&D2, A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)
</b>
This formula counts the number of cells in the range <b>A2:A11</b> where the date is between the dates in cells <b>D2</b> and <b>E2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Use COUNTIFS with Date Range in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of sales made by some company on various days:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rangeexcel1.jpg"445">
We can define a start and end date in cells D2 and E2 respectively, then use the following formula to count how many dates fall within the start and end date:
<b>=COUNTIFS(A2:A11,">="&D2, A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rangeexcel2.jpg">
We can see that <b>3</b> days fall between 1/10/2022 and 1/15/2022.
We can manually verify that the following three dates in column A fall in this range:
1/12/2022
1/14/2022
1/15/2022
If we change either the start or end date, the formula will automatically update to count the cells within the new date range.
For example, suppose we change the start date to 1/1/2022:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rangeexcel3.jpg"564">
We can see that <b>8</b> days fall between 1/1/2022 and 1/15/2022.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Create a List Based on Criteria</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to create a list based on criteria in Excel:
<b>=IFERROR(INDEX($A$2:$A$12,SMALL(IF($B$2:$B$12=$B$2,ROW($B$2:$B$12)),ROW(1:1))-1,1),"")
</b>
This particular formula creates a list of values in the range <b>A2:A12</b> where the value in the range <b>B2:B12</b> is equal to the value in cell <b>B2</b>.
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice with the following dataset in Excel:

<b>=IFERROR(INDEX($A$2:$A$12,SMALL(IF($B$2:$B$12=$B$2,ROW($B$2:$B$12)),ROW(1:1))-1,1),"")</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>E2</b> and then drag it down to the remaining cells in column E to create a list of players who are on the Mavs team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/criteria2.jpg">
The result is a list of three players:
Andy
Bob
Frank
We can look at the original dataset to confirm that all three of these players are on the Mavs team.
<h2>Example 2: Create List Based on Multiple Criteria in Excel</h2>
We can use the following formula to create a list of players who are on the <b>Mavs</b> team and have a position of <b>Guard</b>:
<b>=IFERROR(INDEX($A$2:$A$12,SMALL(IF(($B$2:$B$12=$B$2)*($C$2:$C$12=$C$2),ROW($B$2:$B$12)),ROW(1:1))-1,1),"")</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>E2</b> and then drag it down to the remaining cells in column E to create a list of players who are on the Mavs team and have a position of Guard:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/criteria3.jpg">

<h2><span class="orange">Calculate Cumulative Percentage in Excel (With Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to calculate a cumulative percentage of some dataset. Fortunately this is easy to do using built-in functions in Excel.
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate cumulative percentages in Excel.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s create a dataset that shows the number of units that some company sells during consecutive years:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cumPercent1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Calculate Cumulative Frequency</h3>
Next, let’s use the following formula to calculate the cumulative frequency of the first row:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cumPercent2.png">
We can then copy and paste this formula to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cumPercent3.png">
<h3>Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Percentage</h3>
Next, we can use the following formula to calculate the cumulative percentage of the first row:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cumPercent4.png">
We can then copy and paste this formula to the remaining cells in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cumPercent5.png">
<h3>Step 4: Change Formatting to Percentage</h3>
Lastly, we can highlight each of the cumulative percentage values in column D and then press <b>Ctrl+Shift+%</b> to convert the formatting to percentages:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cumPercent6-1.png">
We interpret the cumulative percentages as follows:
About <b>6%</b> of all sales were made in year 1.
About <b>13%</b> of all sales were made in years 1 and 2 combined.
About<b> 20%</b> of all sales were made in years 1, 2, and 3 combined.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate a Cumulative Sum by Date in Excel</span></h2>
This tutorial explains how to calculate a cumulative sum grouped by date in Excel.
<h3>Step 1: Create the Data</h3>
First, let’s create a dataset that shows the total sales of some store by date:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cumsales1.jpg"494">
<h3>Step 2: Calculate Overall Cumulative Sum</h3>
Next, we can create a column that displays the overall cumulative sum of sales.
First, type <b>=B2</b> in cell C2.
Then, type the following formula in cell C3: 
<b>=SUM($B$2:B3)
</b>
Then drag this formula down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cumsales2.jpg"586">
<h3>Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Sum by Date</h3>
Next, we can create a column that displays the cumulative sum of sales by date.
First, type <b>=B2</b> in cell D2.
Then, type the following formula in cell D3: 
<b>=IF(A3=A2, B3+D2, B3)
</b>
Then drag this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cumsales3.jpg"595">
The result is a column that displays the cumulative sales grouped by each date.
For example:
The cumulative sales for <b>1/1/2022</b> is: 5, 8, 15, 27
The cumulative sales for <b>1/2/2022</b> is: 7, 12, 2
The cumulative sales for <b>1/3/2022</b> is: 15
The cumulative sales for <b>1/4/2022</b> is: 3, 10, 19, 29
Notice that the values in the cumulative sum column restart for each new date.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Daily Compound Interest in Excel</span></h2>
We can use the following formula to find the ending value of some investment after a certain amount of time:
<b>A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup></b>
where:
<b>A:</b> Final Amount
<b>P:</b> Initial Principal
<b>r:</b> Annual Interest Rate
<b>n:</b> Number of compounding periods per year
<b>t:</b> Number of years
If the investment is compounded <b>daily</b>, then we can use 365 for <em>n</em>:
<b>A = P(1 + r/365)<sup>365t</sup></b>
The following example shows how to use this formula in Excel to calculate the ending value of some investment that has been compounded daily.
<h3>Example: Daily Compound Interest Formula in Excel</h3>
Suppose we invest $5,000 into an investment that compounds at a rate of 6% annually. Assume the investment compounds on a daily basis.
The following screenshot shows how to use the compound interest formula in Excel to calculate the ending value of this investment after 10 years:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dailycompound1.jpg"499">
This investment will be worth <b>$9,110.14</b> after 10 years.
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the ending investment after each year during the 10-year period.
<b>Note</b>: Column F shows the formula we used in each corresponding cell in Column E:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dailycompound2.jpg"677">
From the output we can see:
At the end of year 1, the investment is worth <b>$5,309.16</b>.
At the end of year 2, the investment is worth <b>$5,637.43</b>.
At the end of year 3, the investment is worth <b>$5,986.00</b>.
And by the end of year 10, the investment is worth <b>$9,110.14</b>.
To visualize the investment growth over time, simply highlight the cells in the range<b> E2:E11</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click the <b>2-D Column Chart</b> option with the <b>Charts</b> group:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dailycompound3.jpg"615">
The x-axis shows the year and the height of the bars represent the investment value at the end of each year.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Delete Filtered Rows in Excel (With Example)</span></h2>

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: Calculate Difference Between Two Times in Hours</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate the difference between two times in hours in Excel:
<b>=(B2-A2)*24
</b>
This particular formula calculates the difference (in hours) between the times in cells <b>B2</b> and <b>A2</b>.
By default, the formula <b>B2-A2</b> would return the difference between cells <b>B2</b> and <b>A2</b> in terms of days.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we must multiply the result of <b>B2-A2</b> by 24 to get the difference in terms of hours instead of days.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Calculate Difference Between Times in Hours in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following two columns in Excel that show the start and end times for some events:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/minutes1-1.jpg"481">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b> to calculate the difference between the start and end time for the first row in terms of hours:
<b>=(B2-A2)*24</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/hours1.jpg"472">
The values in column C display the difference in hours between the <b>Start Time</b> and <b>End Time</b> for each row.
Note that the time difference in the last row is greater than 24 because the difference between the <b>Start Time</b> and <b>End Time</b> for the last row is greater than one whole day.
<b>Note</b>: If you only want to know the difference between two times in terms of <em>whole hours</em>, you can use the following formula:
<b>=INT((B2-A2)*24)</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: Calculate Difference Between Two Times in Minutes</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate the difference between two times in minutes in Excel:
<b>=(B2-A2)*1440
</b>
This particular formula calculates the difference (in minutes) between the times in cells <b>B2</b> and <b>A2</b>.
By default, the formula <b>B2-A2</b> would return the difference between cells <b>B2</b> and <b>A2</b> in terms of days.
Since there are 1,440 minutes in a day, we must multiply the result of <b>B2-A2</b> by 1,440 to get the difference in terms of minutes instead of days.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Calculate Difference Between Times in Minutes in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following two columns in Excel that show the start and end times for some events:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/minutes1-1.jpg"481">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate an Exponential Moving Average in Excel</span></h2>
In time series analysis, a <b>moving average </b>is simply the average value of a certain number of previous periods.
An <b>exponential moving average </b>is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent observations, which means it’s able to capture recent trends more quickly.
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate an exponential moving average in Excel
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the following dataset that shows the total sales made by a company during 10 consecutive sales periods:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ema1.jpg"451">
<h3>Step 2: Calculate the Exponential Moving Average</h3>
Next, we’ll calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) using the following formula:
<b>EMV = [Latest Value  - Previous EMA] * (2/n+1) + Previous EMA
</b>
In the formula, <b>n</b> represents the number of periods to use to calculate the exponential moving average. This is the one number that you must specify.
For our example, we’ll calculate a 3-day EMA.
First, we’ll enter the EMA value in cell <b>B2</b> to be equal to the value in cell <b>A2</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ema2.jpg"445">
Next, we’ll use the following formula to calculate the first value for the 3-day EMA:
<b>=(A3-B2)*(2/($E$1+1))+B2
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ema3.jpg">
Next, hover over the bottom right corner of cell <b>B3</b> until a tiny “<b>+</b>” cross appears. Double click the cross to copy and paste the formula down to the remaining cells in the column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ema4.jpg"465">
Column <b>B</b> now shows the 3-day exponential moving average of sales.
To calculate an exponential moving average using a different number of periods, simply change the value in cell <b>E1</b>.
For example, we could calculate the 4-day exponential moving average of sales instead by simply changing the value in cell <b>E1</b> to 4:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ema5-1.jpg"474">
Column <b>B</b> now shows the 4-day exponential moving average of sales.

Notice that the filtered dataset only contains the rows where the Team names from original dataset in the range <b>A2:C11</b> are in the list of names in the range <b>E2:E5</b>.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>FILTER</b> function is case-insensitive. This means if you type “nets” instead of “Nets”, the function will still return the row with the “Nets” in the Team column.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_filter_year5.jpg"408">
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Filter Cells that Contain Multiple Words</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to filter cells in Excel that contain multiple words:
<b>=FILTER(A2:B8,ISNUMBER(SEARCH("word1", A2:A8))*ISNUMBER(SEARCH("word2", A2:A8)))
</b>
This formula will return the rows in the range<b> A2:B8</b> where the cells in the range<b> A2:A8</b> contain both “word1” and “word2.”
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Filter Cells that Contain Multiple Words</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that contains the title and years of experience for staff members of a sports team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultipletext1.jpg"517">
We can use the following formula to filter for the rows where the title contains the word “Assistant” and “Coach” in the same cell:
<b>=FILTER(A2:B8,ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Assistant", A2:A8))*ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Coach", A2:A8)))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultipletext2.jpg">
We can see that the filter only returns the three rows that contain the word “Assistant” and “Coach” in the same cell.
It’s important to note that we can also use substrings when filtering.
For example, we could use the following formula to filter for the rows where the title contains the word “Assist” and “Coach” in the same cell:
<b>=FILTER(A2:B8,ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Assist", A2:A8))*ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Coach", A2:A8)))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultipletext3.jpg"599">
We can see that three cells are returned that contain the substring “Assist” and the full string “Coach” in the same cell.
<b>Note</b>: In each of these examples we filtered for cells that contained two specific words, but by using multiple asterisks (<b>*</b>) we can filter for cells that contain as many specific words as we’d like.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Filter Multiple Columns in Excel (With Example)</span></h2>
The easiest way to filter multiple columns in Excel is to use the <b>Advanced Filter</b> function.
The following examples show how to use this function in two different scenarios:
Filter for rows that meet multiple conditions
Filter for rows that meet one of multiple conditions
<h3>Example 1: Filter for Rows that Meet Multiple Conditions</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the total sales of certain products in certain regions for a company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/filtermultiple1.jpg"479">
Now suppose we’d like to filter for rows where the Region is <b>East</b> <em>and</em> the Product is <b>A</b>.
To do so, we can define the following range of cells that contains our criteria:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/filtermultiple2.jpg"559">
Next, we can click the <b>Data</b> tab and then click the <b>Advanced Filter</b> button:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/filtermultiple3.jpg"650">
We’ll choose <b>A1:C17</b> as the <b>list range</b> and <b>F1:G2</b> as the <b>criteria range</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/filtermultiple4.jpg"564">
Once we click <b>OK</b>, the dataset will be filtered to only show rows where the Region is <b>East</b> <em>and</em> the Product is <b>A</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/filtermultiple5.jpg"556">
<h3>Example 2: Filter for Rows that Meet One of Multiple Conditions</h3>

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Filter a Column by Multiple Values</span></h2>
Often you may want to filter a column by multiple values in Excel.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>Advanced Filter </b>function.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Filter Column by Multiple Values in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultiple11.jpg"480">
Now suppose we’d like to filter the dataset to only show rows where the Team column contains Heat or Celtics.
To do so, we can create a column that specifies which teams we’d like to filter for:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultiple12.jpg"534">
Then, click the <b>Data</b> tab along the top ribbon and then click the <b>Advanced</b> button within the <b>Sort & Filter</b> group:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultiple13.jpg"666">
In the new window that appears, use <b>A1:C16</b> as the List range and <b>E1:E3</b> as the Criteria range:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultiple14.jpg"546">
Once you click <b>OK</b>, the data will automatically be filtered to only show rows where the team name is equal to Heat or Celtics:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filtermultiple15.jpg"459">
In this particular example, we chose to filter the data in-place.
If you’d like the filtered data to appear in a different location, simply check the button next to <b>Copy to another location</b> within the Advanced Filter window.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use Wildcard in FILTER Function</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to use wildcard characters within a FILTER function in Excel:
<b>=FILTER(A2:B12, ISNUMBER(SEARCH("some_string", A2:A12)), "None")
</b>
This particular formula will filter the rows in the range<b> A2:B12 </b>where the cells in the range<b> A2:A12</b> contain “some_string” anywhere in the cell.
If no cell contains “some_string” then the formula will simply return the output “None.”
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use Wildcard in FILTER Function in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wildcard1.jpg"453">
We can use the following formula to filter for the rows where the Team column contains “ets” anywhere in the cell:
<b>=FILTER(A2:B12, ISNUMBER(SEARCH("ets", A2:A12)), "None")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wildcard2-1.jpg">
We can see that the filter only returns the four rows that contain “ets” somewhere in the Team name:
N<b>ets</b>
Nugg<b>ets</b>
Horn<b>ets</b>
Rock<b>ets</b>
Note that if we filter using some string that doesn’t exist in any Team name, the formula will simply return the output “None.”
For example, suppose we attempt to filter for rows where the Team name contains “zzz” somewhere in the cell:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wildcard3.jpg"667">
The formula returns “None” because no Team name has “zzz” anywhere in the Team name.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>SEARCH</b> function in the formula performs a case-insensitive search. If you’d like to perform a case-sensitive search, replace <b>SEARCH</b> with <b>FIND</b> in the formula.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Find the Top 10% of Values in an Excel Column</span></h2>
Occasional you may want to find the top 10% of values in an Excel column. Fortunately there are two quick ways to do this:
<b>1. Use Conditional Formatting > Top/Bottom Rules > Top 10%</b>
<b>2. Filter using =CELL >=PERCENTILE(CELL RANGE, 0.9)</b>
This tutorial provides an example of how to use each of these methods.
<h3>Example 1: Find Top 10% of Values Using Conditional Formatting</h3>
Suppose we have the following Excel column that contains 20 different values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_1.png">
One way to find the top 10% of values in this column is to highlight all of the values in the column and then click <b>Conditional Formatting > Top/Bottom Rules > Top 10%</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_2.png">
In the window that pops up, you’ll be given the option to highlight the top 10% of values using a certain color. We’ll leave it as the default option of light red with dark red text and click OK:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_3.png">
We can see that the values in the top 10% in this column are <b>123</b> and <b>143</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_4.png">
<h3>Example 2: Find Top 10% of Values Using a Formula</h3>
Another way to find the top 10% of values in a column is to create a new column of TRUE and FALSE values that indicate whether or not a given cell has a value at the 90th percentile or higher:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_5.png">
We can then click the <b>Data</b> tab along the top ribbon and click the <b>Filter</b> icon. We can then filter the <b>Top 10%</b> column to only show values that are TRUE:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_6.png">
We can see that the values in the top 10% of all values are <b>123</b> and <b>143</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_7.png">

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Find the Top 10 Values in a List</span></h2>
Occasionally you may want to find the top 10 values in a list in Excel. Fortunately this is easy to do using the  LARGE()  function, which uses the following syntax:
<b>LARGE(array, k)</b>
where:
<b>array:</b> The array of values.
<b>k:</b> The k<sup>th</sup> largest value to find in the array.
This tutorial shows an example of how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Find the Top 10 Values in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following column of 20 values in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10_1.png">
To find the 10 largest values in the list, we can create a new column titled <b>K</b> that lists numbers 1 through 10.
We can then create a column adjacent tot it titled <b>Value</b> and use the following formula to calculate the kth largest value in the dataset:
<b>=LARGE($A$2:$A$21,C3)
</b>
We can simply copy and paste this formula down to the remaining cells in the column to find the 10 largest values in the dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/klarge1.png">
This leaves us with a list of the 10 largest values in the dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/klarge2.png">
We can see that the largest value is <b>143</b>, the second largest is <b>123</b>, the third largest is <b>87</b>, and so on.
Note that we can use this method on a column of any length in Excel.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Find Unique Values from Multiple Columns</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to find unique values from multiple columns in Excel:
<b>=INDIRECT(TEXT(MIN(IF(($A$2:$C$11&lt;>"")*(COUNTIF($E$1:E1,$A$2:$C$11)=0),ROW($2:$11)*100+COLUMN($A:$C),7^8)),"R0C00"),)&""
</b>
This particular formula finds the unique values in the cell range <b>A2:C11</b> and returns a list of the unique values in column <b>E</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Find Unique Values from Multiple Columns in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following three lists of basketball team names in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/uniquemultiple1.jpg"475">
To find the unique values from each of the three columns, we can use the following formula:
<b>=INDIRECT(TEXT(MIN(IF(($A$2:$C$11&lt;>"")*(COUNTIF($E$1:E1,$A$2:$C$11)=0),ROW($2:$11)*100+COLUMN($A:$C),7^8)),"R0C00"),)&""
</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>E2</b> and press <b>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/uniquemultiple2.jpg"500">
We can then click and drag this formula down to other cells in column E until blank values start appearing:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/uniquemultiple3.jpg">
From the output we can see that there are 11 unique team names across the three columns of team names.
<b>Note</b>: To use this formula with more columns, simply modify the <b>A2:C11</b> cell range in the formula to include more columns.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Find Y-Intercept of a Graph in Excel</span></h2>
The <b>y-intercept</b> of a graph represents the point where a line crosses the y-axis when x is equal to zero.
To find the y-intercept of a line in Excel, we can use the <b>INTERCEPT</b> function.
This functions uses the following syntax:
<b>INTERCEPT(known_y’s, known_x’s)</b>
where:
<b>known_y’s</b>: The range of y-values
<b>known_x’s</b>: The range of x-values
The following example shows how to use this function in practice to calculate the y-intercept of a graph in Excel.
<h2>Step 1: Create the Data</h2>
First, let’s create a dataset with two variables in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/corrgraph1.jpg"441">
<h2>Step 2: Calculate Y-Intercept Value</h2>
Next, let’s type the following formula into cell <b>E1</b> to calculate the y-intercept for this dataset:
<b>=INTERCEPT(B2:B21, A2:A21)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/yint1.jpg"483">
From the output we can see that the y-intercept is <b>12.46176</b>.
<h2>Step 3: Visualize the Y-Intercept Value</h2>
To visualize the y-intercept value, we can create a scatterplot and add a trendline.
To do so, highlight the values in the range <b>A2:B21</b>, then click the <b>Insert </b>tab, then click <b>Insert Scatter (X, Y) </b>in the <b>Charts</b> group and click the first option to create a scatterplot:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/regLine2.png">
The following scatterplot will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/corrgraph2.jpg"659">
Next, click the green plus sign in the top right corner of the plot, then click the arrow next to <b>Trendline</b> and click <b>More Options</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/yint2.jpg"680">
In the <b>Format Trendline</b> panel that appears on the right side of the screen, click the <b>Linear</b> trendline option, then check the box next to <b>Display Equation on chart</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/yint3.jpg"322">
The linear trendline and the equation for the linear trendline will be displayed on the chart:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/yint4.jpg"572">
From the output we can see the formula for the linear trendline:
<b>y = 0.917x + 12.462</b>
This means that when x is equal to zero, the estimated value of y (i.e. the y-intercept) is <b>12.462</b>.
If we imagine that the linear trendline extends all the way to the left until it reaches the y-axis, it does indeed look like the line would cross the y-axis at a value of y = <b>12.462</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Get First Day of Month in Excel (With Examples)</span></h2>
You can use one of the following formulas to get the first day of the month for a date in Excel:
<b>Formula 1: Use DAY() Function</b>
<b>=A2-DAY(A2)+1
</b>
<b>Formula 2: Use EOMONTH() Function</b>
<b>=EOMONTH(A2,-1)+1
</b>
Both formulas will return the first day of the month for the date in cell <b>A2</b>.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/firstday1.jpg"501">
<h2>Example 1: Get First Day of Month Using DAY()</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b> to get the first day of the month for the date in cell <b>A2</b>:
<b>=A2-DAY(A2)+1</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/firstday2.jpg">
Column C now displays the first day of the month for each date in column A.
Here’s how this formula works:
The <b>DAY()</b> function returns the day of the month between 1 and 31.
Thus, <b>A2 – DAY(A2)</b> returns the last day of the previous month.
Then, we add one to get the first day of the month for the date in cell <b>A2</b>.
<h2>
<b>Example 2:Get First Day of Month Using EOMONTH()</b>
</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b> to get the first day of the month for the date in cell <b>A2</b>:
<b>=EOMONTH(A2,-1)+1</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/firstday3.jpg">
Column C now displays the first day of the month for each date in column A.
Here’s how this formula works:
The <b>EOMONTH()</b> function returns the last day of the month for a date.
The function<b> EOMONTH(A2, -1)</b> returns the last day of the previous month.
Then, we add one to get the first day of the month for the date in cell <b>A2</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Group Data by Week in Excel</span></h2>
Often you may want to group data by week in Excel.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>WEEKNUM()</b> function.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this function to group data by week in Excel.
<h2>Step 1: Create the Data</h2>
First, let’s create a dataset that shows the total sales made by some company on various days:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/weeknum1.jpg"488">
<h2>Step 2: Create Week Variable</h2>
To extract the week of the year from the Date column, we can use the <b>WEEKNUM()</b> function to return a value between 1 and 53.
We can type in the following formula in cell C2:
<b>=WEEKNUM(A2) </b>
We can then copy and paste this formula down to the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/weeknum2.jpg"479">
<h2>Step 3: Create a Pivot Table</h2>
Lastly, we can create a pivot table to find the sum of sales made each week.
To create a pivot table, highlight the cells in the range <b>B1:C11</b> and then click the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon and click <b>PivotTable</b>.
In the new window that appears, we’ll place the pivot table in cell <b>E2</b> of the existing worksheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/weeknum3.jpg"673">
Once we press <b>OK</b>, a PivotTable Fields panel will appear on the right side of the screen.
Drag the <b>Week </b>variable to the Rows box and the <b>Sales </b>variable to the Values box:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/weeknum4.jpg"366">
The values in the pivot table will now be filled in.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/weeknum5.jpg"583">
From the pivot table we can see:
The total sales made during week 2 were <b>37</b>.
The total sales made during week 3 were <b>65</b>.
The total sales made during week 4 were <b>62</b>.
We can also see that the grand total of sales made was <b>164</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use IF and VLOOKUP Nested Function</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to use an IF and VLOOKUP nested function in Excel:
<b>=IF(VLOOKUP(D2,$A$1:$B$11,2,FALSE)>100,"Yes","No")
</b>
This particular formula looks up the value in cell <b>D2</b> in the range <b>A1:A11</b> and finds the corresponding value in <b>B1:B11</b>.
If this value is greater than 100, “Yes” is returned.
Otherwise, “No” is returned.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: How to Use IF and VLOOKUP Nested Function</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the points scored by various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/if_vlookup1.jpg"495">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>E2 </b>to determine whether or not the Mavs scored more than 100 points:
<b>=IF(VLOOKUP(D2,$A$1:$B$11,2,FALSE)>100,"Yes","No")</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, the results will be shown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/if_vlookup2.jpg"636">
From the results we can see that the Mavs did score more than 100 points.
Note that if we change the team name in cell <b>D2</b>, the results will automatically update.
For example, suppose we change the team name to Suns:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/if_vlookup3.jpg"637">
From the results we can see that the Suns did not score more than 100 points.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Check if Cell Contains Partial Text</span></h2>
You can use the following formula in Excel to determine if a cell contains specific partial text:
<b>=IF(COUNTIF(A1,"*abc*"),"Yes","No")
</b>
In this example, if cell <b>A1</b> contains the string “<b>abc</b>” in any part of the cell then it will return a <b>Yes</b>, otherwise it will return a <b>No</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Check if Cell Contains Partial Text in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/partial11.jpg"441">
We can use the following formula to check if the value in the Team column contains the partial text “guar”:
<b>=IF(COUNTIF(A2,"*guar*"),"Yes","No")</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>C2</b> and then copy and paste it down to the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/partial12.jpg">
Any rows with the partial text “guar” in the Team column all receive a <b>Yes</b> in the new column while all other rows receive a <b>No</b>.
Also note that we could return values other than “Yes” and “No.”
For example, we could use the following formula to return “Guard” or “Not Guard” instead:
<b>=IF(COUNTIF(A2,"*guar*"),"Guard","Not Guard")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/partial13.jpg"580">
Any rows with the partial text “guar” in the Team column all receive a value of <b>Guard </b>in the new column while all other rows receive a value of <b>Not Guard</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: A Simple Formula for “If Contains”</span></h2>
You can use the following formula in Excel to determine if a cell contains a certain string:
<b>=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("this",A1)), "Yes", "No")
</b>
In this example, if cell <b>A1</b> contains the string “<b>this</b>” then it will return a <b>Yes</b>, otherwise it will return a <b>No</b>.
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Check if Cell Contains a Certain String in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/contains11.jpg"458">
We can use the following formula to check if the value in the Team column contains the string “mavs”:
<b>=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("mavs",A2)), "Yes", "No")</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>C2</b> and then copy and paste it down to the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/contains12.jpg">
The three rows with a value of “mavs” in the Team column all receive a <b>Yes</b> in the new column while all other rows receive a <b>No</b>.
Note that the <b>SEARCH()</b> function in Excel is case-insensitive.
If you’d like to perform a <b>case-sensitive</b> search, you can swap out the <b>SEARCH()</b> function in the formula with the<b> FIND()</b> function.
For example, we could use the following formula to check if any value in the Team column is equal to “MAVS”:
<b>=IF(ISNUMBER(FIND("MAVS",A2)), "Yes", "No")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/contains13.jpg"524">
Notice that every value in the new column is equal to <b>No</b> because none of the team names match the uppercase “MAVS” string that we specified in the formula.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use an IF Function with Range of Values</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to create an IF function with a range of values in Excel:
<b>Method 1: Create IF Function with Range of Cells</b>
<b>=IF(COUNTIF(A2:A11,"Pacers")>0, "Exists", "Does Not Exist")
</b>
For this formula, if “Pacers” exists anywhere in the range <b>A2:A11</b> then the function returns “Exists.” Otherwise it returns “Does Not Exist.”
<b>Method 2: Create IF Function with Range of Numeric Values</b>
<b>=IF(((B2>=95)*(B2&lt;=105))=1, "Yes", "No")</b>
For this formula, if the value in cell <b>B2</b> is between 95 and 105, then the function returns “Yes.” Otherwise it returns “No.”
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice with the following dataset in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/range11.jpg"453">
<h2>Example 1: Create IF Function with Range of Cells</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to return “Exists” if the team name “Pacers” exists in the range <b>A2:A11</b> or to return “Does Not Exist” if the team name does not exist in the range:
<b>=IF(COUNTIF(A2:A11,"Pacers")>0, "Exists", "Does Not Exist")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/range12.jpg">
The formula returns “Exists” since the string “Pacers” occurs at least once in the range <b>A2:A11</b>.
<h2>Example 2: Create IF Function with Range of Numeric Values</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to return “Yes” if the value in the Points column is between 95 and 105:
<b>=IF(((B2>=95)*(B2&lt;=105))=1, "Yes", "No")</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/range13.jpg"573">
Here’s what the formula does for each row in column D:
If the value in the Points column is between 95 and 105, return Yes.
If the value in the Points column is <em>not</em> between 95 and 105, return No.
Also note that you can change the last two arguments in the IF function to something other than “Yes” or “No” if you’d like to return different output values.
<b>Note</b>: The multiplication symbol (<b>*</b>) in the IF function tells Excel that both conditions must be met in order to return “Yes.”

Else, if the value in the Points column is less than 20, return <b>OK</b>.
Else, if the value in the Points column is less than 25, return <b>Good</b>.
Else, return <b>Great</b>.
<h2>Example 2: IF Function with AND Logic</h2>
We can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to return “Yes” if three conditions are met for a specific player or “No” if at least one of the conditions is not met:

For this formula, if the value in cell <b>A2</b> is equal to or before 10/15/2022, the function returns “Yes.” Otherwise it returns “No.”
<b>Method 2: Create IF Function to Compare Dates in Two Cells</b>
<b>=IF(A2&lt;=B2, "Yes", "No")</b>
For this formula, if the date in cell <b>A2</b> is equal to or before the date in cell <b>B2</b>, the function returns “Yes.” Otherwise it returns “No.”
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice.
<h2>Example 1: IF Function to Compare Date in Cell with Specific Date</h2>
Suppose we have a list of dates in Excel that show when some task was done and we want to know if each task was done by 10/15/2022:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dateif1.jpg"506">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>B2</b> to return “Yes” if the task in cell <b>A2</b> was done before or on 10/15/2022 or to return “No” otherwise:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;=DATEVALUE("10/15/2022"), "Yes", "No")</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dateif2.jpg">
The formula returns either “Yes” or “No” depending on whether or not the date in column A is before or equal to 10/15/2022.
<b>Note</b>: The <b>DATEVALUE</b> function in Excel converts a date stored as a text value to a date that is recognizable by Excel formulas.

<b>=IF(A2>=B2, "Yes", "No")</b>
For this particular formula, if the value in cell <b>A2</b> is greater than or equal to the value in cell <b>B2</b>, the function returns “Yes.”
Otherwise it returns “No.”
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Create IF Function to Return Yes or No in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following two columns in Excel that show the sales and sales targets for ten different products:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ifexcel1.jpg"493">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b> to return “Yes” if the number of sales in cell <b>A2</b> is equal to or greater than the sales target in cell <b>B2</b>:
<b>=IF(A2>=B2, "Yes", "No")</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ifexcel2.jpg"464">
The formula returns either “Yes” or “No” depending on whether or not the sales value in column A is greater than or equal to the sales target in column B.
Note that you can place any logical test you’d like in the first argument of the IF function.
For example, you could use <b>&lt;></b> to test if the values in cell <b>A2</b> and <b>B2</b> are not equal to each other and return “Yes” if they’re not equal or “No” if they are equal:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>B2, "Yes", "No")</b>

You can use the following formula in Excel to perform some task if a cell is not empty:
<b>=IF(A1&lt;>"", Value_If_Not_Empty, Value_If_Empty)
</b>
This particular formula checks if cell <b>A1</b> is empty.
If it is not empty, then <b>Value_If_Not_Empty</b> is returned.

Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ifempty1.jpg"427">
We can use the following formula to return a value of “Team Exists” if the cell in column A is not empty. 
Otherwise, we’ll return a value of “Does Not Exist”:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>"", "Team Exists", "Does Not Exist")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ifempty2-1.jpg"598">
If the team name is not empty in column A, then “Team Exists” is returned.
Otherwise, “Does Not Exist” is returned.
If we’d like, we could also return numeric values instead of character values.
For example, we could use the following formula to return the value of the points column divided by two if the cell in column A is not empty.
Otherwise, we’ll return an empty value:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>"", B2/2, "")

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_zero_blank1.jpg"460">
Suppose we type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b> to calculate the return rate for product A:
<b>=B2/C2</b>
If we copy and paste this formula down to every cell in column D, we’ll see that some of the results are equal to zero:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_zero_blank2.jpg"491">
To return a blank value instead of a zero, we can type the following formula into cell <b>D2</b>:
<b>=IF(B2/C2=0, "", B2/C2)</b>
We can then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_zero_blank3.jpg"478">
Notice that every cell where the formula would return a zero now returns a blank value instead.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use IFERROR Then Blank</span></h2>
You can use the following methods in Excel to return a blank value instead of an error value when a valid value isn’t returned from a formula:
<b>Method 1: IFERROR Then Blank with Some Formula</b>
<b>=IFERROR(B2/A2, "")
</b>
<b>Method 2: IFERROR Then Blank with VLOOKUP</b>
<b>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(E2, $A$2:$C$12, 3, FALSE), "")
</b>
The following examples show how to use each method in practice.
<h3>Example 1: IFERROR Then Blank with Some Formula</h3>
Suppose we use the following formula to divide the values in column B by the values in column A in this particular Excel spreadsheet:
<b>=B2/A2</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iferror11-1.jpg"466">
Notice that for each cell in column C where we attempt to divide by a blank value, we receive <b>#DIV/0!</b> as a result.
To return a blank value instead of an error value, we can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b>:
<b>=IFERROR(A2/B2, "")</b>
We can then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iferror12.jpg"461">
Now for each cell in column C where we attempt to divide by a blank value, we simply receive a blank value as a result.
<h3>Example 2: IFERROR Then Blank with VLOOKUP</h3>
Suppose we use the following <b>VLOOKUP</b> formula to look up the player name in column A and return the rebounds value in column C:
<b>VLOOKUP(F2, $A$2:$C$12, 3, FALSE)</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iferror13.jpg"518">
Notice that for each cell in column G where we encounter an empty value in the <b>VLOOKUP</b> function, we receive <b>#N/A</b> as a result.
To return a blank value instead of a <b>#N/A</b> value, we can type the following formula into cell <b>F2</b>:
<b>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(F2, $A$2:$C$12, 3, FALSE), "")</b>
We can then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column F:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iferror14.jpg">
Now for each cell where we encounter an empty value in the <b>VLOOKUP</b> function, we simply receive a blank value as a result.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Ignore Blank Cells When Using Formulas in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas in Excel to ignore blank cells when performing calculations:
<b>Formula 1: Ignore Blank Cells in One Column</b>
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>"", A2+10, "")
</b>
This particular formula adds 10 to the value in cell <b>A2</b> only if the value in cell <b>A2</b> is not blank.
<b>Formula 2: Ignore Blank Cells in Multiple Columns</b>
<b>=IF(AND(A2&lt;>"", B2&lt;>""), A2+B2, "")
</b>
This particular formula adds the values in cells <b>A2</b> and <b>B2</b> only if both cells are not blank.
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Ignore Blank Cells in One Column</h3>
Suppose we have the following data in Excel that shows the points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank3.jpg"435">
Now suppose we use the following formula to add 10 to each of the values in column A:
<b>=A2+10</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank4-1.jpg"448">
Notice that 10 is added to each cell in column A even if the cell in column A is blank.
Instead, we can use the following formula to add 10 to each of the cells in column A and ignore the blank cells entirely:
<b>=IF(A2&lt;>"", A2+10, "")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank5.jpg"445">
Notice that 10 is only added to each cell in column A that is not blank.
<h3>Example 2: Ignore Blank Cells in Multiple Columns</h3>
Suppose we have the following data in Excel that shows the points scored and rebounds collected by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank6.jpg"488">
We can use the following formula to add the values in the points and rebounds columns only for the rows where both values are not empty:
<b>=IF(AND(A2&lt;>"", B2&lt;>""), A2+B2, "")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ignoreblank7.jpg"514">
Notice that the values for points and rebounds are added only for the rows where both values are not blank.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Ignore #DIV/0! When Using Division in Excel</span></h2>
In Excel, if you attempt to divide a value by zero you will receive <b>#DIV/0!</b> as a result.
You can use the following basic syntax to perform division while ignoring <b>#DIV/0!</b> values:
<b>=IFERROR(A2/B2, "")
</b>
In this particular formula, we attempt to divide the value in cell <b>A2</b> by the value in cell <b>B2</b>. If <b>B2</b> happens to be a zero, we simply return a blank as a result.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Ignore #DIV/0 When Using Division in Excel</h3>
Suppose we attempt to divide the values in column A by the values in column B in this particular Excel spreadsheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/div1.jpg"473">
Notice that for each cell in column C where we attempt to divide by zero, we receive <b>#DIV/0!</b> as a result.
To ignore this error, we can type the following formula into cell <b>C2</b>:
<b>=IFERROR(A2/B2, "")</b>
We can then copy and paste this formula down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/div2.jpg"477">
Now for each cell in column C where we attempt to divide by zero, we simply receive a blank value as a result.
Note that we could also use the following formula to return a zero as a result instead:
<b>=IFERROR(A2/B2, 0)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/div3.jpg"463">
Now for each cell in column C where we attempt to divide by zero, we simply receive a zero as a result.
Or we could even return a custom message when attempting to divide by zero:
<b>=IFERROR(A2/B2, "Tried to divide by zero")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/div4.jpg"574">
Now for each cell in column C where we attempt to divide by zero, we simply receive “Tried to divide by zero” as a result.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Ignore #N/A Values When Using Formulas in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to calculate the mean, median, sum, standard deviation, etc. in Excel while ignoring #N/A values:
<b>=AVERAGE(IFNA(A2:A21, "")) 
=MEDIAN(IFNA(A2:A21, ""))
=SUM(IFNA(A2:A21, ""))
=STDEV(IFNA(A2:A21, ""))
</b>
This syntax simply replaces #N/A values with blanks and then calculates the descriptive statistic you’re interested in.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Calculate Mean & Ignore #N/A Values</h3>
The following screenshot shows how to calculate the mean of a dataset that contains #N/A values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ignore1.png">
The mean of the dataset (ignoring all #N/A values) is <b>14.76</b>.
<h3>
<b>Example 2: Calculate Median & Ignore #N/A Values</b>

<h2><span class="orange">How to Ignore #VALUE! Error in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to perform some calculation in Excel and ignore any <b>#VALUE!</b> errors that may occur:
<b>IFERROR(some calculation, "")
</b>
This syntax simply replaces <b>#VALUE!</b> with a blank value.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in different scenarios.
<h2>Example 1: Perform Multiplication & Ignore #VALUE! Error</h2>
Suppose we have a list of values in column A and attempt to multiply each value by 2 in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ignorevalue1.jpg"433">
Notice that for each of the values in column A that aren’t a numeric value, the result of the multiplication in column B is a <b>#VALUE!</b> error.
We can use the following formula to perform this exact same multiplication but replace any <b>#VALUE!</b> errors with a blank value:
<b>=IFERROR(A2*2, "")</b>
We can type this formula into cell B2 and then click and drag it down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ignorevalue2.jpg">
Notice that any calculations that would have resulted in a <b>#VALUE!</b> error simply display a blank space now.
<h2>Example 2: Use FIND Function & Ignore #VALUE! Error</h2>
Suppose we have a list of basketball team names in column A and we attempt to use the <b>FIND</b> function in column B to find the starting position of the string “ets” within each team name:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ignorevalue3.jpg"439">
Notice that for each team that doesn’t have “ets” in the name that the formula returns a <b>#VALUE!</b> error.
We can use the following formula to perform this exact same function but replace any <b>#VALUE!</b> errors with a blank value:
<b>=IFERROR(FIND("ets", A2), "")</b>
We can type this formula into cell B2 and then click and drag it down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ignorevalue4.jpg"501">
Notice that any rows that would have resulted in a <b>#VALUE!</b> error simply display a blank space now.
<b>Note</b>: You can also display a different value instead of a blank space by simply changing the value in the last argument of the <b>IFERROR()</b> function to something other than double quotation marks.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Insert a Character into a String</span></h2>
Often you may want to insert a character into a specific position of a string in Excel.
You can use the <b>REPLACE </b>function with the following syntax to do so:
<b>=REPLACE(A2,5,0,"sometext")
</b>
This particular formula inserts “sometext” into the string in cell <b>A2</b> starting at position <b>5</b> of the string.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Insert Character into String in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the conference and team name of various basketball teams in the NBA:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/insert1.jpg"459">
Suppose we would like to insert “Conference” immediately after “East” in each string.
Since “East” is 4 characters long, we will use the following formula to insert “Conference” into the string starting at the fifth position:
<b>=REPLACE(A2,5,0," Conference")</b>
We will type this formula into cell <b>B2</b> and then click and drag the formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/insert2.jpg">
Notice that “Conference” has been inserted into each string starting at position 5.
Also note that we intentionally left a space in the beginning of ” Conference” so that there would be a space between “East” and “Conference” in each string.
<h2>How This Formula Works</h2>
The<b> REPLACE()</b> function in Excel uses the following syntax:
<b>REPLACE(old_text, start_num, num_chars, new_text)</b>
where:
<b>old_text</b>: The text to replace
<b>start_num</b>: Starting location in text to search
<b>num_chars</b>: The number of characters to replace
<b>new_text</b>: The text to replace old_text with
In our example, we used the following formula:
<b>REPLACE(A2, 5, 0, ” Conference”)</b>
Thus, our formula replaced <b>0</b> characters starting at position 5 in cell A2 and the text we used was “Conference” which had the effect of <em>inserting</em> this text starting at position 5 rather than <em>replacing</em> any text in the original string.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Create a Lag Function in Excel (With Examples)</span></h2>
Often you may want to calculate lagged values in Excel. Fortunately this is easy to do use the <b>OFFSET()</b> function.
The following examples show how to use the <b>OFFSET()</b> function in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Calculate Lagged Values in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the total sales made by some store in 10 consecutive days:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lag1.jpg"443">
We can use the following formula to calculate the lagged sales values in a new column:
<b>=OFFSET(B3, -1, 0)
</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>C3</b> and drag it down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lag2.jpg"516">
The “Lag Sales” column shows the sales for a lag of n=1. 
For example, on day 2 the store made <b>19</b> sales. The lagged value of sales on day 2 (e.g. the sales made on day 1) is <b>13</b> sales.
<h3>Example 2: Calculate Lagged Values by Group in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the total sales made by two different stores during 5 days each:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lag3.jpg"460">
We can use the following formula to calculate the lagged sales values by store in a new column:
<b>=IF(A3=A2, OFFSET(B3, -1, 0), "")
</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>C3</b> and drag it down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lag4.jpg"502">
This function first checks if the store value in the current row is equal to the store value in the previous row.
If it is, then it returns the lagged sales value. If it’s not, then it returns a blank.
For example, in row 3 the sales value was <b>19</b>. Since the store value in row 2 is equal to row 3, the lagged value of sales is calculated as <b>13</b>.
However, in row 7 the value for store does not match the value for store in row 6, so a blank value is returned instead of a lagged sales value.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: Use LEFT to Extract Text Before Comma</span></h2>
You can use the following formula with the <b>LEFT</b> and <b>FIND</b> function to extract all of the text before a comma is encountered in some cell in Excel:
<b>=LEFT(A2, FIND(",", A2)-1)</b>
This particular formula extracts all of the text in cell <b>A2</b> that occurs before the first comma is encountered.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Using LEFT to Extract Text Before Comma</h2>
Suppose we have the following list in Excel that provides a brief description of different basketball players including their team, position, and ranking:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/leftcomma1.jpg"517">
Now suppose that we would like to extract only the team name for each player.
To do so, we can use the following formula with the <b>LEFT</b> and <b>FIND</b> functions in Excel to extract the text from the left side of each cell until a comma is encountered:
<b>=LEFT(A2, FIND(",", A2)-1)</b>
We can type this formula into cell B2 and then click and drag this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/leftcomma2.jpg">
Column B now displays only the team name for each player in column A.
It’s worth noting that if no comma is found in the Player Description column, the formula will return <b>#VALUE!</b> as a result.
To return a different value, simply use the <b>IFERROR()</b> function.
For example, we can use the following <b>IFERROR()</b> function to return “No comma” if a comma is not found in a given player description:
<b>=IFERROR(LEFT(A2, FIND(",", A2)-1), "No comma")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/leftcomma3.jpg"604">
Note that you can also return a different value by simply replacing “No comma” with some other value in the <b>IFERROR()</b> function.

However, you can use the following formula to use the <b>LEFT</b> function to extract all characters from the left side of a string until a specific character is encountered: 
<b>=LEFT(cell, FIND("specific_character", cell)-1)
</b>
For example, you can use the following formula to extract all of the characters on the left side of the string in cell <b>A2</b> until an underscore is encountered:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use LINEST to Perform Multiple Linear Regression</span></h2>
You can use the <b>LINEST </b>function in Excel to fit a  multiple linear regression model  to a dataset.
This function uses the following basic syntax:
<b>=LINEST(known_y's, [known_x's], [const], [stats])</b>
where:
<b>known_y’s</b>: An array of known y-values
<b>known_x’s</b>: An array of known x-values
<b>const</b>: Optional argument. If TRUE, the constant b is treated normally. If FALSE, the constant b is set to 1.
<b>stats</b>: Optional argument. If TRUE, additional regression statistics are returned. If FALSE, additional regression statistics are not returned.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/linestmult1.jpg"472">
<h2>Step 2: Use LINEST to Fit Multiple Linear Regression Model</h2>
Suppose we would like to fit a multiple linear regression model using <b>x1</b>, <b>x2</b>, and <b>x3</b> as predictor variables and <b>y</b> as the response variable.
To do so, we can type the following formula into any cell to fit this multiple linear regression model
<b>=LINEST(D2:D14, A2:C14)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/linestmult2.jpg">
Here’s how to interpret the output:
The coefficient for the intercept is <b>28.5986</b>.
The coefficient for x1 is <b>0.34271</b>.
The coefficient for x2 is <b>-3.00393</b>.
The coefficient for x3 is <b>0.849687</b>.
Using these coefficients, we can write the fitted regression equation as:
<b>y = 28.5986 + 0.34271(x1) – 3.00393(x2) + 0.849687(x3)</b>
<h2>Step 3 (Optional): Display Additional Regression Statistics</h2>
We can also set the value for the <b>stats</b> argument in the <b>LINEST </b>function equal to <b>TRUE</b> to display additional regression statistics for the fitted regression equation:

The fitted regression equation is still the same:
<b>y = 28.5986 + 0.34271(x1) – 3.00393(x2) + 0.849687(x3)</b>
Here’s how to interpret the other values in the output:

<h2><span class="orange">How to Match Two Columns and Return a Third in Excel</span></h2>
Often you may want to match the values in two columns and output a third column in Excel.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>VLOOKUP()</b> function, which uses the following syntax:
<b>VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])</b>
where:
<b>lookup_value</b>: The value you want to look up.
<b>table_array</b>: The range of cells to look in.
<b>col_index_num</b>: The column number in the range that contains the return value.
<b>range_lookup</b>: Whether to find an approximate match (default) or exact match.
The following example shows how to use this function to match two columns and return a third in Excel.
<h3>Example: Match Two Columns and Return Third in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following datasets in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/match1.png">
Suppose we would like to match the team values in column A and column D and return the points values in column B into column E.
We can use the following VLOOKUP syntax to match the first value in column A:
<b>=VLOOKUP(D2, $A$2:$B$16, 2, FALSE)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this syntax in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/match2.png">
Notice that the ‘points’ value in column B that corresponds to ‘Suns’ is <b>96</b>, which is why this value is returned in column E.
We can then drag this formula down to every remaining cell in column E:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use MAX IF with Multiple Criteria</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to use MAX IF with multiple criteria in Excel:
<b>=MAX(IF(A2:A11="Mavs", IF(B2:B11="Forward", C2:C11)))
</b>
This particular formula finds the max value in the range <b>C2:C11</b> where the corresponding value in the range <b>A2:A11</b> is equal to “Mavs” and the corresponding value in the range <b>B2:B11</b> is equal to “Forward.”
The following examples shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: MAX IF with Multiple Criteria in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/maxif1.jpg"446">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b> to calculate the max value of players who are on the Mavs team and have a position of Forward:
<b>=MAX(IF(A2:A11="Mavs", IF(B2:B11="Forward", C2:C11)))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/maxif2.jpg"669">
We can see that the player with the max value for the Points column with a Team value of “Mavs” and Position value of “Forward” is <b>30</b>.
We can modify the values in quotation marks in the formula to find the max points among players who meet different criteria.
For example, we can type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b> to calculate the max value of players who are on the Heat team and have a position of Guard:
<b>=MAX(IF(A2:A11="Heat", IF(B2:B11="Guard", C2:C11)))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Find Max Value by Group</span></h2>
Often you may want to find the max value of some dataset in Excel based on a category or group.
For example, suppose we have the following dataset and we’d like to find the max value of “points” for each team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/max1.jpg"430">
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, enter the data values into Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/max1.jpg"430">
<h3>Step 2: Find the Unique Groups</h3>
Next, we need to use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> function to produce a list of unique team names.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>D2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(A2:A16)
</b>
This will produce a list of unique teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/max2.jpg"513">
<h3>Step 3: Find the Max Value by Group</h3>
Next, we will use the following formula to find the max points scored by each team:
<b>=MAX(IF(A:A=D2,B:B))
</b>
We will type this formula into cell <b>E2</b> and then copy and paste it down to the remaining cells in column E:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/max3.jpg"469">
This tells us:
The max points scored by players on the Mavs is <b>26</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Warriors is <b>19</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Lakers is <b>33</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Heat is <b>19</b>.
The max points scored by players on the Celtics is <b>29</b>.
<b>Note</b>: To calculate the minimum points scored by each team, simply replace the <b>MAX</b> in the formula with <b>MIN</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate the Median by Group in Excel</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate the median value by group in Excel.
<b>Related:</b>  How to Calculate the Average by Group in Excel 
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset that shows the total points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/medianby1.jpg"472">
Now suppose we’d like to find the median value of the points scored, grouped by team.
To do so, we can use the <b>UNIQUE()</b> function to first create a list of the unique teams.
We’ll type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(B2:B12)</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, a list of unique team names will be displayed:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/medianby2.jpg"500">
Next, we can use the following formula to find the median value of points scored by players on each team:
<b>=MEDIAN(IF($B$2:$B$12=E2, $C$2:$C$12))
</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>F2</b> and copy and paste it down to each remaining cell in column F:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/medianby3.jpg"564">
Column E displays each of the unique teams and column F displays the median value of the points scored by each team.
From the output we can see:
Median value of points for Lakers players: <b>16</b>
Median value of points for Mavericks players: <b>25</b>
Median value of points for Spurs players: <b>30.5</b>
We can verify these results are correct by manually calculating the median for one of the teams.
For example, the points scored by players on the Spurs team is: 14, 28, 33, 35
The median value would be the value directly in the middle of 28 and 33, which is <b>30.5</b>.
This matches the value calculated using the formula.

You can use the following syntax to calculate the median value of a filtered range in Excel:
<b>=AGGREGATE(12,1,B2:B13)
</b>
The value <b>12</b> is a  shortcut  for calculating the median of a range and the value <b>1</b> tells Excel to ignore hidden rows.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h2>Example: Calculate Median of Filtered Rows in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the number of sales made during various days by a company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/filtermonth1.jpg"480">
Next, let’s filter the data to only show the dates that are in January or April.
To do so, highlight the cell range <b>A1:B13</b>. Then click the <b>Data </b>tab along the top ribbon and click the <b>Filter</b> button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/filtermonth2-1.jpg"542">
Then click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Date </b>and make sure that only the boxes next to January and April are checked, then click <b>OK</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countfilter1.jpg"439">
The data will automatically be filtered to only show the rows where the dates are in January or April:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/countfilter2.jpg"450">
If we attempt to use the <b>MEDIAN()</b> function to find the average value in the Sales column, it will actually return the median of all of the original values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/median1.jpg"473">
Instead, we can use the <b>AGGREGATE()</b> function:

This function calculates the median of only the visible rows.
We can manually verify this by calculating the median of the visible rows:
Median of Sales in visible rows: [9, 13, <b>14</b>, 14, 19]
When the values are arranged in ascending order, the value located in the middle is indeed <b>14</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: A Formula for MID From Right</span></h2>
The <b>MID</b> function in Excel allows you to extract a specific number of characters from a string based on a starting position on the left side of the string.
However, you can use the following formula to replicate the <b>MID</b> function and extract a specific number of characters using a starting position on the <b>right side</b> of the string:
<b>=RIGHT(REPLACE(A1, LEN(A1)-start_from_right+2, LEN(A1),""), num_characters)
</b>
For example, you can use the following formula to extract the 4 middle characters in cell <b>A1</b> starting 3 positions from the right:
<b>=RIGHT(REPLACE(A1,LEN(A1)-3+2,LEN(A1),""), 4)</b>
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Using MID From Right in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of basketball team names in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mid1.jpg"509">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>B2</b> to extract the 4 middle characters from the team name in cell <b>A2</b> starting 3 positions from the right:
<b>=RIGHT(REPLACE(A2,LEN(A2)-3+2,LEN(A2),""), 4)</b>
We can then click and drag this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mid2.jpg">
Column B now displays the 4 middle characters from each team name starting 3 positions from the right.
For example, consider the first team name:
Mavericks
The 3rd position from the right is the letter <b>c</b>:
Maveri<b>c</b>ks
We then extract the 4 characters starting from this position:
Mav<b>eric</b>ks
The result is <b>eric</b>.
The formula repeats this process for each name in the Team column.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use MID Function to End of String</span></h2>
The <b>MID</b> function in Excel allows you to extract a specific number of characters from a string based on a starting position on the left side of the string.
However, sometimes you want to extract middle characters based on a specific starting character all the way to the end of the string.
You can use the <b>MID</b> function combined with the <b>LEN </b>function to do so:
<b>=MID(A2, 3, LEN(A2))
</b>
This particular formula extracts every character in the string in cell <b>A2</b> starting from the 3rd character all the way to the last character in the string.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: How to Use MID Function to End of String in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of basketball team names:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mid1.jpg"498">
Suppose we would like to extract the characters from each team ranging from the 3rd character to the last.

The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mid3.jpg"513">
Column B now displays the characters from each team ranging from the 3rd character to the last.
Note that the <b>LEN()</b> function in Excel is used to find the length of a string.
Thus, our formula tells excel to extract the characters in each string ranging from the 3rd character to the character that represents the entire length of the string.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use MID Function for Variable Length Strings</span></h2>
The <b>MID</b> function in Excel allows you to extract a specific number of characters from a string based on a starting position on the left side of the string.
However, sometimes you want to extract middle characters based on a specific starting and ending character.
You can use the <b>MID</b> function combined with the <b>FIND</b> function to do so:
<b>=MID(A2,FIND("char1",A2)+2,FIND("char2",A2,10)-FIND("char1",A2)-2)
</b>
This particular formula extracts every character in the string in cell <b>A2</b> between the characters <b>char1</b> and <b>char2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: MID Function for Variable Length Strings in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of websites URL’s:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/var1.jpg"525">
Suppose we would like to extract only the website name between the double forward slashes (<b>//</b>) and the <b>.com</b> near the end of the URL.
We can use the following formula to do so:
<b>=MID(A2,FIND("//",A2)+2,FIND(".com",A2,10)-FIND("//",A2)-2)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:

Column B now displays only the characters in the website name between the double slashes <b>//</b> and the <b>.com</b> near the end of the name.
Note that this formula works even though the length of each website name is not the same.
Without using the <b>FIND</b> function, the <b>MID</b> function alone would not be able to perform this task.

For example, to multiply by 90% simply use the following formula:
<b>=A2*(90/100)</b>
Then click and drag this formula down to all of the remaining cells in column B.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/multexcel7.jpg"514">
Each value in column B will now be equal to the corresponding values in column A multiplied by 90%.
For example:
10 * 90% = <b>9</b>.
15 * 90% = <b>13.5</b>.
18 * 90% = <b>16.2</b>.
20 * 90% = <b>18</b>.
25 * 90% = <b>22.5</b>.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Fix the #NAME Error in Excel (3 Examples)</span></h2>
There are three common reasons why you may encounter the <b>#NAME?</b> error in Excel:
<b>1.</b> You mistyped a formula.
<b>2.</b> You left out a colon in a range reference.
<b>3</b>. You left out quotation marks for text values.
The following examples show how to fix each error in practice.
<h3>Example 1: You Mistyped a Formula</h3>
Suppose we attempt to calculate the average value in column B using the following formula:
<b>=AVERAG(B2:B15)</b>
We will receive a <b>#NAME?</b> error since we mistyped AVERAGE in the formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/name1.jpg"445">
To correct this error, we simply need to make sure we spell the formula correctly:
<b>=AVERAGE(B2:B15)</b>
This time we’re able to successfully calculate the average value in column B without an error:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/name2.jpg"448">
<h3>Example 2: You Left Out a Colon in a Range Reference</h3>
Suppose we attempt to count the number of teams with a value of “Thunder” in column A using the following formula:
<b>=COUNTIF(A2A15, "Thunder")</b>
We will receive a <b>#NAME?</b> error since we left out a colon in the range reference:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/name3.jpg">
To correct this error, we simply need to make sure we include a colon in the range reference:
<b>=COUNTIF(A2:A15, "Thunder")</b>
This time we’re able to successfully count the number of teams with a value of “Thunder” in column A without an error:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/name4.jpg"490">
<h3>Example 3: You Left Out Quotation Marks for Text Values</h3>
Suppose we attempt to concatenate the values in column A and column B using the following formula:
<b>=CONCAT(A2, scored, B2)</b>
We will receive a <b>#NAME?</b> error since we left out quotation marks around “scored” in the formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/name5.jpg"482">
To correct this error, we simply need to make sure we include quotation marks around “scored” in the formula:
<b>=CONCAT(A2, " scored ", B2)</b>
This time we’re able to successfully concatenate the values in column A and column B without an error:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/name6.jpg"461">
<h2><span class="orange">How to Write a Nested IFERROR Statement in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to write a nested IFERROR statement in Excel:
<b>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(G2,A2:B6,2,0),IFERROR(VLOOKUP(G2,D2:E6,2,0), ""))</b>
This particular formula looks for the value in cell <b>G2</b> in the range <b>A2:B6</b> and attempts to return the corresponding value in the second column of that range.
If the value in cell <b>G2</b> is not found in the first range, Excel will then look for it in the range <b>D2:E6</b> and return the corresponding value in the second column of that range.
If the value in cell <b>G2</b> is also not found in that range, a blank is returned.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Write a Nested IFERROR Statement in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following datasets in Excel that contain information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nested_iferror1.jpg"530">
We can write the following nested IFERROR statement to return the points values associated with various teams:
<b>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(G2,$A$2:$B$6,2,0),IFERROR(VLOOKUP(G2,$D$2:$E$6,2,0), ""))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nested_iferror2.jpg">
This formula first looks for the team name in column G in the range <b>A2:B6</b> and attempts to return the corresponding points value.
If the formula doesn’t find the team name in the range <b>A2:B6</b>, it then looks in the range <b>D2:E6</b> and attempts to return the corresponding points value.
If it doesn’t find the team name in either range, it simply returns a blank value.
We can see that the team name “Kings” doesn’t exist in either range so the points value for that team is simply a blank value.
<b>Note</b>: For this example we created a nested IFERROR statement with two VLOOKUP functions, but we could use however many VLOOKUP functions we’d like depending on how many unique ranges we’re dealing with.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Percent Complete in Excel</span></h2>
Often you may want to calculate the completion percentage of a project in Excel.
This tutorial provides two examples of how to calculate completion percentage in different scenarios.
<h2>Example 1: Calculate Percent Complete Based on Missing Cells</h2>
Suppose we have a list of tasks along with their status in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/comp1.jpg"490">
To calculate the percentage of tasks that we’ve completed, we can use the following formula:
<b>=COUNTA(B2:B11)/COUNTA(A2:A11)</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>D2</b> and then press <b>Enter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/comp2.jpg"564">
From the output we can see that <b>0.3</b> or <b>30%</b> of the tasks have been completed.
To format the number as a percentage, click the <b>Number Format</b> dropdown menu on the <b>Home</b> tab in Excel and choose <b>Percentage</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/comp3.jpg"416">
The number will automatically be formatted as a percentage:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/comp4.jpg">
Note that the <b>COUNTA</b> function counts the number of cells in a range that are not empty.
Thus, in this formula we are simply counting the number of non-empty cells in the <b>Status</b> column and dividing by the number of non-empty cells in the <b>Task</b> column to come up with a completion percentage.
<h2>
<b>Example 2: Calculate Percent Complete Based on Text in Cells</b>
</h2>
Suppose we have a list of tasks along with their status in Excel:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Filter Pivot Table by Date Range</span></h2>
Often you may want to filter the rows in a pivot table in Excel by a specific date range.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>Date Filters</b> option in the dropdown menu within the <b>Row Labels</b> column of a pivot table.
The following example shows exactly how to do so.
<h2>Example: Filter Pivot Table by Date Range in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of sales on various dates:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotsortdate1.jpg"465">
Before creating a pivot table for this data, click on one of the cells in the Date column and make sure that Excel recognizes the cell as a <b>Date</b> format:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotsortdate2.jpg"538">
Next, we can highlight the cell range <b>A1:B10</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click <b>PivotTable</b>, and insert the following pivot table to summarize the total sales for each date:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotsortdate3.jpg"485">
Now suppose we would like to filter the pivot table to only show the dates between 1/5/2022 and 1/13/2022.
To apply this filter, click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Row Labels</b>, then click <b>Date Filters</b>, then click <b>Between</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/filterdaterange1.jpg">

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Filter Data in Pivot Table Using “Greater Than”</span></h2>
Often you may want to filter values in a pivot table in Excel using a “Greater Than” filter.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>Value Filters</b> dropdown menu within the <b>Row Labels</b> column of a pivot table.
The following example shows exactly how to do so.
<h3>Example: Filter Data in Pivot Table Using “Greater Than”</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of sales of four different products:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotgreater1.jpg"478">
Now suppose we create the following pivot table to summarize the total sales for each product:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Filter Pivot Table Using OR Condition</span></h2>
Often you may want to filter the values in a pivot table in Excel using an OR condition.
The following example shows exactly how to do so.
<h3>Example: Filter Pivot Table Using OR Condition</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of points scored by various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/filteror1.jpg"463">
Now suppose we’d like to create a pivot table to summarize the total points scored by team and position.
Also suppose we eventually want to filter for players who are on the <b>Mavs</b> team <b>or</b> have a position of <b>Guard</b>.
We can create a helper column by typing the following formula into cell D2:
<b>=IF(OR(A2="Mavs", B2="Guard"), "Show", "Hide")
</b>
We can then drag this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/filteror2.jpg"541">
Now that we’ve created this helper column, we can create the pivot table.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/filteror7.jpg">
By creating a helper column before we created the pivot table, we were able to filter the pivot table using an OR condition.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Group Values in Pivot Table by Uneven Intervals</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to group values in a pivot table in Excel by uneven intervals.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the following data about 15 different stores:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gp1.jpg"384">
<h3>Step 2: Create Helper Column</h3>
Suppose we’d like to create a pivot table to display the sum of sales by the follow intervals of store square footage:
100-124 sq. feet
125-149 sq. feet
150-199 sq. feet
200+ sq. feet
Notice that each interval does not have the same length.
In order to create a pivot table where we group by intervals of different length, we’ll first need to create a helper column that classifies each store into one of these intervals.
We can use the following formula to do so:
<b>=IF(B2&lt;125, "100-124", IF(B2&lt;150, "125-149", IF(B2&lt;200, "150-199","200+"))) </b>

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Apply Multiple Filters to Pivot Table at Once</span></h2>
By default, Excel only allows you to apply one filter per field in a pivot table.
However, we can change this default setting by using the <b>PivotTable Options</b> button.
The following example shows exactly how to do so.
<h2>Example: Apply Multiple Filters to Excel Pivot Table</h2>
Suppose we have the following pivot table in Excel that shows the total sales of various products:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple1.jpg"435">
Now suppose we click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Row Labels</b>, then click <b>Label Filters</b>, then click <b>Contains</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple1-1.jpg"442">
And suppose we choose to filter for rows that contain “shirt” in the row label:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple2.jpg"458">
Now suppose we would also like to filter for rows where the sum of sales is greater than 10.
We can click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Row Labels</b>, then click <b>Value Filters</b>, then click <b>Greater Than</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple3.jpg"461">
We can then filter for rows where the sum of sales is greater than 10:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple4.jpg"458">
However, notice that the previous label filter has been removed.
By default, Excel does not allow multiple filters in one field in a pivot table.
To change this, we can right click on any cell in the pivot table and then click <b>PivotTable Options</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple5.jpg"376">
In the new window that appears, click the <b>Totals & Filters</b> tab, then check the box next to <b>Allow multiple filters per field</b>, then click <b>OK</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple6.jpg">
Now if we filter once again for rows that contain “shirt” then Excel will allow this label filter and the previous value filter to be applied at once:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotmultiple7.jpg"478">
Notice that we’re able to filter the pivot table to only show rows that contain “shirt” <em>and</em> where the sum of sales is greater than 10.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Create Pivot Table from Multiple Sheets</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to create a pivot table from multiple sheets in Excel
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
Suppose we have a spreadsheet with two sheets titled <b>week1</b> and <b>week2</b>:
<b>Week1:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pivotsheets1.jpg"556">
<b>Week2:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pivotsheets2.jpg"556">
Suppose we would like to create a pivot table using data from both sheets.
<h2>Step 2: Consolidate Data into One Sheet</h2>
Before we can create a pivot table using both sheets, we must consolidate all of the data into one sheet.
We can use the following <b>FILTER </b>formula to do so:
<b>=FILTER(week2!A2:C11, week2!A2:A11&lt;>"")
</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>A12</b> of the <b>week1</b> sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pivotsheets3.jpg"574">
This formula tells Excel to return all of the rows from the <b>week2</b> sheet where the value in the range<b> A2:A11</b> of that sheet is not blank.
All of the rows from the <b>week1</b> and <b>week2</b> sheets are now consolidated into one sheet.
<h2>Step 3: Create the Pivot Table</h2>
To create the pivot table, click the <b>Insert</b> tab, then click <b>PivotTable</b> within the <b>Tables</b> group.
In the new window that appears, type in the following information and then click <b>OK</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pivotsheets4.jpg"629">
In the <b>PivotTable Fields</b> panel that appears on the right side of the screen, drag <b>Store</b> to the Rows box, drag <b>Product</b> to the Columns box, and drag <b>Sales</b> to the Values box:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pivotsheets5.jpg"375">
The following pivot table will automatically be created:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pivotsheets6.jpg"463">
The final pivot table includes data from both the <b>week1</b> and <b>week2</b> sheets.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Create Pivot Table Based on Filtered Data</span></h2>
By default, Excel is unable to create a pivot table using filtered data.
Instead, Excel always uses the original data to create a pivot table rather than the filtered data.
One way to get around this issue is to simply copy and paste the filtered data to a new cell range and then create a pivot table using the new cell range.
The following example shows exactly how to do so.
<h2>Example: Create Pivot Table Based on Filtered Data</h2>
Suppose we have the following data in Excel that shows the points scored by basketball players on various teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotfiltered1.jpg"446">
Now suppose we highlight the cell range <b>A1:B12</b>, then click the <b>Data</b> tab, then click the <b>Filter</b> icon.
Now suppose we click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Team</b>, check the boxes next to Mavs and Warriors, and then click <b>OK</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotfiltered2.jpg"433">
The data will be filtered to only show rows where the Team is equal to Mavs or Warriors:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotfiltered3.jpg"455">
If we attempt to create a pivot table to summarize the sum of points scored by these two teams, the pivot table will actually use all of the original data:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotfiltered4.jpg"481">
To get around this issue, we need to highlight and copy the cells in the range <b>A1:B12</b>, then paste them in a different cell range.
For this example, we’ll paste them into a new sheet entirely:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pivotfiltered5.jpg"432">
Now if we highlight the cell range<b> A1:B8</b> in this sheet and insert a pivot table, it will only contain the filtered data:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/diff2.jpg"446">
<h2>Step 3: Calculate Percentage Difference Between Two Columns in the Pivot Table</h2>
Suppose we would like to create a new column in the pivot table that displays the percentage difference between the <b>Sum of 2021 </b>and <b>Sum of 2022 </b>columns.
To do so, we need to add a calculated field to the pivot table by clicking on any value in the pivot table, then clicking the <b>PivotTable Analyze</b> tab, then clicking <b>Fields, Items & Sets</b>, then <b>Calculated Field</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/subtract5.jpg"535">
In the new window that appears, type “Percentage Difference” in the Name field, then type the following in the Formula field:
<b>= ('2022' - '2021') / '2021'
</b>
Then click <b>Add</b>, then click <b>OK</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/diff3-1.jpg"585">
This calculated field will automatically be added to the pivot table:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/diff4.jpg"541">
This new field displays the percentage difference between the 2022 and 2021 sales for each store.
For example:
There was a <b>16.67%</b> increase in sales between 2021 and 2022 for store A.
There was a <b>15.44%</b> increase in sales between 2021 and 2022 for store B.
There was a <b>24.62%</b> increase in sales between 2021 and 2022 for store C.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Calculate a Weighted Average in Pivot Table</span></h2>
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate a weighted average within a pivot table in Excel.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset that contains information about basketball players on two different teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt1.jpg"415">
<h2>Step 2: Create Helper Column</h2>
Suppose we would like to create a pivot table that summarizes the sum of games for each team along with the average points scored per player on each team.
To calculate the average points scored per player, we will need to use a weighted average that takes into account the average points along with the total games.
Since pivot tables in Excel don’t allow you to calculate weighted averages, we will need to first create a helper column in our original dataset.
We can type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b>:
<b>=C2*D2
</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to the remaining cells in column E:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt2.jpg"419">
<h2>Step 3: Create the Pivot Table</h2>
To create the pivot table, we’ll highlight the cells in the range <b>A1:E9</b>, then click the <b>PivotTable</b> icon within the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon.
In the PivotTable fields panel that appears, we’ll drag <b>Team</b> to the rows box and <b>Games</b> to the Values box:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt3.jpg"360">
The following pivot table will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt4.jpg"646">
<h2>Step 4: Add Weighted Average Column to Pivot Table</h2>
To add a weighted average column that shows the average points per game per player for each team, click any cell in the pivot table, then click the icon called <b>Fields, Items, & Sets</b> within the <b>PivotTable Analyze</b> tab, then click <b>Calculated Field</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt5.jpg"457">
In the new window that appears, type <b>=  Helper / Games</b> in the Formula box, then click <b>OK</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt6.jpg"537">
A new column that shows the average points per game per player for each team will be added to the pivot table:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wt7.jpg">
We can confirm that the average points per game per player is correct by manually calculating it from the original dataset.
For example, we could calculate the average points per game per player for team A as:
Avg Points per Game per Player: (22*3 + 20*4 + 15*4 + 13*5) / (3+4+4+5) = <b>16.9375</b>
This matches the value that appears in the pivot table.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Fit a Polynomial Curve in Excel (Step-by-Step)</span></h2>
You can use the <b>LINEST()</b> function in Excel to fit a polynomial curve with a certain degree.
For example, you can use the following basic syntax to fit a polynomial curve with a degree of 3:
<b>=LINEST(known_ys, known_xs^{1, 2, 3})
</b>
The function returns an array of coefficients that describes the polynomial fit.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this function to fit a polynomial curve in Excel.
<h3>Step 1: Create the Data</h3>
First, let’s create some data to work with:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/polyFit1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Fit a Polynomial Curve</h3>
Next, let’s use the <b>LINEST()</b> function to fit a polynomial curve with a degree of 3 to the dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/polyFit2.png">
<h3>Step 3: Interpret the Polynomial Curve</h3>
Once we press <b>ENTER</b>, an array of coefficients will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/polyFit3.png">
Using these coefficients, we can construct the following equation to describe the relationship between x and y:
y = .0218x<sup>3</sup> – .2239x<sup>2</sup> – .6084x + 30.0915
We can also use this equation to calculate the expected value of y, based on the value of x.
For example, suppose x = 4. The expected value of y would be:
y = .0218(4)<sup>3</sup> – .2239(4)<sup>2</sup> – .6084(4) + 30.0915 = <b>25.47</b>
<h2><span class="orange">How to Create Progress Bars in Excel (Step-by-Step)</span></h2>

Then choose any color you’d like for the bars. We’ll choose light green:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/progress3.jpg"652">
Once you click <b>OK</b>, a progress bar will appear in each cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/progress4.jpg"444">
<h3>Step 3: Format the Progress Bars</h3>
Lastly, we can stretch out the column width and row width in our Excel spreadsheet so that the progress bars become larger and easier to read.
We can also add a border around the cells and align the text for the percentages to be on the left side of the cells:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/progress5.jpg"594">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/randomcriteria1.jpg"471">
<h3>Example 1: Randomly Select Cell Based on One Criteria</h3>
We can use the following formula to randomly select one player who is on the Mavs team:
<b>=INDEX(A2:A14,LARGE(IF(B2:B14=A17,ROW(B2:B14)-ROW(B2)+1),INT(RAND()*COUNTIF(B2:B14,A17)+1)))</b>
This particular formula will randomly select one cell from the range <b>A2:A14</b> where the corresponding cell in the range <b>B2:B14</b> is equal to the value in cell <b>A17</b>.
We can type this formula into cell <b>A20</b> and then press <b>Ctrl</b> + <b>Shift</b> + <b>Enter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/randomcriteria2.jpg">
We can see that the formula randomly selected Luka, who is a player on the Mavs team.
Feel free to double click cell <b>A20</b> and press <b>Enter</b> to run the formula again.
Each time we run the formula, it’s possible that we will get a different player on the Mavs team.
<h3>Example 2: Randomly Select Cell Based on Multiple Criteria</h3>
We can use the following formula to randomly select one player who is on the Mavs team <b>and</b> is a Guard:
<b>=INDIRECT("A"&LARGE(IF($B$2:$B$14=$A$17,IF($C$2:$C$14=$B$17,ROW($A$2:$A$14),0),0), RANDBETWEEN(1,COUNTIFS(B2:B14,A17,C2:C14,B17))))</b>
This particular formula will randomly select one cell from the range <b>A2:A14</b> where the cell in range <b>B2:B14</b> is equal to the value in cell <b>A17</b> and the cell in range <b>C2:C14</b> is equal to the value in cell <b>B17</b>.
We can type this formula into cell <b>A20</b> and then press <b>Ctrl</b> + <b>Shift</b> + <b>Enter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/randomcriteria3.jpg"484">
We can see that the formula randomly selected Reggie, who is a guard on the Mavs team.
Feel free to double click cell <b>A20</b> and press <b>Enter</b> to run the formula again.
Each time we run the formula, it’s possible that we will get a different guard on the Mavs team.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Rank Values by Group in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to rank values by group in Excel:
<b>Formula 1: Rank Values by Group</b>
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(($A$2:$A$13=A2)*($B$2:$B$13>B2))+1
</b>
This particular formula finds the rank of the value in cell <b>B2</b> that belongs to the group in cell <b>A2</b>.
This formula assigns a rank of 1 to the largest value, 2 to the second largest value, etc.
<b>Formula 2: Rank Values by Group (Reverse Order)</b>
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(($A$2:$A$13=A2)*($B$2:$B$13&lt;B2))+1</b>
This particular formula finds the reverse rank of the value in cell <b>B2</b> that belongs to the group in cell <b>A2</b>.
This formula assigns a rank of 1 to the smallest value, 2 to the second smallest value, etc.
The following examples show how to use each formula in Excel.
<h3>Example 1: Rank Values by Group in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the points scored by basketball players on various teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rankgroup1.jpg"476">
We can use the following formula to rank the points by team:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(($A$2:$A$13=A2)*($B$2:$B$13>B2))+1</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>C2</b>, then copy and paste the formula down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rankgroup2.jpg">
Here’s how to interpret the values in column C:
The player with <b>22</b> points for the Mavs has the 2nd largest points value among Mavericks players.
The player with <b>28</b> points for the Mavs has the 1st largest points value among Mavericks players.
The player with <b>31 </b>points for the Spurs has the 2nd largest points value among Spurs players.
And so on.
<h3>Example 2: Rank Values by Group (Reverse Order) in Excel</h3>
Once again suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the points scored by basketball players on various teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rankgroup1.jpg"476">
We can use the following formula to rank the points in reverse order by team:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(($A$2:$A$13=A2)*($B$2:$B$13&lt;B2))+1</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>C2</b>, then copy and paste the formula down to every remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rankgroup3.jpg"616">
Here’s how to interpret the values in column C:
The player with <b>22</b> points for the Mavs has the 3rd smallest points value among Mavericks players.
The player with <b>28</b> points for the Mavs has the 4th smallest points value among Mavericks players.
The player with <b>31 </b>points for the Spurs has the 4th smallest points value among Spurs players.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Rank Items by Multiple Criteria in Excel</span></h2>
You can use a combination of the <b>RANK.EQ()</b> function and the <b>COUNTIFS()</b> function in Excel to rank items by multiple criteria.
The following example shows how to use these functions to rank items in a list by multiple criteria in Excel.
<h3>Example: Rank by Multiple Criteria in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the total points and assists for eight different basketball players.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rankMult1.png">
Now suppose we’d like to rank each player using the following criteria:
First, rank each player based on points.
Then, rank each player based on assists.
We can use the following formula to perform this multiple criteria ranking:
<b>=RANK.EQ($B2, $B$2:$B$9) + COUNTIFS($B$2:$B$9, $B2, $C$2:$C$9, ">" &$C2)
</b>
We can type this formula into cell D2 of our spreadsheet, then copy and paste the formula down to every other cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rankMult2-1.png">
From the output we can see that Andy receives a rank of <b>1</b> because he is tied for the most points with Bernard. However, Andy has more assists than Bernard, so he receives a rank of <b>1</b> while Bernard receives a rank of <b>2</b>.
Each player is ranked in a similar manner, first based on their total points and then based on their total assists.
If we instead would like to perform multiple criteria ranking in <b>reverse order</b> (the “best” player gets the highest ranking) then we can use the following formula:
<b>=RANK.EQ($B2, $B$2:$B$9, 1) + COUNTIFS($B$2:$B$9, $B2, $C$2:$C$9, "&lt;" &$C2)
</b>
We can type this formula into cell D2, then copy and paste the formula down to every other cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rankMult3.png">
Notice that the rankings are completely reversed from the previous example. The player with the most points and assists (Andy) now has a ranking of <b>8</b>.
Similarly, Bernard now has a ranking of <b>7</b>. And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Remove Duplicate Rows Based on Two Columns</span></h2>
Often you may want to remove duplicate rows based on two columns in Excel.
Fortunately this is easy to do using the <b>Remove Duplicates </b>function within the <b>Data</b> tab.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Remove Duplicates Based on Two Columns in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the team name and position of various basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/removedup1.jpg"421">
Notice that there are several duplicates across both columns.
For example:
There are multiple players who have a team of <b>A</b> and a position of <b>Guard</b>.
There are multiple players who have a team of <b>A</b> and a position of <b>Forward</b>.
And so on.
To remove these rows that have duplicates across two columns, we need to highlight the cell range <b>A1:B16</b> and then click the <b>Data</b> tab along the top ribbon and then click <b>Remove Duplicates</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/removedup2.jpg"679">
In the new window that appears, make sure the box is checked next to <b>My data has headers</b> and make sure the boxes next to <b>Team</b> and <b>Position</b> are both checked:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/removedup3.jpg"543">
Once you click <b>OK</b>, the rows with duplicate values across both columns will automatically be removed:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/removedup4.jpg"555">
Excel tells us that <b>6</b> duplicate rows were found and removed and that <b>9</b> unique rows remain.
Notice that none of the remaining rows have duplicate values across both columns.
For example:
There is only one row where Team is equal to <b>A</b> and Position is equal to <b>Guard</b>.
There is only one row where Team is equal to <b>A</b> and Position is equal to <b>Forward</b>.
And so on.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Remove Duplicates and Keep First One</span></h2>
There are two ways to remove duplicates in Excel while keeping the first occurrence:
<b>Method 1: Use the Remove Duplicates Button</b>
<b>Method 2: Use the UNIQUE() Function</b>
The following examples shows how to use each method in practice with the following dataset in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removedup1.jpg"504">
<h2>Example 1: Use the Remove Duplicates Button</h2>
One way to remove duplicate rows in Excel while keeping the first occurrence is by using the <b>Remove Duplicates</b> button in the  <b>Data</b> tab.
First, highlight the cells in the range <b>A1:B10</b>.
Then, click the <b>Data</b> tab along the top ribbon and then click the <b>Remove Duplicates</b> button in the <b>Data Tools</b> group:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removedup2.jpg"670">
In the new window that appears, check the box next to each column name:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removedup3.jpg"558">
Once you press <b>OK</b>, the duplicate rows will automatically be removed:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removedup4.jpg"566">
We can see that Excel removed <b>3</b> duplicate rows and <b>6</b> unique rows were left.
<h2>Example 2: Use the UNIQUE() Function</h2>
Another way to remove duplicate rows in Excel while keeping the first occurrence is by using the <b>UNIQUE()</b> function.
In this particular example, we can type the following formula into cell D1:
<b>=UNIQUE(A1:B10, FALSE, FALSE) </b>
Once we press Enter, a list of unique rows from the range <b>A1:B10</b> will automatically be shown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removedup5.jpg">
Notice that each of the duplicate rows have been removed while the unique rows remain.
This approach is particularly useful if you want to keep your original dataset while also creating a copy with only unique rows.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Remove First 3 Characters from String</span></h2>
Often you may want to remove the first 3 characters from a string in Excel.
You can use the <b>RIGHT </b>function combined with the <b>LEN </b>function to do so:
<b>=RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-3)
</b>
This particular formula removes the first 3 characters from the string in cell <b>A2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Remove First 3 Characters from String in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of basketball team names:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mid1.jpg"498">
Suppose we would like to remove the first three characters from each team name.
We can type the following formula into cell <b>B2</b> to do so:
<b>=RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-3)</b>
We can then click and drag this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/re1.jpg">
Column B now displays the team names in column A with the first three characters removed from each team name.
<h2>How This Formula Works</h2>
The<b> RIGHT()</b> function in Excel extracts a specific number of characters from the right side of a string.
The <b>LEN()</b> function in Excel is used to find the length of a string.
Thus, our formula tells Excel to extract the amount of characters equal to the length of the string minus three characters.
Thus, our formula displays the entire string with the first three characters removed.
<b>Note</b>: Blank spaces at the start of a string count as characters. You may need to first remove blank spaces to get your desired result.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Remove Grand Total from Pivot Table</span></h2>
Often you may want to remove the grand total row from a pivot table in Excel.
Fortunately this is easy to do by using the <b>Grand Totals</b> button within the <b>Design</b> tab.
The following example shows exactly how to do so.
<h2>Example: Remove Grand Total from Excel Pivot Table</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the points scored by basketball players on various teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/countunique1.jpg"495">
Now suppose we insert the following pivot table to summarize the <b>sum</b> of points by team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removetotal1.jpg"506">
By default, Excel creates a <b>Grand Total</b> row that shows the grand total of the points values.
To remove this Grand Total row, first click on any cell in the pivot table.
Then, click the <b>Design</b> tab along the top ribbon and then click the dropdown button titled <b>Grand Totals</b>, then click <b>Off for Rows and Columns</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removetotal2.jpg">
The <b>Grand Total</b> row will be removed from the pivot table:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/removetotal3.jpg"527">
Note that within the <b>Grand Totals</b> dropdown menu, you can also choose to display the grand total only for the rows or columns if you’d like.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Remove Specific Text from Cells</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formulas to remove specific text from cells in Excel:
<b>Method 1: Remove One Specific Text</b>
<b>=SUBSTITUTE(A1,"text1","")
</b>
This particular formula removes “text1” from cell <b>A1</b>.
<b>Method 2: Remove Multiple Specific Texts</b>
<b>=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1,"text1",""),"text2",""),"text3","")
</b>
This particular formula removes “text1, “text2”, and “text3” from cell <b>A1</b>.
The following examples show how to use each method in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Remove One Specific Text</h3>
Suppose we have the following column in Excel that shows the position for 15 different basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/subst1.jpg"424">
We can use the following formula to remove “r” from every position name:
<b>=SUBSTITUTE(A2,"r","")</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>B2</b> and then copy and paste it down to every remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/subst2.jpg">
Notice that the “r” has been removed from every position name.
<h3>Example 2: Remove Multiple Specific Texts</h3>
Suppose we have the following column in Excel that shows the username for 10 different people on some website:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/subst3.jpg"414">
Suppose we want to remove the following specific text from each username:
dashes (<b>–</b>)
exclamation points (<b>!</b>)
the number 5 (<b>5</b>)
We can use the following formula to do so:
<b>=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A2,"-",""),"!",""),"5","")
</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>B2</b> and then copy and paste it down to every remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/subst4.jpg"476">
Notice that any “-“, “!”, and “5” has been removed from every username.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Replace Blank Cells with Zero in Excel</span></h2>
The easiest way to replace blank cells with zeros in Excel is to use the <b>Go To Special</b> function.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Replace Blank Cells with Zero in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the points scored by various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/replaceblank1-1.jpg"466">
Suppose we would like to replace the blank cells in the Points column with zeros.
To do so, type <b>Ctrl+G</b> to bring up the <b>Go To</b> window:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/replaceblank2.jpg"478">
Then click the <b>Special</b> button in the bottom left corner of the <b>Go To</b> window.
In the new window that appears, select <b>Blanks</b> and then click <b>OK</b>:

Lastly, type in the value <b>0</b> in the formula bar and press <b>Ctrl+Enter</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/replaceblank5.jpg"462">
Each of the blank cells in the Points column will automatically be replaced with zeros.
<b>Note</b>: It’s important that you press <b>Ctrl+Enter</b> after typing the zero so that every blank cell will be filled in with a zero instead of just the first blank cell selected.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Replace #N/A Values in Excel (With Examples)</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to replace #N/A values in Excel with either zeros or blanks:
<b>#replace #N/A with zero
=IFERROR(FORMULA, "0")
#replace #N/A with blank
=IFERROR(FORMULA, "") 
</b>
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice to replace #N/A values from a VLOOKUP with zero or blanks.
<b>Related:</b>  How to Replace Blank Cells with Zero in Excel 
<h3>Example: Replace #N/A Values in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/replace_na1.png">
And suppose we use the <b>VLOOKUP()</b> function to look up points based on team name:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/replace_na2.png">
Notice that some of the values returned in the VLOOKUP() are #N/A values.
We can turn these values into zeros by using the <b>IFERROR()</b> function as follows:
<b>#replace #N/A with zero
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, $A$1:$B$11, 2, FALSE), "0")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this function in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/replace_na3.png">
Alternatively, we can turn the #N/A values into blanks using the <b>IFERROR()</b> function as follows:
<b>#replace #N/A with blank
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, $A$1:$B$11, 2, FALSE), "")</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this function in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/replace_na4.png">
Notice that each value that was previously #N/A is now blank.
Using the <b>IFERROR()</b> function, we can replace #N/A values with any value that we’d like.
In the previous examples, we simply chose to replace #N/A values with zeros or blanks because these are the most common replacement values used in practice.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: Return Multiple Values Based on Single Criteria</span></h2>
You can use the following basic formula to return multiple values in Excel based on a single criteria:
<b>=INDEX($A$1:$A$14, SMALL(IF(E$1=$B$1:$B$14, MATCH(ROW($B$1:$B$14), ROW($B$1:$B$14)), ""), ROWS($A$1:A1)))
</b>
This particular formula returns all of the values in the range <b>A1:A14</b> where the corresponding value in the range <b>B1:B14</b> is equal to the value in cell <b>E1</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Return Multiple Values Based on Single Criteria in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the winner of the NBA finals during various years:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/multiple1.jpg"499">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b> to return every year that the Warriors were the winners:
<b>=INDEX($A$1:$A$14, SMALL(IF(E$1=$B$1:$B$14, MATCH(ROW($B$1:$B$14), ROW($B$1:$B$14)), ""), ROWS($A$1:A1)))</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, the first year that the Warriors won will be shown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/multiple2.jpg"570">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Rotate Axis Labels in Excel (With Example)</span></h2>
You can easily rotate the axis labels on a chart in Excel by modifying the <b>Text direction</b> value within the <b>Format Axis</b> panel.
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so in practice.
<h2>Step 1: Enter the  Data</h2>
First, let’s enter the following dataset into Excel:
<h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/time1.jpg"430">
<b>Step 2: Create the Plot</b>
</h2>
Next, highlight the values in the range <b>A2:B20</b>.
Then click the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click the icon called <b>Scatter with Smooth Lines and Markers</b> within the <b>Charts</b> group.
The following chart will automatically appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rotate1.jpg"516">
By default, Excel makes each label on the x-axis horizontal.
However, this causes the labels to overlap in some areas and makes it difficult to read.
<h2>Step 3: Rotate Axis Labels</h2>
In this step, we will rotate the axis labels to make them easier to read.
To do so, double click any of the values on the x-axis.
In the <b>Format Axis</b> panel that appears, click the icon called <b>Size & Properties</b> and type <b>-45</b> in the box titled <b>Custom angle</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/time5.jpg"314">
The x-axis labels will be rotated at a 45 degree angle to make them easier to read:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rotate2.jpg"504">
Notice that the labels are much easier to read now.
Feel free to play around with the value in the <b>Custom angle</b> box to rotate the labels exactly how you’d like.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Create a Scatterplot with Multiple Series in Excel</span></h2>
Often you may want to create a scatterplot with multiple series in Excel, similar to the plot below:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scatterMult6.png">
Fortunately this is fairly easy to do in Excel with some simple formulas. The following step-by-step example shows exactly how to do so.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the following (X, Y) values for four different groups: A, B, C, and D.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scatterMult1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Format the Data</h3>
Before we can create a scatterplot to visualize the (X, Y) coordinates for each group, we must first format the data in a specific manner. 
First, we’ll enter the unique values for each group along the top row and then type the following formula into cell E2:
<b>=IF($A2=H$1, $C2, NA())
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scatterMult2.png">
We’ll then drag this formula to every cell to the right of cell E2. We’ll then drag it to every cell below H2 until we end up with the following result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scatterMult3.png">
<h3>Step 3: Create the Scatterplot</h3>
Next, highlight every value in column <b>B</b>. Then, hold <b>Ctrl</b> and highlight every cell in the range<b> E1:H17</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scatterMult4.png">
Along the top ribbon, click the <b>Insert</b> tab and then click <b>Insert Scatter (X, Y)</b> within the <b>Charts</b> group to produce the following scatterplot:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scatterMult5.png">
The (X, Y) coordinates for each group are shown, with each group possessing a unique color.
Feel free to modify the colors, point sizes, and labels to make the plot more aesthetically pleasing:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: Use SEARCH Function to Search Multiple Values</span></h2>
The <b>SEARCH</b> function in Excel can be used to find the location of one text string within another.
However, sometimes you may wish to use the <b>SEARCH</b> function to search for the existence of one of several text strings within another.
You can use the following formula to do so:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH({"string1","string2","string3"},A2)))>0</b>
This particular formula searches for “string1”, “string2”, and “string3” within the string in cell <b>A2</b>.
If any of these strings are found, the formula returns <b>TRUE</b>.
Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Use SEARCH Function to Search Multiple Values in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of basketball team names in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mid1.jpg"534">
Now suppose we would like to determine if the team name “Pacers”, “Raptors”, or “Nuggets” exists in each row.
We can use the following formula to do so:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH({"Pacers","Raptors","Nuggets"},A2)))>0</b>
We can type this formula into cell B2 and then click and drag this formula down to each remaining cell in column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/search1.jpg"599">
Column B displays <b>TRUE</b> if the team name contains one of the three strings we specified.
Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>.
If you would instead like to return <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> instead of <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b>, you can use the following formula:
<b>=IF(SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH({"Pacers","Raptors","Nuggets"},A2)))>0,1,0)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/search2.jpg"563">
Column B displays <b>1 </b>if the team name contains one of the three strings we specified.
Otherwise, it returns <b>0</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform a Standard Deviation IF Calculation in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following formulas to perform a standard deviation IF calculation in Excel:
<b>Method 1: Standard Deviation IF (One Criteria)</b>
<b>=STDEV(IF(A:A="Value",C:C))
</b>
This formula calculates the standard deviation of values in column <b>C</b> where the values in column <b>A</b> are equal to “Value.”
<b>Method 2: Standard Deviation IF (Multiple Criteria)</b>
<b>=STDEV(IF((A:A="Value1")*(B:B="Value2"),C:C,""))
</b>
This formula calculates the standard deviation of values in column <b>C</b> where the values in column <b>A</b> are equal to “Value1” and the values in column <b>B</b> are equal to “Value2.”
The following examples show how to use each formula in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Calculate Standard Deviation IF (One Criteria)</h3>
We can use the following formula to calculate the standard deviation of the values in the <b>Points</b> column where the value in the <b>Team</b> column is equal to “Mavs”:
<b>=STDEV(IF(A:A="Mavs",C:C))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/stdevif1.jpg">
The standard deviation of <b>Points</b> for the rows where <b>Team</b> is equal to “Mavs” is <b>7.3326</b>.
<h3>Example 2: Calculate Standard Deviation IF (Multiple Criteria)</h3>
We can use the following formula to calculate the standard deviation of the values in the <b>Points</b> column where the value in the <b>Team</b> column is equal to “Mavs” and the value in the <b>Position</b> column is equal to “Guard”:
<b>=STDEV(IF((A:A="Mavs")*(B:B="Guard"),C:C,""))</b>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/subtotalcountif4.jpg"454">
If we attempt to use the <b>AVERAGEIF()</b> function to calculate the average of the values in the Points column where the value in the Position column is equal to “Guard”, it will actually return the average of points for the rows equal to “Guard” in the original dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/subtotalavg1.jpg"525">
Instead, we need to use the following formula:
<b>=AVERAGE(IF(SUBTOTAL(2,OFFSET(C2,ROW(C2:C11)-ROW(C2),0)),IF(B2:B11="Guard",C2:C11)))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/subtotalavg2.jpg"464">
This formula returns the correct average of <b>21.25</b>.
We can confirm this is correct by manually calculating the average of the points values for the rows where the Position column is equal to “Guard”:

<h2><span class="orange">How to Sum Values by Category in Excel</span></h2>
Often you may want to sum the values of some dataset in Excel based on a category or group.
For example, suppose we have the following dataset and we’d like to sum the total “points” by team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumcat11.jpg"474">
The following step-by-step example shows how to do so.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, enter the data values into Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumcat11.jpg"474">
<h3>Step 2: Find the Unique Categories</h3>
Next, we need to use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> function to produce a list of unique values in a certain range.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>E2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(B2:B12)
</b>
This will produce a list of unique teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumcat12.jpg"485">
<h3>Step 3: Find the Sum by Category</h3>
Next, we will use the <b>SUMIF(range, criterion, sum_range)</b> function to find the sum of the points scored by each team.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>F3</b>:
<b>=SUMIF($B$2:$C$12, E3, $C$2:$C$12)
</b>
This will calculate the sum of points scored by each team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumcat13.jpg"550">
This tells us:
The total points scored by players on the Lakers is <b>21.6</b>.
The total points scored by players on the Mavericks is <b>56.4</b>.
The total points scored by players on the Spurs is <b>48.8</b>.
The total points scored by players on the Warriors is <b>65</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Sum by Date in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate the sum of values by date in an Excel spreadsheet:
<b>=SUMIF(A1:A10, C1, B1:B10)
</b>
This particular formula calculates the sum of values in the cell range <b>B1:B10</b> only where the corresponding cells in the range <b>A1:A10</b> are equal to the date in cell <b>C1</b>.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Calculate Sum by Date in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the sales of some product on various dates:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/averagedate1.jpg"496">
Now suppose we’d like to calculate the sum of sales by date.
To generate a list of unique dates, we can use the following formula:
<b>=SORT(UNIQUE(A2:A15))</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>D2</b>:

<h3>Step 2: Extract the Month from Dates</h3>
Next, we need to use the <b>=MONTH()</b> function to extract the month from each date.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>D2</b>:
<b>=MONTH(A2)
</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to every remaining cell in column D:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_sumbymonth2.jpg"478">
<h3>Step 3: Find the Unique Months</h3>
Next, we need to use the <b>=UNIQUE()</b> function to produce a list of unique months.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>F2</b>:
<b>=UNIQUE(D2:D10)
</b>
This will produce a list of unique months:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_sumbymonth3.jpg"512">
<h3>Step 4: Find the Sum by Month</h3>
Next, we will use the <b>SUMIF(range, criterion, sum_range)</b> function to find the sum of the sales made during each month.
In our example, we’ll type the following formula in cell <b>G2</b>:
<b>=SUMIF($D$2:$D$10, F2, $B$2:$B$10)
</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to the remaining cells in column G:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/excel_sumbymonth4.jpg">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sumquarter2.jpg"482">
<h2>Step 3: Calculate the Sum by Quarter</h2>
Next, we’ll type the following formula into cell <b>E2</b> to calculate the sum of sales for the first quarter:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT((ROUNDUP(MONTH($A$2:$A$14)/3,0)=D2)*$B$2:$B$14)
</b>
We’ll then drag and fill this formula down to the remaining cells in column E:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sumquarter3.jpg">
From the output we can see:
There were <b>71 </b>total sales made in the first quarter.
There were <b>38 </b>total sales made in the second quarter.
There were <b>130 </b>total sales made in the third quarter.
There were <b>66 </b>total sales made in the fourth quarter.
We can verify these values are correct by manually calculating the sum of sales for a given quarter.
For example, the total sales in the first quarter (January, February, March) can be calculated as:
First Quarter Sales: 30 + 12 + 15 + 14 = <b>71</b>
This matches the value calculated by our formula.

You can use the following basic formula to sum cells in Excel that contain both numbers and text:
<b>=SUM(SUBSTITUTE(B2:B8, "some_text", "")+0)
</b>
This particular formula removes the text string “some_text” from each cell in the range <b>B2:B8</b> and then calculates the sum of the values in the range <b>B2:B8</b>.
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example 1: Calculate Sum of Cells with Text and Numbers</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the total number of sales at seven different stores:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sumtext1.jpg"464">
To calculate the sum of sales, we can type the following formula into cell <b>B10</b>:

You can use the following basic formula to sum every nth row in Excel:
<b>=SUM(A1:A20*(MOD(ROW(A1:A20),4)=0))
</b>
This particular formula calculates the sum of every <b>4th</b> row in the range <b>A1:A20</b>.
Simply change the value in the <b>ROW()</b> function to sum a different interval of rows.
For example, you can use the following formula to sum every <b>3rd</b> row:
<b>=SUM(A1:A20*(MOD(ROW(A1:A20),3)=0)) </b>
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Sum Every Nth Row in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following list of values in Excel:

Sum of Every 4th Row: 10 + 19 + 8 + 24 + 5 = <b>66</b>.
If you’d like to sum the value of every nth row starting with the <em>first</em> row, you can subtract 1 within the <b>ROW()</b> function of the formula:
<b>=SUM(A1:A20*(MOD(ROW(A1:A20)-1,4)=0))</b>

<h2><span class="orange">How to Sum Filtered Rows in Excel (With Example)</span></h2>
The easiest way to take the sum of a filtered range in Excel is to use the following syntax:
<b>SUBTOTAL(109, A1:A10)
</b>
Note that the value 109 is a  shortcut  for taking the sum of a filtered range of rows.
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Sum Filtered Rows in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset that contains information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/subtotal1.jpg"433">
Next, let’s filter the data to only show the players on the Mavs or the Warriors.
To do so, highlight the cell range <b>A1:B10</b>. Then click the <b>Data </b>tab along the top ribbon and click the <b>Filter</b> button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/subtotal2.jpg"617">
Then click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Team</b> and then uncheck the box next to Celtics, then click <b>OK</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/subtotal3.jpg"493">
The data will automatically be filtered to remove rows with “Celtics” as the team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/subtotal4.jpg"444">
If we attempt to use the <b>SUM()</b> function to sum the points column of the filtered rows, it will actually return the sum of all of the original values:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/subtotal5.jpg"439">
Instead, we can use the <b>SUBTOTAL()</b> function:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/subtotal6.jpg">
This function takes the sum of only the visible rows.
We can manually verify this by taking the sum of the visible rows:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use SUMIF From Another Sheet</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to use a <b>SUMIF </b>from another sheet in Excel:
<b>=SUMIF(Sheet1!B2:B11, ">10")
</b>
This particular formula takes the sum of values in the range <b>B2:B11</b> on the sheet titled <b>Sheet1</b> only if the values are greater than 10.
The following examples show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example 1: SUMIF From Another Sheet</h2>
Suppose we have the following sheet named <b>Sheet1</b> in Excel that contains some data about basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sumif11.jpg"475">
Now suppose we’d like to switch to <b>Sheet2</b> and take the sum of the points for the players who have more than 10 points.
We can use the following syntax to do so:

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use SUMIF with ISNUMBER</span></h2>
Often you may want to sum the values in a range in Excel only if the value in a corresponding range is a number.
You can use the following formula to do so:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(A:A),B:B)
</b>
This particular formula sums the values in column B only where the corresponding value in column A is a number.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Use SUMIF with ISNUMBER in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of sales made by employees at a company with certain ID’s:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/isnumber1.jpg"468">
Notice that some of the ID values are characters while others are numerical values.
We can use the following formula to calculate the sum of sales only for the rows where the ID value is numeric:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(A2:A11),B2:B11)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/isnumber2.jpg"545">
The sum of sales for only the rows where the ID is numeric is <b>67</b>.
We can manually verify that this is correct by calculating the sum of sales for only the rows where the ID is numeric:

This matches the value that we calculated using the formula.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use SUMIF with Multiple Ranges</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to perform a SUMIF function with multiple ranges in Excel:
<b>=SUMIF(A2:A11,G2,B2:B11) + SUMIF(A2:A11,G2,C2:C11)
</b>
This particular formula adds the values in the ranges <b>B2:B11</b> and <b>C2:C11</b> where the corresponding values in the range <b>A2:A11</b> are equal to <b>G2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Using SUMIF with Multiple Ranges in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the number of points scored by various basketball players during two different games:

Now suppose we would like to calculate the total sum of all points scored between both games for only the players on the <b>Mavs</b> team.
We can use the following formula to do so: 
<b>=SUMIF(A2:A11,E2,B2:B11) + SUMIF(A2:A11,E2,C2:C11)</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell <b>F2</b> and then press <b>Enter</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sumif2.jpg"645">
We can see that the total sum of all points scored between both games for the players on the <b>Mavs</b> team was <b>140</b>.
We can verify this is correct by manually taking the sum of all points values for the Mavs players between the two games:
Total Points: 22 + 20 + 15 + 32 + 12 + 14 + 10 + 15 = <b>140</b>.
This matches the value that we calculated using our formula.
<b>Note</b>: In this example, we used the <b>SUMIF()</b> function with two cell ranges, but we can use similar syntax to include any number of cell ranges that we’d like.

<h2><span class="orange">SUMIF vs. SUMIFS in Excel: What’s the Difference?</span></h2>
In Excel, the <b>SUMIF</b> and <b>SUMIFS </b>functions both sum the cells in a range that meet a certain condition, but they use slightly different behaviors:
The <b>SUMIF </b>function sums the number of cells in a range that meet <b>one condition</b>.
The <b>SUMIFS </b>function counts the number of cells in a range that meet <b>several conditions</b>.
The following examples show how to use each function in practice with the following data in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sumif_vs1.jpg"472">
<h3>Example 1: Using SUMIF</h3>
We can use the following <b>SUMIF </b>formula to sum the values in the Points column where the value in the Team column is equal to “Mavs”:
<b>=SUMIF(A2:A16, "Mavs", C2:C16)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:

<h3>Example 2: Using SUMIFS</h3>
We can use the following <b>SUMIFS</b> formula to sum the values in the Points column where the value in the Team column is equal to “Mavs” and the value in the Rebounds column is greater than 5:
<b>=SUMIFS(C2:C16, A2:A16, "Mavs", B2:B16, ">5")
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sumif_vs3.jpg"612">
The sum of points for the rows where team is equal to “Mavs” and rebounds is greater than 5 is <b>51</b>.
<b>Note</b>: Refer to the Excel documentation page for a complete explanation of the  SUMIF  and  SUMIFS  functions.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Use SUMIFS with a Date Range in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following syntax to calculate the sum of values in Excel where corresponding cells fall in a certain date range:
<b>=SUMIFS(B2:B11, A2:A11, ">="&D2, A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)
</b>
This formula calculates the sum of the values in the range <b>B2:B11</b> where the date in the range <b>A2:A11</b> is between the dates in cells <b>D2</b> and <b>E2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: Use SUMIFS with Date Range in Excel</h3>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the number of sales made by some company on various days:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rangeexcel1.jpg"445">
We can define a start and end date in cells <b>D2</b> and <b>E2</b> respectively, then use the following formula to calculate the sum of the sales where the dates fall between the start and end date:
<b>=SUMIFS(B2:B11, A2:A11, ">="&D2, A2:A11,"&lt;="&E2)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sumifdate2.jpg">
We can see that a total of <b>73 </b>sales were made between 1/10/2022 and 1/15/2022.
We can manually verify this by taking the sum of the sales between these dates:
1/12/2022: 28
1/14/2022: 30
1/15/2022: 15
Sum of sales = 28 + 30 + 15 = <b>73</b>.
If we change either the start or end date, the formula will automatically update to calculate the sum of the cells within the new date range.
For example, suppose we change the start date to 1/1/2022:

<h2><span class="orange">How to Create a Summary Table in Excel (With Example)</span></h2>
Often you may want to create a summary table in Excel to summarize the values in some dataset.
Fortunately this is easy to do using built-in functions in Excel.
The following step-by-step example shows how to create a summary table in Excel in practice.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Original Data</h3>
First, we’ll enter the following dataset that contains information about product sales for some company:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/summarytableexcel1.jpg"463">
<h3>Step 2: Find Unique Values</h3>
Next, we’ll use the following formula to identify the unique product names in column B:
<b>=UNIQUE(B2:B13)
</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>F2</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/summarytableexcel2.jpg"550">
We can see that this formula is able to extract the three unique product names from column B.
<h3>Step 3: Calculate Summary Statistics for Each Variable</h3>
Next, we can calculate the total units sold, average number of units sold, and total revenue for each product by using the following formulas:
<b>Total Units Sold:</b>
<b>=SUMIF($B$2:$B$13, F2, $C$2:$C$13)</b>
<b>Average Number of Units Sold:</b>
<b>=AVERAGEIF($B$2:$B$13, F2, $C$2:$C$13)</b>
<b>Total Revenue:</b>
<b>=SUMIF($B$2:$B$13, F2, $D$2:$D$13)</b>
We can type these formulas into cells <b>G2</b>, <b>H2</b>, and <b>I2</b>, respectively:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/summarytableexcel3.jpg"674">
We now have a summary table that tells us the total units sold, average units sold, and total revenue for each of the three products from our original dataset.
<h3>Step 4: Format the Summary Table (Optional)</h3>
Lastly, feel free to add a border around each cell in the summary table and add background colors to make the summary table more aesthetically pleasing:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/summarytableexcel4.jpg">
The summary table is even easier to read now.
<b>Note</b>: We chose to calculate mean values and sum values in our summary table, but feel free to calculate other values of interest such as the minimum, maximum, median, range, and other metrics.
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use SUMPRODUCT Across Multiple Sheets</span></h2>
The <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> function in Excel returns the sum of the products of two arrays.
You can use the following basic syntax to use the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> function across multiple sheets:
<b>=SUM(SUMPRODUCT(Sheet1!A2:A11, Sheet1!B2:B11),
     SUMPRODUCT(Sheet2!A2:A6, Sheet2!B2:B6),
     SUMPRODUCT(Sheet3!A2:A9, Sheet3!B2:B9))
</b>
This formula performs a <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> calculation across specific ranges in the sheets named <b>Sheet1</b>, <b>Sheet2</b>, and <b>Sheet3</b> and then takes the sum of the three values.
The following example show how to use this syntax in practice.
<h3>Example: How to Use SUMPRODUCT Across Multiple Sheets</h3>
Suppose we have the following three sheets in an Excel workbook:
<b>Sheet1:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sumprod11.jpg"437">
<b>Sheet2:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sumprod12.jpg"437">
<b>Sheet3:</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sumprod13.jpg"439">
We can use the following formula to calculate the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> between columns A and B in each sheet individually and then add the sum of all three values:
<b>=SUM(SUMPRODUCT(Sheet1!A2:A11, Sheet1!B2:B11),
     SUMPRODUCT(Sheet2!A2:A6, Sheet2!B2:B6),
     SUMPRODUCT(Sheet3!A2:A9, Sheet3!B2:B9))</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sumprod14.jpg">
The value for the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> across all three sheets turns out to be <b>355</b>.
If you use the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> in each sheet individually, you’ll end up with the following values:
<b>Sheet1</b> SUMPRODUCT of A and B columns: 184
<b>Sheet2</b> SUMPRODUCT of A and B columns: 25
<b>Sheet3</b> SUMPRODUCT of A and B columns: 146
The sum of these three values is: 184 + 25 + 146 = <b>355</b>.
This matches the value that we calculated using one formula.
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> function in Excel  here .
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: Using SUMPRODUCT Only with Values Greater Than Zero</span></h2>
The <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> function in Excel returns the sum of the products of two corresponding arrays.
To use this function only with values that are greater than zero, you can use the following formula:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--(A1:A9>0),A1:A9,B1:B9)
</b>
This particular formula will only return the sum of the products of the two arrays for the values that are greater than zero in the range <b>A1:A9</b>.
The following example show how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example: Use SUMPRODUCT Only With Values Greater than Zero</h3>
Suppose we have the following two arrays of values in Excel:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumprod1.jpg"544">
If we use the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> function as usual, we can take the sum of the products between the values in column A and column B:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumprod2.jpg"571">
The sum of the products turns out to be <b>144</b>.
We can manually verify that this is correct:
Sum of Products = 10*3 + 5*4 + 0*5 + (-3)*2 + 6*5 + 4*5 + 10*2 + (-5)*4 + 10*5 = <b>144</b>.
To only take the sum of the products where the value in column A is greater than zero, we can use the following formula:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--(A1:A9>0),A1:A9,B1:B9)</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sumprod3.jpg">
The sum of the products where the value in column A is greater than zero turns out to be <b>170</b>.
We can manually verify that this is correct:
Sum of Products = 10*3 + 5*4 + 6*5 + 4*5 + 10*2 + 10*5 = <b>170</b>.
<b>Note</b>: You can find the complete documentation for the <b>SUMPRODUCT</b> function  here .
<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Find Top 10 Values Based on Criteria</span></h2>

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Find Duplicates Using VLOOKUP</span></h2>
You can use the following VLOOKUP formula in Excel to find values in one column that are duplicates of values in another column:
<b>=VLOOKUP(B2, $A$2:$A$8, 1, FALSE)
</b>
This particular formula looks up the value in cell <b>B2 </b>in the range <b>A2:A8</b> and returns <b>B2</b> if it is found. Otherwise, #N/A is returned.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: Find Duplicates Using VLOOKUP in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows the names of various fruits sold by a store during two consecutive weeks:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/vlookupdup1.jpg"503">
Now suppose we would like to use a <b>VLOOKUP</b> function to find the names of the fruits in the <b>Week 2</b> column that are duplicates of a name in the <b>Week 1</b> column.
To do so, we can type the following formula into cell C2:
<b>=VLOOKUP(B2, $A$2:$A$8, 1, FALSE)</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to the remaining cells in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/vlookupdup2.jpg"565">
If the name of the fruit appears in column C, then it is a duplicate.
For example:
Pears is a duplicate.
Peaches is not a duplicate.
Kiwis is a duplicate.
Bananas is a duplicate.
And so on.
Note that we could also use the following VLOOKUP formula to return specific values that indicate whether or not each fruit is a duplicate:
<b>=IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(B2,$A$2:$A$8,1,FALSE)),"Not a Duplicate","Duplicate")</b>
We’ll type this formula into cell C2 and then drag and fill it down to each remaining cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/vlookupdup3.jpg"512">
From the output we can see:
Pears is a duplicate.
Peaches is not a duplicate.
Kiwis is a duplicate.
Bananas is a duplicate.
And so on.

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use VLOOKUP From Another Workbook</span></h2>
You can use the following basic syntax to perform a VLOOKUP from another workbook in Excel:
<b>=VLOOKUP(A2,'[data2.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$1:$B$11,2,0)
</b>
This particular formula will look up the value in cell <b>A2</b> of the current workbook in the range <b>A1:B11</b> of a second workbook called<b> data2.xlsx</b> and return the corresponding value in the second column.
<b>Note</b>: For this formula to work, both workbooks should be saved in the same directory.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Step 1: Enter Data into Both Workbooks</h2>
Suppose we have the following workbook called <b>data.1.xlsx</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/another1.jpg"457">
And suppose we have another workbook called <b>data2.xlsx</b>:

Both workbooks are saved in the same directory.
<h2>Step 2: Perform VLOOKUP Between Workbooks</h2>
Now suppose we would like to use a VLOOKUP in the first workbook to look up the team names in the second workbook and return the corresponding value in the Assists column.
To do so, we can type the following formula into cell C2 of the first workbook:
<b>=VLOOKUP(A2,'[data2.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$1:$B$11,2,0)</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, the value in the Assists column from the second workbook that corresponds to the “Mavs” team will be shown:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/another3.jpg"625">
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C to find the Assists values for each team:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/another4.jpg"450">
The values in the Assists column of the second workbook have now all been pulled into the first workbook.

</b>
This particular formula will look for the cell in the range <b>A2:B8</b> that contains the word in cell <b>A11</b> and return the corresponding value in the second column.
The following example shows how to use this formula in practice.
<h2>Example: VLOOKUP if Cell Contains Word within Text</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the total sales made at various stores:

The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/contains2.jpg"548">
This VLOOKUP formula is able to look up “Axel” in the list of store names and return the correct sales value of <b>30</b>.
Note that this formula is also case-insensitive.
This means that if we use “axel” then the formula will still be able to find this text in the list of store names:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/contains3.jpg"573">

<h2><span class="orange">Excel: How to Use VLOOKUP to Return All Matches</span></h2>
By default, the <b>VLOOKUP</b> function in Excel looks up some value in a range and returns a corresponding value <em>only for the first match</em>.
However, you can use the following syntax to look up some value in a range and return corresponding values for <em>all matches</em>:
<b>=FILTER(C2:C11, E2=A2:A11)</b>
This particular formula looks in the range <b>C2:C11</b> and returns the corresponding values in the range <b>A2:A11</b> for <em>all rows</em> where the value in <b>C2:C11</b> is equal to <b>E2</b>.
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.
<h2>Example: Use VLOOKUP to Return All Matches</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset in Excel that shows information about various basketball teams:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rock1.jpg"470">
Suppose we use the following formula with <b>VLOOKUP</b> to look up the team “Rockets” in column A and return the corresponding points value in column C:
<b>=VLOOKUP(E2, A2:C11, 3)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rock2.jpg"466">
The <b>VLOOKUP</b> function returns the value in the “Points” column for the first occurrence of Rockets in the “Team” column, but it fails to return the points values for the other two rows that also contain Rockets in the “Team” column.
To return the points values for all rows that contain Rockets in the “Team” column, we can use the <b>FILTER</b> function instead.
Here’s the exact formula we can use:
<b>=FILTER(C2:C11, E2=A2:A11)
</b>
The following screenshot shows how to use this formula in practice:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rock3.jpg"486">

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Year Over Year Growth in Excel</span></h2>
You can use the following formula to calculate year over year (YoY) growth for some company:
<b>YoY Growth = (Current Period Revenue / Previous Period Revenue) - 1</b>
For example, suppose a company earns $8 million in revenue this year and earned $5 million in revenue last year.
We would calculate their year over year growth to be 60%:
<b>Year over Year Growth = ($8 million / $5 million) - 1 = 0.60</b>
The following example shows how to use this formula to calculate year over year growth for a company in Excel.
<h2>Example: Calculate Year Over Year Growth in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the total revenue for some company during 10 consecutive years:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/yoy1.jpg"450">
We can type the following formula into cell <b>C3</b> to calculate the year over year growth between 2012 and 2013:
<b>=(B3/B2)-1</b>
Once we press <b>Enter</b>, the year over year growth will be displayed as a decimal:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/yoy2.jpg">
We can see that the year over year growth from 2012 to 2013 is 5%, which was calculated as:
<b>Year over Year Growth = ($315,000 / $300,000) - 1 = 0.05</b>
We can then drag and fill this formula down to each remaining cell in column C to calculate the year over year growth each year:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/yoy3.jpg"500">
To format the growth values as percentages, simply highlight the cell range <b>C3:C11</b>, then click the <b>Number Format</b> dropdown menu from the <b>Home</b> tab and choose <b>Percentage</b>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/comp3.jpg"417">
The year over year growth values will automatically be formatted as percentages:

Notice that whenever revenue is down in a given year, the year over year growth percentage is negative.
For example, consider the years 2019 and 2020.
Here is how the year over year growth was calculated for 2020:
<b>Year over Year Growth = ($800,000 / $880,000) - 1 = -0.0909</b>
The year over year growth is -9.09% since revenue decreased from the current year compared to the previous year.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Expected Frequency</span></h2>
An <b>expected frequency </b>is a theoretical frequency that we <em>expect </em>to occur in an experiment.
This type of frequency occurs most often in two types of Chi-Square tests:
 Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test 
 Chi-Square Test of Independence 
This tutorial explains how to calculate expected frequencies for each of these two tests.
<h3>Expected Frequency in a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test</h3>
A <b>Chi-Square goodness of fit test</b> is used to determine whether or not a categorical variable follows a hypothesized distribution. With this type of test, we compare the observed frequencies of a categorical variable with the expected frequencies.
For example, suppose a shop owner claims that an equal number of customers come into his shop each weekday. To test this hypothesis, an independent researcher records the number of customers that come into the shop on a given week and finds the following:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/expectedFreq1.png">
To calculate the <em>expected frequency </em>of customers each day, we can use the following formula:
<b>Expected frequency = Expected percentage * Total count</b>
For this particular example, the shop owner expects an equal amount of customers to come into the shop each day, thus the expected percentage of customers that come in on a given day is 20% of the total customers for the week.
This means we can calculate the expected frequency of customers each day as:
Expected frequency = 20% * 250 total customers = <b>50</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/expectedFreq.png">
<h3>Expected Frequency in a Chi-Square Goodness Test of Independence</h3>
A <b>Chi-Square Test of Independence</b> is used to determine whether or not there is a significant association between two categorical variables. With this type of test, we also compare a set of observed frequencies with a set of expected frequencies.
For example, suppose we want to know whether or not gender is associated with political party preference. We take a simple random sample of 500 voters and survey them on their political party preference. The following table shows the results of the survey:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/expectedFreq2.png">
To calculate the <em>expected frequency </em>of each cell in the table, we can use the following formula:
<b>Expected frequency = (row sum * column sum) / table sum</b>
For example, the expected value for Male Republicans is: (230*250) / 500 = <b>115</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/expectedFreq3.png">
We can repeat this formula to obtain the expected value for each cell in the table:

To find the <b>expected value</b> of a probability distribution, we can use the following formula:
μ = Σx * P(x)
where:
x: Data value
P(x): Probability of value
For example, the expected number of goals for the soccer team would be calculated as:
μ = 0*0.18  +  1*0.34  +  2*0.35  +  3*0.11  +  4*0.02  =  <b>1.45</b> goals.
The following example provides a step-by-step example of how to calculate the expected value of a probability distribution in Excel.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the data values and corresponding probabilities for a given probability distribution:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/expected1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Multiply Values and Probabilities</h3>
Next, we’ll multiply the first number in the ‘Values’ column with the first number in the ‘Probability’ column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/expected2.png">
We’ll then copy and paste this formula down to every cell in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/expected3.png">
<h3>Step 3: Calculate Expected Value</h3>
Lastly, we can calculate the expected value of the probability distribution by using <b>SUM(C2:C10)</b> to sum all of the values in column C:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/expected4.png">
The expected value for this probability distribution is <b>3.3</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Expected Value in Python (With Examples)</span></h2>
A probability distribution tells us the probability that a  random variable  takes on certain values.
For example, the following probability distribution tells us the probability that a certain soccer team scores a certain number of goals in a given game:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/meanDist1.png">
To find the <b>expected value</b> of a probability distribution, we can use the following formula:
μ = Σx * P(x)
where:
x: Data value
P(x): Probability of value
For example, the expected number of goals for the soccer team would be calculated as:
μ = 0*0.18  +  1*0.34  +  2*0.35  +  3*0.11  +  4*0.02  =  <b>1.45</b> goals.
To calculate expected value of a probability distribution in Python, we can define a simple function:
<b>import numpy as np
def expected_value(values, weights):
    values = np.asarray(values)
    weights = np.asarray(weights)
    return (values * weights).sum() / weights.sum()
</b>
The following example shows how to use this function in practice.
<h3>Example: Calculating Expected Value in Python</h3>
The following code shows how to calculate the expected value of a probability distribution using the <b>expected_value()</b> function we defined earlier:
<b>#define values
values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#define probabilities
probs  = [.18, .34, .35, .11, .02]
#calculate expected value
expected_value(values, probs)
1.450000
</b>
The expected value is <b>1.45</b>. This matches the value that we calculated earlier by hand.
Note that this function will return an error if the length of the values array and the probabilities array are not equal.
For example:
<b>#define values
values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#define probabilities
probs  = [.18, .34, .35, .11, .02, .05, .11]
#attempt to calculate expected value
expected_value(values, probs)
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (5,) (7,) 
</b>
We receive an error because the length of the first array is <b>5</b> while the length of the second array is <b>7</b>.
In order for this expected value function to work, the length of both arrays must be equal.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Expected Value in R (With Examples)</span></h2>
A probability distribution tells us the probability that a  random variable  takes on certain values.
For example, the following probability distribution tells us the probability that a certain soccer team scores a certain number of goals in a given game:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/meanDist1.png">
To find the <b>expected value</b> of a probability distribution, we can use the following formula:

To calculate expected value of a probability distribution in R, we can use one of the following three methods:
<b>#method 1
sum(vals*probs)
#method 2
weighted.mean(vals, probs)
#method 3
c(vals %*% probs)
</b>
All three methods will return the same result.
The following examples show how to use each of these methods in R.
<h3>Example 1: Expected Value Using sum()</h3>
The following code shows how to calculate the expected value of a probability distribution using the <b>sum()</b> function:
<b>#define values
vals &lt;- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
#define probabilities
probs &lt;- c(.18, .34, .35, .11, .02)
#calculate expected value

[1] 1.45
</b>
<h3>
<b>Example 2: Expected Value Using weighted.mean()</b>
</h3>
The following code shows how to calculate the expected value of a probability distribution using the built-in <b>weighted.mean()</b> function in R:
<b>#define values

#define probabilities
probs &lt;- c(.18, .34, .35, .11, .02)

#define probabilities
probs &lt;- c(.18, .34, .35, .11, .02)
#calculate expected value
c(vals %*% probs)
[1] 1.45</b>
Notice that all three methods returned the same expected value.
<h2><span class="orange">5 Examples of Calculating Expected Value in Real Life</span></h2>
<b>Expected value</b> is a value that tells us the expected average that some  random variable  will take on in an infinite number of trials.
We use the following formula to calculate the expected value of some event:
<b>Expected Value</b> = Σx * P(x)
where:
<b>x</b>: Data value
<b>P(x)</b>: Probability of value
That formula might look a bit confusing, but it will make more sense when you see it used in the context of actual examples.
The following examples show how expected value is calculated in five different real-world situations.
<h3>Example 1: Investments</h3>
Expected value is often used by trading firms to determine the expected profit or loss from some investment.
For example, suppose a particular investment is could deliver a 5% annual return with a probability of 0.95, but it could also deliver a -20% annual return with a probability of 0.05.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/expect11.png">
We would calculate the expected value of this investment to be:
Expected value = 5%*.95 + (-20%)*.05 = <b>3.75%</b>
This particular investment has a positive expected value.
This means that if we invested in this particular investment an infinite number of times, we would expected a long-term average annual return of 3.75%.
<h3>Example 2: Weather</h3>
Expected value is often used by agricultural companies to determine the expected amount of rain that will fall during a given season.
For example, suppose a there is a 20% chance of 1 inch of rain, a 70% chance of 2 inches of rain, and a 10% chance of 3 inches of rain.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/expect12.png">
 
We would calculate the expected value for the amount of rain to be:
Expected value = 0.2*1 + 0.7*2 + 0.1*3 = <b>1.9 inches</b>
<h3>Example 3: Gambling</h3>
Expected value is often used by gamblers to determine how much they could potentially win at a certain game.
For example, suppose in a certain game there is a 5% chance of winning $100, a 50% chance of winning $0, and a 45% chance of losing $20.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/expect13.png">
We would calculate the expected value for winnings to be:
Expected value = 0.05*$100 + 0.5*$0 + 0.45*(-$20) = <b>-$4</b>
This means that if we played this game an infinite number of times we would expect to lose $4 each time we play, on average.
<h3>Example 4: Business</h3>
Expected value is often used by businesses to calculate the expected return on advertising spending.
For example, suppose for a particular advertisement there is a 10% chance of receiving a $5 return, a 30% chance of receiving a $2 return, and a %60 chance of receiving a -$8 return.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/expect14.png">
We would calculate the expected value for the advertisement to be:
Expected value = 0.1*$5 + 0.3*$2 + 0.6*(-$8) = <b>-$3.70</b>
This particular advertisement has a negative expected value.
This means that if the company used this particular advertisement an infinite number of times, it would expect to lose $3.70 each time, on average.
<h3>Example 5: Entrepreneurship</h3>
Expected value is often used by individuals when deciding whether or not they should pursue entrepreneurship.
For example, suppose an individuals thinks that if they quit their job and work for themselves that there is a 60% chance they could earn $20,000 in their first year, a 30% chance they could earn $60,000, and a 10% chance they would earn $0.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/expect15.png">
We would calculate the expected value for their income in the first year of entrepreneurship to be:
Expected value = 0.6*$20,000 + 0.3*$60,000 + 0.1*$0 = <b>$30,000</b>
Depending on whether or not this amount of money is sufficient, the individual could then choose to remain in their current job or quit.
<h2><span class="orange">TI-84: How to Find Expected Value of a Probability Distribution</span></h2>
A probability distribution tells us the probability that a  random variable  takes on certain values.
For example, the following probability distribution tells us the probability that a certain soccer team scores a certain number of goals in a given game:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/meanDist1.png">
To find the expected value of a probability distribution, we can use the following formula:
μ = Σx * P(x)
where:
x: Data value
P(x): Probability of value
For example, the expected number of goals for the soccer team would be calculated as:
μ = 0*0.18  +  1*0.34  +  2*0.35  +  3*0.11  +  4*0.02  =  <b>1.45</b> goals.
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate the expected value of a probability distribution on a TI-84 calculator.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, we will enter the data.
Press Stat, then press EDIT. Then enter the data values in column L1 and their probabilities in L2:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ex1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Multiply the Two Columns</h3>
Next, we will multiply columns L1 and L2.
Highlight the top of column L3 and type in the following formula: <b>L1 * L2</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ex2.png">
Use these steps to enter this formula:
Press Stat, then press 1.
Press the multiplication x button.
Press Stat, then press 2.
Once you press Enter, the following values will appear in column L3:

<h3>Step 3: Find the Expected Value</h3>
Lastly, use the following steps to find the expected value of the probability distribution:
Press 2nd and then press MODE to return to the home screen.
Press 2nd and then press STAT. Scroll over to “MATH” and then press 5.
Press 2nd and then press 3.
Press the ) button.
Once you press Enter, the expected value will be displayed:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ex4.png">
The expected value turns out to be <b>1.45</b>.
Notice that this matches the expected value that we calculated by hand at the beginning of the article.
<h2><span class="orange">Expected Value vs. Mean: What’s the Difference?</span></h2>
Two terms that are sometimes used interchangeably in statistics are <b>expected value</b> and <b>mean</b>.
In general, we use the following terms in different situations:
<b>Expected value</b> is used when we want to calculate the mean of a probability distribution. This represents the average value we expect to occur before collecting any data.
<b>Mean</b> is typically used when we want to calculate the average value of a given sample. This represents the average value of raw data that we’ve already collected.
The following examples illustrate how to calculate the expected value and the mean in practice.
<h3>Example: Calculating Expected Value</h3>
A probability distribution tells us the probability that a  random variable  takes on certain values.
For example, the following probability distribution tells us the probability that a certain soccer team scores a certain number of goals in a given game:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/meanDist1.png">
To calculate the expected value of this probability distribution, we can use the following formula:
Expected Value = Σx * P(x)
where:
<b>x</b>: Data value
<b>P(x)</b>: Probability of value
For example, we would calculate the expected value for this probability distribution to be:
Expected Value = 0*0.18  +  1*0.34  +  2*0.35  +  3*0.11  +  4*0.02  =  <b>1.45</b> goals.
This represents the expected number of goals that the team will score in any given game.
<h3>Example: Calculating Mean</h3>
We typically calculate the mean after we’ve actually collected raw data.
For example, suppose we record the number of goals that a soccer team scores in 15 different games:
Goals Scored: 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1
To calculate the mean number of goals scored per game, we can use the following formula:
Mean = Σx<sub>i</sub> / n
where:
<b>x<sub>i</sub></b>: Raw data values
<b>n</b>: Sample size
For example, we would calculate the mean number of goals scored as:
Mean = (1+1+0+2+2+1+0+3+1+1+1+2+4+3+1) / 15 = <b>1.533</b> goals.
This represents the mean number of goals scored per game by the team.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Calculate Expected Value of X^2</span></h2>
For a  random variable , denoted as X, you can use the following formula to calculate the expected value of X<sup>2</sup>:

where:

E(X<sup>2</sup>) = 11.08
The expected value of X<sup>2</sup> is <b>11.08</b>.
Note that this random variable is a <b>discrete random variable</b>, which means it can only take on a finite number of values.
If X is a <b>continuous random variable</b>, we must use the following formula to calculate the expected value of X<sup>2</sup>:

<b>f(x)</b>: The continuous  pdf  for the random variable X

<h2><span class="orange">What is Explained Variance? (Definition & Example)</span></h2>
<b>Explained variance</b> (sometimes called “explained variation”) refers to the variance in the response variable in a model that can be explained by the predictor variable(s) in the model.
The higher the explained variance of a model, the more the model is able to explain the variation in the data.
Explained variance appears in the output of two different statistical models:
<b>1. ANOVA:</b> Used to compare the means of three or more independent groups.
<b>2. Regression:</b> Used to quantify the relationship between one or more predictor variables and a response variable.
The following examples show how to interpret residual variance in each of these methods.
<b>Note</b>: The opposite of explained variance is known as  residual variance .
<h2>Explained Variance in ANOVA Models</h2>
Whenever we fit an ANOVA (“analysis of variance”) model, we end up with an ANOVA table that looks like the following:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/explained1-1.jpg"655">
The explained variance can be found in the SS (“sum of squares”) column for the  Between Groups variation .
In the ANOVA model above we see that the explained variance is 192.2.
To determine if this explained variance is “high” we can calculate the mean sum of squared for within groups and mean sum of squared for between groups and find the ratio between the two, which results in the overall F-value in the ANOVA table.
F = MS<sub>between</sub> / MS<sub>within</sub>
F = 96.1 / 40.76296
F = 2.357
The F-value in the ANOVA table above is 2.357 and the corresponding p-value is 0.113848.
Since this p-value is not less than α = .05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject  the null hypothesis of the ANOVA .
This means we don’t have sufficient evidence to say that the mean difference between the groups we’re comparing is significantly different.
This tells us that the explained variance in the ANOVA model is low relative to the unexplained variance.
<h2>Explained Variance in Regression Models</h2>
In a regression model, the explained variance is summarized by <b>R-squared</b>, often written R<sup>2</sup>.
This value represents the proportion of the variance in the response variable that can be explained by the predictor variable(s) in the model.
The value for R-squared can range from 0 to where:
A value of <b>0</b> indicates that the response variable cannot be explained by the predictor variable(s) at all.
A value of <b>1</b> indicates that the response variable can be perfectly explained without error by the predictor variable(s).
When we fit a regression model, we typically end up with output that looks like the following:
 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/explained2.jpg"618">
We can see that the explained variance is <b>168.5976</b> and the total variance is <b>174.5</b>.
Using these values, we can calculate the R-squared value for this regression model as:
R-squared: SS Regression / SS Total
R-squared: 168.5976 / 174.5
R-squared: <b>0.966</b>
Since the R-squared value for this model is close to 1, it tells us that the explained variance in the model is extremely high.
In other words, the model is able to do a good job of using the predictor variables to explain the variation in the response variable.
<b>Related:</b>  What is a Good R-squared Value? 
<h2><span class="orange">Explanatory & Response Variables: Definition & Examples</span></h2>
Two of the most important types of variables to understand in statistics are <b>explanatory variables</b> and <b>response variables</b>.
<b>Explanatory Variable:</b> Sometimes referred to as an <em>independent variable </em>or a <em>predictor variable</em>, this variable explains the variation in the response variable.
<b>Response Variable: </b>Sometimes referred to as a <em>dependent variable </em>or an <em>outcome variable</em>, the value of this variable responds to changes in the explanatory variable. 
In an experimental study, we’re typically interested in how the values of a response variable change as a result of the values of an explanatory variable being changed.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/explanatory_response_variable0.png">
The following examples show different scenarios involving explanatory and response variables.
<h3>Example 1: Plant Growth</h3>
A botanist wants to compare the effect that two different fertilizers have on plant growth. She randomly selects 20 plants from a field and applies fertilizer A to them for one week. She also randomly selects another 20 plants from the same field and applies fertilizer B to them for one week. After one week she measures the average plant growth for each group.
In this example, we have:
<b>Explanatory Variable: </b>Type of fertilizer. This is the variable we change so that we can observe the effect it has on plant growth.
<b>Response Variable: </b>Plant growth. This is the variable that changes as a result of the fertilizer being applied to it.
<em><b>Fun Fact: </b>We would use a  two sample t-test  to perform this experiment.</em>
<h3>Example 2: Max Vertical Jump</h3>
A basketball coach wants to compare the effect that three different training programs have on player’s max vertical jump. He randomly assigns 10 players to use training program A for one week, another 10 players to use training program B for one week, and another 10 players to use training program C for one week. At the end of the week he measures the max vertical jump of each player to see if there are significant differences between the groups.
In this example, we have:
<b>Explanatory Variable: </b>Type of training program used. This is the variable we change so that we can observe the effect it has on max vertical jump.
<b>Response Variable: </b>Max vertical jump. This is the variable that changes as a result of the training program used by the player.
<em><b>Fun Fact: </b>We would use a  one-way ANOVA  to perform this experiment.</em>
<h3>Example 3: Real Estate Prices</h3>
A real estate agent wants to understand the relationship between square footage of a house and selling price. She collects data about square footage and selling price for 100 houses in her city and analyzes the relationship between the two variables.
In this example, we have:
<b>Explanatory Variable: </b>Square footage. This is the variable that we observe change in so that we can observe the effect it has on selling price.
<b>Response Variable: </b>Selling price. This is the variable that changes as a result of the square footage of the house being changed.
<em><b>Fun Fact: </b>We would use  simple linear regression  to perform this experiment.</em>
<h3>Summary</h3>
In each of the examples above, we changed the values of some explanatory variable and observed the resulting change in values of some response variable.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform Exploratory Data Analysis in Excel</span></h2>
One of the first steps of any data analysis project is <b>exploratory data analysis</b>.
This involves exploring a dataset in three ways:
<b>1. Summarizing</b> a dataset using descriptive statistics.
<b>2. Visualizing</b> a dataset using charts.
<b>3. Identifying</b> missing values.
By performing these three actions, you can gain an understanding of how the values in a dataset are distributed and detect any problematic values before proceeding to perform a  hypothesis test , fit a  regression model , or perform statistical modeling.
The following step-by-step example shows how to  perform exploratory data analysis in Excel.
<h3>Step 1: Create the Dataset</h3>
First, let’s create a simple dataset that contains information about 10 different basketball players:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eda_excel1.jpg"533">
This dataset contains three variables (Points, Rebounds, Assists) and some of the variables have blank or NA values, which is common in real-world datasets.
<h3>Step 2: Summarize the Data</h3>
Next, we can calculate the mean, median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum values for each of the three variables in this dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eda_excel2.jpg"534">

<b>B14</b>: =MEDIAN(B2:B11)
<b>B15</b>: =QUARTILE(B2:B11, 1)
<b>B16</b>: =QUARTILE(B2:B11, 3)
<b>B17</b>: =MIN(B2:B11)
<b>B18</b>: =MAX(B2:B11)
We then dragged each formula to the right so that we could calculate the same metrics for the values in columns C and D.
By calculating these descriptive statistics for each variable, we can gain a good understanding of the distribution of values for each variable.
<b>Note</b>: Each formula automatically ignores blank or NA values when calculating each descriptive statistic.
<h3>Step 3: Visualize the Data</h3>
We can also create charts to visualize the values in the dataset.
For example, to visualize the distribution of values for the Points variable, we can highlight the values in the cell range <b>B2:B11</b>, then click the <b>Insert</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click the <b>Histogram</b> icon within the <b>Charts</b> group:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eda_excel3.jpg"542">
The following histogram will automatically be created:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eda_excel4.jpg"527">
This histogram allows us to visualize the distribution of points scored by the players.
For example, we can see:
4 players scored between 10 and 15 points.
1 player scored between 15 and 20 points.
2 players scored between 20 and 25 points.
3 players scored between 25 and 30 points.
We can repeat this process for each variable in our dataset to visualize the distribution of values for each variable.
<h3>Step 4: Identify Missing Values</h3>
We can also use the following formula to count the number of missing values in column B:
<b>=SUMPRODUCT(--NOT(ISNUMBER(B2:B11)))</b>
We can type this formula into cell <b>B19</b> and then drag it to the right to calculate the number of missing values for each variable in the dataset:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eda_excel5.jpg"506">
From the output we can see:
There are <b>0</b> missing values in the Points column.
There are <b>2</b> missing values in the Rebounds column.
There is <b>1</b> missing value in the Assists column.
We have now completed a basic exploratory data analysis on this dataset and have gained a pretty good understanding of how the values are distributed for each variable in this dataset.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform Exploratory Data Analysis in R (With Example)</span></h2>
One of the first steps of any data analysis project is <b>exploratory data analysis</b>.
This involves exploring a dataset in three ways:
<b>1. Summarizing</b> a dataset using descriptive statistics.
<b>2. Visualizing</b> a dataset using charts.
<b>3. Identifying</b> missing values.
By performing these three actions, you can gain an understanding of how the values in a dataset are distributed and detect any problematic values before proceeding to perform a hypothesis test or perform statistical modeling.
The easiest way to perform exploratory data analysis in R is by using functions from the  tidyverse  packages.
The following step-by-step example shows how to use functions from these packages to perform exploratory data analysis on the <b>diamonds</b> dataset that comes built-in with the tidyverse packages.
<h3>Step 1: Load & View the Data</h3>
First, let’s use the <b>data()</b> function to load the <b>diamonds</b> dataset:
<b>library(tidyverse)
#load <em>diamonds</em> dataset
data(diamonds)</b>
We can take a look at the first six rows of the dataset by using the <b>head()</b> function:
<b>#view first six rows of diamonds dataset
head(diamonds)

</b>
<h3>Step 2: Summarize the Data</h3>
We can use the <b>summary()</b> function to quickly summarize each variable in the dataset:
<b>#summarize diamonds dataset
summary(diamonds)

For each of the numeric variables we can see the following information:
<b>Min</b>: The minimum value.
<b>1st Qu</b>: The value of the first quartile (25th percentile).
<b>Median</b>: The median value.
<b>Mean</b>: The mean value.
<b>3rd Qu</b>: The value of the third quartile (75th percentile).
<b>Max</b>: The maximum value.
For the categorical variables in the dataset (cut, color, and clarity) we see a frequency count of each value.
 For example, for the <b>cut</b> variable:
<b>Fair</b>: This value occurs 1,610 times.
<b>Good</b>: This value occurs 4,906 times.
<b>Very Good</b>: This value occurs 12,082 times.
<b>Premium</b>: This value occurs 13,791 times.
<b>Ideal</b>: This value occurs 21,551 times.
We can use the <b>dim()</b> function to get the dimensions of the dataset in terms of number of rows and number of columns:
<b>#display rows and columns
dim(diamonds)
[1] 53940 10
</b>
We can see that the dataset has <b>53,940 </b>rows and <b>10</b> columns.
<h3>Step 3: Visualize the Data</h3>
We can also create charts to visualize the values in the dataset.
For example, we can use the <b>geom_histogram()</b> function to create a histogram of the values for a certain variable:
<b>#create histogram of values for price
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="steelblue", color="black") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Price Values")
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/diamonds2.jpg"566">
We can also use the <b>geom_point()</b> function to create a scatterplot of any pairwise combination of variables:
<b>#create scatterplot of carat vs. price, using cut as color variable
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + 
  geom_point()
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/diamonds3.jpg"593">
We can also use the <b>geom_boxplot()</b> function to create a boxplot of one variable grouped by another variable:
<b>#create scatterplot of price, grouped by cut
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="steelblue")
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/diamonds4.jpg"556">
We can also use the <b>cor()</b> function to create a correlation matrix to view the  correlation coefficient  between each pairwise combination of numeric variables in the dataset:
<b>#create correlation matrix of (rounded to 2 decimal places)
round(cor(diamonds[c('carat', 'depth', 'table', 'price', 'x', 'y', 'z')]), 2)
      carat depth table price     x     y    z

z      0.95  0.09  0.15  0.86  0.97  0.95 1.00
</b>

<h3>Step 4: Identify Missing Values</h3>
We can use the following code to count the total number of missing values in each column of the dataset:
<b>#count total missing values in each column
sapply(diamonds, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
  carat     cut   color clarity   depth   table   price       x       y       z 
      0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0</b>
From the output we can see that there are zero missing values in each column.
In practice, you’ll likely encounter several missing values throughout your dataset.
This function will be useful for counting the total number of missing values.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform Exploratory Data Analysis in Python</span></h2>
One of the first steps of any data analysis project is <b>exploratory data analysis</b>.
This involves exploring a dataset in three ways:
<b>1. Summarizing</b> a dataset using descriptive statistics.
<b>2. Visualizing</b> a dataset using charts.
<b>3. Identifying</b> missing values.
By performing these three actions, you can gain an understanding of how the values in a dataset are distributed and detect any problematic values before proceeding to perform a hypothesis test or perform statistical modeling.
The following step-by-step example shows how to perform exploratory data analysis for a dataset in Python.
<h3>Step 1: Create the Data</h3>
First, let’s create the following pandas DataFrame:
<b>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
#create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'team': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'],   'points': [18, 22, 19, 14, 14, 11, 20, 28],   'assists': [5, 7, 7, 9, 12, 9, 9, 4],   'rebounds': [11, 8, 10, 6, 6, np.nan, 9, 12]})
</b>
We can take a look at the first five rows of the DataFrame by using the <b>head()</b> function:
<b>#view first five rows of dataset
df.head()
teampointsassistsrebounds
0A18511.0
1A2278.0
2A19710.0
3A1496.0
4B14126.0
</b>
<h3>Step 2: Summarize the Data</h3>
We can use the <b>describe()</b> function to quickly summarize each numerical variable in the dataset:
<b>#summarize numerical variables
df.describe()
           pointsassists rebounds
count8.00000008.00000 7.000000

max28.00000012.0000         12.00000</b>
For each of the numeric variables we can see the following information:
<b>count</b>: Total number of non-missing values
<b>std</b>: The mean value
<b>min</b>: The minimum value
<b>25%</b>: The value of the first quartile (25th percentile)
<b>50%</b>: The median value (50th percentile)
<b>75%</b>: The value of the third quartile (75th percentile)
<b>max</b>: The maximum value
For the categorical variables in the dataset, we can use <b>value_counts</b> to get a frequency count of each value:
<b>#display frequency counts for team variable
df['team'].value_counts()
A    4
B    4
Name: team, dtype: int64</b>
 From the output we can see:
<b>A</b>: This value occurs 4 times.
<b>B</b>: This value occurs 4 times.
We can use the <b>shape</b> function to get the dimensions of the DataFrame in terms of number of rows and number of columns:
<b>#display rows and columns
df.shape
(8, 4)
</b>
We can see that the DataFrame has <b>8 </b>rows and <b>4 </b>columns.
<h3>Step 3: Visualize the Data</h3>
We can also create charts to visualize the values in the dataset.
For example, we can use the pandas <b>hist()</b> function to create a histogram of the values for each numerical variable:
<b>#create histogram for each numerical variable
df.hist(grid=False, edgecolor='black')
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eda1.jpg"528">
The x-axis of each histogram shows the values for each variable and the y-axis shows the frequency of each value.
We can also use the pandas <b>boxplot()</b> function to create a boxplot for each numerical variable:
<b>#create boxplot for each numerical variable
df.boxplot(grid=False)
</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eda2.jpg"523">
We can also use the <b>geom_boxplot()</b> function to create a boxplot of one variable grouped by another variable:
We can also use the pandas <b>corr()</b> function to create a correlation matrix to view the  correlation coefficient  between each pairwise combination of numeric variables in the DataFrame:
<b>#create correlation matrix
df.corr()
          points  assists rebounds
points 1.000000-0.725841 0.767007
assists-0.725841 1.000000-0.882046
rebounds 0.767007-0.882046 1.000000
</b>
<b>Related:</b>  What is Considered to Be a “Strong” Correlation? 
<h3>Step 4: Identify Missing Values</h3>
We can use the following code to count the total number of missing values in each column of the DataFrame:
<b>#count total missing values in each column
df.isnull().sum()
team        0
points      0
assists     0
rebounds    1
dtype: int64
</b>
From the output we can see that there is only one missing value in the <b>rebounds</b> column.
All other columns have no missing values.
We have now completed a basic exploratory data analysis on this dataset and have a good understanding of how the values are distributed for each variable in this dataset.

<h2><span class="orange">How to Use the Exponential Distribution in Excel</span></h2>
The  exponential distribution  is a probability distribution that is used to model the time we must wait until a certain event occurs.
This distribution can be used to answer questions like:
How long does a shop owner need to wait until a customer enters his shop?
How long will a battery continue to work before it dies?
How long will a computer continue to work before it breaks down?
In each scenario, we’re interested in calculating how long we’ll have to wait until a certain event occurs. Thus, each scenario could be modeled using an exponential distribution.
If a  random variable  <em>X</em> follows an exponential distribution, then the cumulative density function of <em>X</em> can be written as:
<b><em>F</em>(x; λ) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup></b>
where:
<b>λ:</b> the rate parameter (calculated as λ = 1/μ)
<b>e:</b> A constant roughly equal to 2.718
To calculate probabilities related to the cumulative density function of the exponential distribution in Excel, we can use the following formula:
<b>=EXPON.DIST(x, lambda, cumulative)
</b>
where:
<b>x</b>: the value of the exponentially distributed random variable
<b>lambda</b>: the rate parameter
<b>cumulative</b>: whether to use the cumulative density function or not (TRUE or FALSE)
The following examples show how to use this formula in practice.
<h3>Example 1: Time Until Next Customer Arrives</h3>
 A new customer enters a shop every two minutes, on average. After a customer arrives, find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute.
<b>Solution: </b>The average time between customers is two minutes. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/2
λ = 0.5
Thus, we can use the following formula in Excel to calculate the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exponExcel1.png">
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than one minute for the next customer to arrive is <b>0.393469</b>.
<h3>Example 2: Time Until Next Earthquake</h3>
Suppose an earthquake occurs every 400 days in a certain region, on average. After an earthquake occurs, find the probability that it will take more than 500 days for the next earthquake to occur.
<b>Solution:</b> The average time between earthquakes is 400 days. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/400
λ = 0.0025
Thus, we can use the following formula in Excel to calculate the probability that the next earthquake takes less than 500 days to occur:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exponExcel2.png">
The probability that it will take less than 500 days for the next earthquake is 0.7135.
Thus, the probability that we’ll have to wait <em>more</em> than 500 days for the next earthquake is 1 – 0.7135 = <b>0.2865</b>.
<h3>Example 3: Time Until Next Phone Call</h3>
Suppose a call center receives a new call every 10 minutes, on average. After a customer calls, find the probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes.
<b>Solution:</b> The average time between calls is 10 minutes. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:

λ = 1/10
λ = 0.1
Thus, we can use the following formula in Excel to calculate the probability that the next customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes:

<h3>How to Generate an Exponential Distribution</h3>
You can use the <b>expon.rvs(scale, size)</b> function from the SciPy library in Python to generate random values from an exponential distribution with a specific rate parameter and sample size:
<b>from scipy.stats import expon
#generate random values from exponential distribution with rate=40 and sample size=10

<h3>How to Calculate Probabilities Using an Exponential Distribution</h3>
Suppose the mean number of minutes between eruptions for a certain geyser is 40 minutes. What is the probability that we’ll have to wait less than 50 minutes for an eruption?
To solve this, we need to first calculate the rate parameter:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/40
λ = .025
We can plug in λ = .025 and x = 50 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 50) = 1 – e<sup>-.025(50)</sup>
P(X ≤ 50) = 0.7135
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than 50 minutes for the next eruption is <b>0.7135</b>.
We can use the <b>expon.cdf()</b> function from SciPy to solve this problem in Python:
<b>from scipy.stats import expon
#calculate probability that x is less than 50 when mean rate is 40
expon.cdf(x=50, scale=40)
0.7134952031398099
</b>
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than 50 minutes for the next eruption is <b>0.7135</b>.
This matches the value that we calculated by hand.
<h3>How to Plot an Exponential Distribution</h3>
You can use the following syntax to plot an exponential distribution with a given rate parameter:
<b>from scipy.stats import expon
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#generate exponential distribution with sample size 10000
x = expon.rvs(scale=40, size=10000)
#create plot of exponential distribution
plt.hist(x, density=True, edgecolor='black')

In this article we share 5 examples of the exponential distribution in real life.
<h3>Example 1: Time Between Geyser Eruptions</h3>
The number of minutes between eruptions for a certain geyser can be modeled by the exponential distribution.
For example, suppose the mean number of minutes between eruptions for a certain geyser is 40 minutes. If a geyser just erupts, what is the probability that we’ll have to wait less than 50 minutes for the next eruption?
To solve this, we need to first calculate the rate parameter:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/40
λ = .025
We can plug in λ = .025 and x = 50 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 50) = 1 – e<sup>-.025(50)</sup>
P(X ≤ 50) = 0.7135

<h3>Example 2: Time Between Customers</h3>
The number of minutes between customers who enter a certain shop can be modeled by the exponential distribution.
For example, suppose a new customer enters a shop every two minutes, on average. After a customer arrives, find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute.
To solve this, we can start by knowing that the average time between customers is two minutes. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/2
λ = 0.5
We can plug in λ = 0.5 and x = 1 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 1 – e<sup>-0.5(1)</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 0.3935
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than one minute for the next customer to arrive is <b>0.3935</b>.
<h3>
<b>Example 3: Time Between Earthquakes </b>
</h3>
The time between earthquake occurrences can be modeled using an exponential distribution. 
For example, suppose an earthquake occurs every 400 days in a certain region, on average. After an earthquake occurs, find the probability that it will take more than 500 days for the next earthquake to occur.
To solve this, we start by knowing that the average time between earthquakes is 400 days. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/400
λ = 0.0025
We can plug in λ = 0.0025 and x = 500 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 1 – e<sup>-0.0025(500)</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 0.7135
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than 500 days for the next earthquake is 0.7135.
Thus, the probability that we’ll have to wait <em>more</em> than 500 days for the next earthquake is 1 – 0.7135 = <b>0.2865</b>.
<h3>Example 4: Time Between Calls</h3>
The time between customer calls at different businesses can be modeled using an exponential distribution.
For example, suppose a bank receives a new call every 10 minutes, on average. After a customer calls, find the probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes.
To solve this , we start by knowing that the average time between calls is 10 minutes. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/10
λ = 0.1
We can use the following formula to calculate the probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes:
P(10 &lt; X ≤ 15) = (1 – e<sup>-0.1(15)</sup>)  –  (1 – e<sup>-0.1(10)</sup>)
P(10 &lt; X ≤ 15) = .7769 – .6321
P(10 &lt; X ≤ 15) = 0.1448
The probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes. is <b>0.1448</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">An Introduction to the Exponential Distribution</span></h2>
The <b>exponential distribution</b> is a probability distribution that is used to model the time we must wait until a certain event occurs.
This distribution can be used to answer questions like:
How long does a shop owner need to wait until a customer enters his shop?
How long will a laptop continue to work before it breaks down?
How long will a car battery continue to work before it dies?
How long do we need to wait until the next volcanic eruption in a certain region?
In each scenario, we’re interested in calculating how long we’ll have to wait until a certain event occurs. Thus, each scenario could be modeled using an exponential distribution.
<h3>Exponential Distribution: PDF & CDF</h3>
If a  random variable  <em>X</em> follows an exponential distribution, then the <b>probability density function</b> of <em>X</em> can be written as:
<b><em>f</em>(x; λ) = λe<sup>-λx</sup></b>
where:
<b>λ:</b> the rate parameter (calculated as λ = 1/μ)
<b>e:</b> A constant roughly equal to 2.718
The <b>cumulative distribution function</b> of <em>X</em> can be written as:
<b><em>F</em>(x; λ) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup></b>
In practice, the CDF is used most often to calculate probabilities related to the exponential distribution.
For example, suppose the mean number of minutes between eruptions for a certain geyser is 40 minutes. What is the probability that we’ll have to wait less than 50 minutes for an eruption?
To solve this, we need to first calculate the rate parameter:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/40
λ = .025
We can plug in λ = .025 and x = 50 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 50) = 1 – e<sup>-.025(50)</sup>
P(X ≤ 50) = 0.7135
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than 50 minutes for the next eruption is <b>0.7135</b>.
<h3>Visualizing the Exponential Distribution</h3>
The following plot shows the <b>probability density function</b> of a random variable <em>X</em> that follows an exponential distribution with different rate parameters:

<b>Note:</b> Check out  this tutorial  to learn how to plot an exponential distribution in R.
<h3>Properties of the Exponential Distribution</h3>
The exponential distribution has the following properties:
Mean:<b> 1 / λ</b>
Variance: <b>1 / <b>λ<sup>2</sup></b></b>
For example, suppose the mean number of minutes between eruptions for a certain geyser is 40 minutes. We would calculate the rate as λ = 1/μ = 1/40 = .025.
We could then calculate the following properties for this distribution:
Mean waiting time for next eruption: 1/λ = 1 /.025 = <b>40</b>
Variance in waiting times for next eruption: 1/λ<sup>2</sup> = 1 /.025<sup>2</sup> = <b>1600</b>
<em><b>Note:</b> The exponential distribution also has a  memoryless property , which means the probability of some future event occurring is not affected by the occurrence of  past events.</em>
<h3>Exponential Distribution Practice Problems</h3>
Use the following practice problems to test your knowledge of the exponential distribution.
<b>Question 1:</b> A new customer enters a shop every two minutes, on average. After a customer arrives, find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute.
<b>Solution 1:</b> The average time between customers is two minutes. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/2
λ = 0.5
We can plug in λ = 0.5 and x = 1 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 1 – e<sup>-0.5(1)</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 0.3935
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than one minute for the next customer to arrive is <b>0.3935</b>.
<b>Question 2:</b> An earthquake occurs every 400 days in a certain region, on average. After an earthquake occurs, find the probability that it will take more than 500 days for the next earthquake to occur.
<b>Solution 2:</b> The average time between earthquakes is 400 days. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/400
λ = 0.0025
We can plug in λ = 0.0025 and x = 500 to the formula for the CDF:
P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e<sup>-λx</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 1 – e<sup>-0.0025(500)</sup>
P(X ≤ 1) = 0.7135
The probability that we’ll have to wait less than 500 days for the next earthquake is 0.7135. Thus, the probability that we’ll have to wait <em>more</em> than 500 days for the next earthquake is 1 – 0.7135 = <b>0.2865</b>.
<b>Question 3:</b> A call center receives a new call every 10 minutes, on average. After a customer calls, find the probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes.
<b>Solution 3:</b> The average time between calls is 10 minutes. Thus, the rate can be calculated as:
 λ = 1/μ
λ = 1/10
λ = 0.1
We can use the following formula to calculate the probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes:
P(10 &lt; X ≤ 15) = (1 – e<sup>-0.1(15)</sup>)  –  (1 – e<sup>-0.1(10)</sup>)
P(10 &lt; X ≤ 15) = .7769 – .6321
P(10 &lt; X ≤ 15) = 0.1448
The probability that a new customer calls within 10 to 15 minutes. is <b>0.1448</b>.
<h2><span class="orange">Exponential Moving Average in Google Sheets (Step-by-Step)</span></h2>
In time series analysis, a <b>moving average </b>is simply the average value of a certain number of previous periods.
An <b>exponential moving average </b>is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent observations, which means it’s able to capture recent trends more quickly.
The following step-by-step example shows how to calculate an exponential moving average in Google Sheets.
<h3>Step 1: Enter the Data</h3>
First, let’s enter the following dataset that shows the total sales made by a company during 10 consecutive sales periods:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/expSheets1.png">
<h3>Step 2: Calculate the Exponential Moving Average</h3>
Next, we’ll calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) using the following formula:
<b>EMV = [Latest Value  - Previous EMA] * (2/n+1) + Previous EMA
</b>
In the formula, <b>n</b> represents the number of periods to use to calculate the exponential moving average. This is the one number that you must specify.
For our example, we’ll calculate a 3-day EMA. First, we’ll enter the EMA value in cell B2 to be equal to the value in cell A2:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/expSheets2.png">
Next, we’ll use the following formula to calculate the first value for the 3-day EMA:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/expSheets3.png">
Next, hover over the bottom right corner of cell B3 until a tiny “<b>+</b>” cross appears. Double click the cross to copy and paste the formula down to the remaining cells in the column:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/expSheets4.png">
That’s it! Column A shows the sales and column B shows the 3-day exponential moving average of the sales.

<h3>Example: Exponential Moving Average in R</h3>
Suppose we have the following data frame in R:
<b>#create data frame
df &lt;- data.frame(period=1:10, sales=c(25, 20, 14, 16, 27, 20, 12, 15, 14, 19))

10     10    19
</b>
We can use the  movavg() function  from the <b>pracma</b> package to calculate the exponentially weighted moving average for a certain number of previous periods.
This function uses the following syntax:
<b>movavg(x, n, type=c(“s”, “t”, “w”, “m”, “e”, “r”))</b>
where:
<b>x:</b> Time series as numeric vector
<b>n:</b> Number of previous periods to use for average
<b>type:</b> Type of moving average to calculate. We will use “e” for exponential weighted moving average.
For example, here’s how to calculate the exponentially weighted moving average using the four previous periods:
<b>library(pracma)
#create new column to hold 4-day exponentially weighted moving average

library(reshape2)
#melt data into format for easy plotting
df &lt;- melt(df ,  id.vars = 'period', variable.name = 'series')
#plot sales vs. 4-day exponentially weighted moving average

</b>

where:
<b>y:</b> The response variable
<b>x:</b> The predictor variable
<b>a, b:</b> The regression coefficients that describe the relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
The following step-by-step example shows how to perform exponential regression in Excel.
<h3>Step 1: Create the Data</h3>
First, let’s create a fake dataset that contains 20  observations :
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/expRegExcel3.png">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/expRegExcel4.png">
<h3>Step 3: Fit the Exponential Regression Model</h3>
Next, we’ll fit the exponential regression model. To do so, click the <b>Data</b> tab along the top ribbon, then click <b>Data Analysis</b> within the <b>Analysis</b> group.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/twoSampExcel3.png">
<em>If you don’t see Data Analysis as an option, you need to first  load the Analysis ToolPak .</em>
In the window that pops up, click <b>Regression</b>. In the new window that pops up, fill in the following information:

The  overall F-value  of the model is 204.006 and the corresponding p-value is extremely small, which indicates that the model as a whole is useful.
Using the coefficients from the output table, we can see that the fitted exponential regression equation is:
<b>ln(y) = 0.9817 + 0.2041(x)</b>
Applying <em>e</em> to both sides, we can rewrite the equation as:
<b>y = 2.6689 * 1.2264<sup>x</sup></b>
We can use this equation to predict the response variable, <em>y</em>, based on the value of the predictor variable, <em>x</em>. For example, if <em>x</em> = 14, then we would predict that <em>y</em> would be <b>46.47</b>:

</b>
<h3>Step 2: Visualize the Data</h3>
Next, let’s create a quick scatterplot to visualize the relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>:
<b>plot(x, y)</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/expRegR1.png">
From the plot we can see that there exists a clear exponential growth pattern between the two variables.
Thus, it seems like a good idea to fit an exponential regression equation to describe the relationship between the variables.
<h3>Step 3: Fit the Exponential Regression Model</h3>
Next, we’ll use the <b>lm()</b> function to fit an exponential regression model, using the natural log of <em>y</em> as the  response variable  and <em>x</em> as the predictor variable:

The equation of an exponential regression model takes the following form:
y = ab<sup>x</sup>
where:
<b>y:</b> The response variable
<b>x:</b> The predictor variable
<b>a, b:</b> The regression coefficients that describe the relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
The following step-by-step example shows how to perform exponential regression in Python.
<h3>Step 1: Create the Data</h3>
First, let’s create some fake data for two variables: <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>:
<b>import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1, 21, 1)
y = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19, 23, 28,
              33, 38, 44, 50, 56, 64, 73, 84, 97, 113])
</b>
<h3>Step 2: Visualize the Data</h3>
Next, let’s create a quick scatterplot to visualize the relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>:
<b>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/expRegPython1.png">
From the plot we can see that there exists a clear exponential growth pattern between the two variables.
Thus, it seems like a good idea to fit an exponential regression equation to describe the relationship between the variables as opposed to a linear regression model.
<h3>Step 3: Fit the Exponential Regression Model</h3>
Next, we’ll use the <b>polyfit()</b> function to fit an exponential regression model, using the natural log of <em>y</em> as the response variable and <em>x</em> as the predictor variable:
<b>#fit the model
fit = np.polyfit(x, np.log(y), 1)
<b>
#view the output of the model
print(fit)
[0.2041002  0.98165772]
</b></b>
Based on the output, the fitted exponential regression equation can be written as:
<b>ln(y) = 0.9817 + 0.2041(x)</b>
Applying <em>e</em> to both sides, we can rewrite the equation as:
<b>y = 2.6689 * 1.2264<sup>x</sup></b>
We can use this equation to predict the response variable, <em>y</em>, based on the value of the predictor variable, <em>x</em>. For example, if <em>x</em> = 12, then we would predict that <em>y</em> would be <b>30.897</b>:
y = 2.6689 * 1.2264<sup>12</sup> = 30.897

<h3>Step 3: Interpret the Results</h3>
From the results we can see that the fitted exponential model is:
<b>y = 1.727 * 1.651<sup>x</sup></b>
We can use this equation to predict the response variable, <em>y</em>, based on the value of the predictor variable, <em>x</em>. For example, if <em>x</em> = 4, then we would predict that <em>y</em> would be <b>12.83</b>:
y = 1.727 * 1.651<sup>4</sup> = 12.83

<h2><span class="orange">How to Perform Exponential Smoothing in Excel</span></h2>
<b>Exponential smoothing </b>is a technique for “smoothing” out time series data and is often used for short-term forecasting.
The basic idea is that time series data often has “random noise” associated with it, which leads to peaks and valleys in the data, but by applying exponential smoothing we can smooth out these peaks and valleys to see the true underlying trend of the data.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/expSmooth2.png">
The basic formula for applying exponential smoothing is as follows:
<b>F<sub>t</sub> = αy<sub>t-1</sub> + (1 – α) F<sub>t-1</sub></b>
where:
<b>F<sub>t</sub></b> = Forecasted value for current time period <em>t</em>
<b>α</b> = The value for the smoothing constant, between 0 and 1
<b>y</b><sub><b>t-1</b> </sub>= The actual data value for the previous time period 
<b>F<sub>t-1</sub> </b>= Forecasted value for previous time period <em>t-1</em>
The smaller the alpha value, the more the time series data is smoothed out.
In this tutorial, we show how to perform exponential smoothing for time series data using a built-in function in Excel.
<h2>Example: Exponential Smoothing in Excel</h2>
Suppose we have the following dataset that shows the sales for a particular company for 10 sales periods:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/expSmooth1.png">
Perform the following steps to apply exponential smoothing to this time series data.
<b>Step 1: Click on the “Data Analysis” button.</b>
Go to the “Data” tab along the top ribbon and click the “Data Analysis” button. If you don’t see this button, you need to first  load the Excel Analysis ToolPak , which is completely free to use.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/twoSampExcel3.png">
<b>Step 2: Choose the “Exponential Smoothing” option and click OK.</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/expSmooth3.png">
<b>Step 3: Fill in the necessary values.</b>
Fill in the data values for<b> Input Range</b>.
Select the value you’d like to use for <b>Damping Factor</b>, which is 1-α. If you’d like to use α = 0.2, then your damping factor will be 1-0.2 = 0.8.
Select the<b> Output Range</b> where you’d like the forecasted values to appear. It’s a good idea to choose this output range right next to your actual data values so you can easily compare the actual values and the forecasted values side by side.
If you would like to see a chart displayed with the actual and the forecasted values, select the box that says <b>Chart Output</b>.
Then, click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/expSmooth4-2.png">
A list of forecasted values and a chart will automatically appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/expSmooth5.png">
Note that the first time period has a value of #N/A because there is no previous time period to use to calculate the forecasted value.
<h2>Experimenting with Smoothing Factors</h2>
You can experiment with different values for the smoothing factor α and see how it impacts the forecasted values. You’ll notice that the smaller the value for α (larger value for Damping Factor), the more smoothed out the forecasted values will be:

<h2><span class="orange">How to Export a Data Frame to a CSV File in R (With Examples)</span></h2>
Suppose we have the following data frame in R:
<b>#create data frame
df &lt;- data.frame(team=c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'), points=c(78, 85, 93, 90, 91), assists=c(12, 20, 23, 8, 14))
#view data frame
df
  team points assists
1    A     78      12
2    B     85      20
3    C     93      23
4    D     90       8
5    E     91      14</b>
There are three common ways to export this data frame to a CSV file in R:
<b>1. Use write.csv from base R</b>
If your data frame is reasonably small, you can just use the <b>write.csv</b> function from base R to export it to a CSV file.
When using this method, be sure to specify <b>row.names=FALSE</b> if you don’t want R to export the row names to the CSV file.
<b>write.csv(df, "C:\\Users\\Bob\\Desktop\\data.csv", row.names=FALSE)
</b>
<b>2. Use write_csv from reader package</b>
An even faster way to export a data frame to a CSV file is with the <b>write_csv</b> function from the reader package. This is about 2x faster than write.csv and it never writes the row names from the data frame to a CSV file.
<b>library(readr)
write_csv(df, "C:\\Users\\Bob\\Desktop\\data.csv")
</b>
<b>3. Use fwrite from data.table package</b>
Yet a faster way (and a recommended method for large datasets) to export a data frame to a CSV file is with the <b>fwrite</b> function from the data.table package. This function is about 2x faster than the write_csv method.
<b>library(data.table)
fwrite(df, "C:\\Users\\Bob\\Desktop\\data.csv")</b>
Note that in each example we used double backslashes (\\) in the file path to avoid the following common error:
<b>Error: '\U' used without hex digits in character string starting ""C:\U"</b>
<h3>The Output</h3>
Each of the three methods above produce an identical CSV file. If we open this file with Excel, here’s what it looks like:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/export1.png">

<b>Method 2: Extract Regression Coefficients with Standard Error, T-Statistic, & P-values</b>
<b>summary(model)$coefficients</b>
The following example shows how to use these methods in practice.
<h3>Example: Extract Regression Coefficients from lm() in R</h3>
Suppose we fit the following multiple linear regression model in R:
<b>#create data frame

<h2><span class="orange">Extraneous Variable: Definition & Examples</span></h2>
The whole point of conducting an experiment is to determine whether or not changing the values of some independent variable has an effect on a dependent variable.
An <b>extraneous variable </b>is any variable you’re not interested in studying that could also have some effect on the dependent variable.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/extraneous1.png">
For example, we might want to know how the number of hours that a basketball player trains per week affects their average points per game. However, an extraneous variable that could also affect their points per game is the number of hours they spend stretching each week.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/extraneous2.png">
We would need to make sure that we control for this extraneous variable so that we can draw reliable conclusions about the effect that hours spent training has on average points per game.
<h3>Types of Extraneous Variables</h3>
There are four types of extraneous variables:
<b>1. Situational Variables</b>
These are aspects of the environment that could affect the way an individual behaves in an experiment. Examples include:
Lighting conditions
Noise
Visual distractions
Temperature
<b>2. Experimenter Bias</b>
This refers to ways in which the experimenter may accidently bias the way that individuals behave in an experiment. Examples include:
Using certain phrasing to hint at the way researchers want individuals to behave.
Speaking in a positive or negative tone when providing instructions to individuals.
<b>3. Demand Characteristics</b>
This refers to any clues in the experiment that could give away the true purpose of the research to the individuals. Examples include:
Their surroundings.
Their interpretation of what is happening in the situation.
The researcher’s behavior.
<b>4. Participant Variables</b>
This refers to the natural variance among individuals and the ways in which this could affect the results of the experiment. Examples include:
An individual’s natural intelligence.
An individuals’ mood that day.
An individual’s physical abilities.
An individual’s ability to concentrate.
<h3>How to Control Extraneous Variables</h3>
There are four main ways to control for extraneous variables in an experiment:
<b>1. Consistent environment.</b>
Each individual should be able to participate in an experiment in the exact same environment, e.g. with the same lighting conditions, same noise levels, same temperature, and same number of potential distractions. This should minimize the effect of situational variables and demand characteristics.
<b>2. Experimental design.</b>
By designing an experiment such that individuals are randomly assigned to treatment groups and such that researchers are also blind to which individuals belong to which group, this should minimize the problem of experimental bias.
<b>3. Randomization.</b>
By randomly assigning individuals to treatments (e.g. high training volume vs. low training volume), any differences in participant ability between groups should be roughly evenly distributed. This should minimize the problem of participant variables.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
By using a consistent environment, experimental design, and randomization, researchers can minimize the effect that potential extraneous variables can have on experiment.
Thus, when researchers draw conclusions about the effect that an independent variable has on a dependent variable, they can be sure that no extraneous variables are actually causing the true effect.
<h2><span class="orange">How to Find the F Critical Value in Excel</span></h2>
When you conduct an F test, you will get an F statistic as a result. To determine if the results of the F test are statistically significant, you can compare the F statistic to an <b>F critical value</b>. If the F statistic is greater than the F critical value, then the results of the test are statistically significant.
The F critical value can be found by using an  F distribution table  or by using statistical software.
To find the F critical value, you need:
A significance level (common choices are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10)
Numerator degrees of freedom
Denominator degrees of freedom
Using these three values, you can determine the F critical value to be compared with the F statistic.
<h2>How to Find the F Critical Value in Excel</h2>
To find the F critical value in Excel, you can use the<b> F.INV.RT()</b> function, which uses the following syntax:
<b>F.INV.RT</b>(probability, deg_freedom1, deg_freedom2)
<b>probability: </b>The significance level to use
<b>deg_freedom1</b>: The numerator degrees of freedom
<b>deg_freedom2</b>: The denominator degrees of freedom
This function returns the critical value from the F distribution based on the significance level, numerator degrees of freedom, and denominator degrees of freedom provided.
For example, suppose we would like to find the F critical value for a significance level of 0.05, numerator degrees of freedom = 4, and denominator degrees of freedom = 6. 
In Excel, we can type the following formula: <b>F.INV.RT(0.05, 4, 6)</b>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://fourpillarfreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/f_critical_excel.jpg">
This returns the value <b>4.5337</b>. This is the critical value for a significance level of 0.05, numerator degrees of freedom = 4, and denominator degrees of freedom = 6.
Note that this also matches the number we would find in the  F distribution table  with α = 0.05, DF1 <em>(numerator degrees of freedom)</em> = 4, and DF2 <em>(denominator degrees of freedom)</em> = 6.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://fourpillarfreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/f_critical_excel2.jpg">
<h2>Cautions on Finding the F Critical Value in Excel</h2>
Note that the <b>F.INV.RT()</b> function in Excel will throw an error if any of the following occur:
If any argument is non-numeric.
If the value for <em>probability </em>is less than zero or greater than 1.
If the value for <em>deg_freedom 1 </em>or <em>deg_freedom2 </em>is less than 1.
 
<h2><span class="orange">How to Find the F Critical Value in Python</span></h2>
When you conduct an F test, you will get an F statistic as a result. To determine if the results of the F test are statistically significant, you can compare the F statistic to an <b>F critical value</b>. If the F statistic is greater than the F critical value, then the results of the test are statistically significant.
The F critical value can be found by using an  F distribution table  or by using statistical software.
To find the F critical value, you need:
A significance level (common choices are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10)
Numerator degrees of freedom
Denominator degrees of freedom
Using these three values, you can determine the F critical value to be compared with the F statistic.
<h3>How to Find the F Critical Value in Python</h3>
To find the F critical value in Python, you can use the  scipy.stats.f.ppf() function , which uses the following syntax:
<b>scipy.stats.f.ppf(q, dfn, dfd)</b>
where:
<b>q: </b>The significance level to use
<b>dfn</b>: The numerator degrees of freedom
<b>dfd</b>: The denominator degrees of freedom
This function returns the critical value from the F distribution based on the significance level, numerator degrees of freedom, and denominator degrees of freedom provided.
For example, suppose we would like to find the F critical value for a significance level of 0.05, numerator degrees of freedom = 6, and denominator degrees of freedom = 8. 
<b>import scipy.stats
#find F critical value
scipy.stats.f.ppf(q=1-.05, dfn=6, dfd=8)
3.5806</b>
The F critical value for a significance level of 0.05, numerator degrees of freedom = 6, and denominator degrees of freedom = 8 is <b>3.5806</b>.
Thus, if we’re conducting some type of F test then we can compare the F test statistic to <b>3.5806</b>. If the F statistic is greater than 3.580, then the results of the test are statistically significant.
Note that smaller values of alpha will lead to larger F critical values. For example, consider the F critical value for a significance level of <b>0.01</b>, numerator degrees of freedom = 6, and denominator degrees of freedom = 8. 
<b>scipy.stats.f.ppf(q=1-.01, dfn=6, dfd=8)
6.3707</b>
And consider the F critical value with the exact same degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator, but with a significance level of <b>0.005</b>:
<b>scipy.stats.f.ppf(q=1-.005, dfn=6, dfd=8)
7.9512</b>
<em>Refer to the  SciPy documentation  for the exact details of the f.ppf() function.</em>
