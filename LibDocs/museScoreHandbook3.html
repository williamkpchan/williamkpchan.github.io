<h2><span class="orange">Getting started</span></h2>
This chapter helps you to install and run MuseScore for the first time. 
It will introduce you to the various learning and help resources.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Learning MuseScore</span></h2>
<h3>Tours</h3>
When you run MuseScore for the first time, the <strong>Startup Wizard</strong> appears to help you set up some basic features of the software. 
One of these features is called <strong>Tours</strong>, and, as the name suggests, gives you a guided tour of the program.

To activate this feature, on the <strong>Tours</strong> page of the Startup Wizard, tick "Yes" in response to "Would you like to see these tours?"
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/startup_wizard_tours_en.png">

This will allow the <strong>Tour</strong> to run when the program opens, introducing you to the main features of the user interface.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-06/Continue-Tours_en.png?itok=15fOL4Mk">

<strong>To end the tour</strong>: press the <kbd><samp class="button">Close</samp></kbd> button.
<strong>To stop the Tour showing when you open MuseScore</strong>: Uncheck "Continue taking Tours".

<strong>To enable the Tour again</strong> (when program reopens): Select <samp>Help</samp>→<samp>Tours</samp>→<samp>Show Tours</samp>.
<strong>To see all the Tours again</strong> (when program reopens): Select <samp>Help</samp>→<samp>Tours</samp>→<samp>Reset Tours</samp>.
Currently offered tours:

Introduction to User Interface.
Entering notes and rests in a score.
Entering symbols from a palette.

Navigating the score with Timeline.
Navigating the score with keyboard.

<h3>Getting Started score</h3>
The interactive <strong>Getting Started</strong> score is a practical introduction to the basics of entering a score. 

When you open MuseScore for the first time, it will be displayed in the main window of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#start-center">Start Center</a>: just click to open it. 
Follow the instructions written in blue, and you will be led through the basic steps of score writing.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you don't see the Getting Started score, you can find it in the right hand panel of the Start Center. 

Click the right or left arrows to browse through the options until it appears.
<h3>Video tutorials</h3>

<h2><br><span class="orange">Get Support</span></h2>
If you experience a problem while working with MuseScore, there are several ways to get help and support.
<h3>Handbook</h3>
To access the Handbook:

From the <a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a> website: select <strong><samp>Support</samp> → <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook">Handbook</a></samp></strong> from the menu.
From the MuseScore program: select <strong><samp>Help</samp> → <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook">Online Handbook</a></samp></strong> from the menu.
You can browse through the Handbook using the menus, or do a <a href="https://musescore.org/search/handbook">search</a>.

<h3>Context help</h3>
If you select an element in your score and press <kbd><kbd>F1</kbd></kbd>, a webpage opens displaying a list of links associated with that element in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook">Handbook</a>.
<h3>Forums</h3>
MuseScore offers a number of on-line <a href="https://musescore.org/forum">Forums</a> for user collaboration. 
You may be able to find an answer here to your problem among the existing posts. 
A <a href="https://musescore.org/search/site">general search</a> of the website will return a list of relevant hits to all forums and the Handbook.

<h3>How To's</h3>
Some tasks require the use of several different techniques. 
These can be difficult to find an answer for in the Handbook. 

Solutions for these <em>may</em> be found in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/howto">How To's</a>
<h3>Post a question</h3>
If you cannot find the answer to your problem, you can ask a question in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/forum/6">Support and bug reports</a> forum.

When you post your question:
Try to be as precise as you can, when you describe what you want to do, and which steps you have already tried.
Attach the score that shows the problem. 

This will make it much easier for others to understand the problem — use the "File attachments" option at the bottom of the page, just above the <kbd><samp class="button">Save</samp></kbd> and <kbd><samp class="button">Preview</samp></kbd> buttons.
You may format the text using <a href="https://musescore.org/en/filter/tips">these tips</a>.
<h3>Report a bug</h3>
If you encounter something you think is a bug, the first step is to post it in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/forum/6">Support and bug reports</a> forum. 
This will allow others to help check if it is a genuine bug, and to advise workarounds, so you can continue your scorewriting. 
You will find more details on this in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/bug-reports-and-feature-requests">Bug reports and Feature requests</a>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Install on Windows</span></h2>
<h3>Install</h3>
If you're on Windows 10, a 32-bit version of MuseScore can be installed from the Windows Store. 

Clicking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/musescore-2/9p0cnr9rwzsx">here</a> will open MuseScore's page in the Store app. 
There you will only have to click <kbd><samp class="button">Get the app &gt;</samp></kbd> and MuseScore will be downloaded, installed and subsequently automatically updated.
Otherwise you can get the Windows installer from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/download">download</a> page of the MuseScore website. 

Click on the link to start the download (pick your choice of 64-bit or 32-bit). 
Your Internet browser will ask you to confirm that you want to download this file. 
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Save File</samp></kbd>.

When the download finishes, double-click on the file to start the installation. 
Windows may prompt you with a security window to confirm this before running the software. 
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Run</samp></kbd> to continue.


The installation process will now start
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-1.png?itok=iVs_09TG">

If you click <kbd><samp class="button">Cancel</samp></kbd>, here or later, you'll see:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-1b.png?itok=IyDXerSh">

If instead you click <kbd><samp class="button">Next</samp></kbd> to continue, the setup wizard displays the terms of the free software license.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-2.png?itok=UtRNvVqz">


Read the terms of the license, make sure the box next to "I accept the terms in the License Agreement" is checked, and click <kbd><samp class="button">Next</samp></kbd> to continue. 
Next the installer will ask you to confirm the location in which to install MuseScore.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-3.png?itok=9bITghp5">


If you are installing a newer version of MuseScore but still want to keep the old version on your computer, then you should change the folder (note that MuseScore 3 can coexist with MuseScore 2 and 1 with no changes needed). 
Otherwise click <kbd><samp class="button">Next</samp></kbd> to continue.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-4.png?itok=-9VnfX4O">


Click <kbd><samp class="button">Install</samp></kbd> to continue.
Give the setup wizard a few minutes to install the necessary files and configurations. 
You'll see

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-5.png?itok=fkToybeK">

and finally
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Win-Install-wizard-6.png?itok=lmFMeY4R">


Click <kbd><samp class="button">Finish</samp></kbd> to exit the installer. 
You may delete the installer file you downloaded.
<h4>Start MuseScore</h4>
To start MuseScore, from the menu, select <samp>Start</samp>→<samp>All Programs</samp>→<samp>MuseScore 3</samp>→<samp>MuseScore 3</samp>.
<h4>Advanced users: Silent or unattended install</h4>
You can install MuseScore silently with the following command

<code>msiexec /i MuseScore-X.Y.msi /qb-</code>
Append <code>ALLUSERS=1</code> if you want to install it for all users of the system rather than just the current one.
<h3>Uninstall</h3>
You can uninstall MuseScore from the menu by selecting <samp>Start</samp>→<samp>All Programs</samp>→<samp>MuseScore 3</samp>→<samp>Uninstall MuseScore</samp>; or via Windows' Control Panel. 
Note that this will not remove your scores, templates, extensions and plugins nor your MuseScore settings.
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
The installer might be blocked by the system. 
If you don't manage to install MuseScore, right-click the downloaded file and click Properties. 
If there is a message <em>"This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer"</em>, click on "Unblock", "OK" and double-click on the downloaded file again.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Install on macOS</span></h2>
<h3>Install</h3>
You will find the DMG (disk image) file on the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/download">download</a> page of the MuseScore website. 
Click on the macOS link to start the download. 
When the download is complete, double-click the DMG file to mount the disk image.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-03/Mac_Install_v3_1.png?itok=iGr66lzE">

Drag and drop the MuseScore icon to the Applications folder icon.
If you are not logged in as administrator, macOS may ask for a password: click <kbd><samp class="button">Authenticate</samp></kbd> and enter your password to proceed.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-03/Mac_Install_v3_2.png?itok=HS_1dio4">

When the application has finished copying, eject the disk image. 
You can now launch MuseScore from the Applications folder, Spotlight, or Launchpad.

<strong>Note</strong>: As of macOS 10.15 "Catalina", the system has to be told to permit MuseScore to be allowed to access user parts of the file system. 
The first time you use it on Catalina, it will ask you if you wish to permit it; of course, answer "yes", but if you bypass this by accident, you can set it via System Preferences &gt; Security and Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Files and Folders. 
Unlock with your Admin credentials, then navigate to MuseScore (whichever  version(s) you have and want),  add it or them to the list of apps, and select "Documents" and "Downloads" folders, or as you prefer.

<h3>Uninstall</h3>
Simply delete MuseScore from Applications folder (Admin access will be required to do that, however). 
Note that this will not remove your scores, templates, extensions and plugins nor your MuseScore settings.

<h3>Install with Apple Remote Desktop</h3>
You can deploy MuseScore to multiple computers with the "Copy" feature of ARD. 
 Since MuseScore is a self-contained application you can simply copy the application to the '/Application' folder on the target machines. 

It is also possible to install multiple versions of the application as long as their names differ.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Language, translations, and extensions</span></h2>

MuseScore works with your "System" language (the one used for most programs, and generally depending on your country and the language settings of the PC, or account).
<h3>Change language</h3>
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac:  <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>);

In the <samp>General</samp> tab, select the desired language from the drop-down list in the <samp>Language</samp> section:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/MS_prefs.PNG?itok=LIN06f6L, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/MS_prefs.PNG?itok=ES_SQ30c 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/2019-01/MS_prefs.PNG?itok=M_y5LhOm">


<h3>Resource Manager</h3>
The <strong>Resource Manager</strong> is used to install and uninstall extensions, and to handle the update of translations. 
To access the menu use one of the following options:

From the menu bar, select <samp>Help</samp>→<samp>Resource Manager</samp>.
From the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac:  <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>), open the <samp>General</samp> tab, and click on the <kbd><samp class="button">Update translations</samp></kbd> button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/MS_resources.PNG?itok=ch7ChOk6">


<h4>Install/uninstall extension</h4>
To install or uninstall an extension:
Select the <samp>Extensions</samp> tab  in the <strong>Resource Manager</strong>.

Select the extension.
Click the <kbd><samp class="button">Install</samp></kbd> or <kbd><samp class="button">Uninstall</samp></kbd> button.
<strong>Note:</strong> Extensions currently include the MuseScore Drumline (MDL) (as of version 3.0) and the MuseScore General HQ soundfont (as of version 3.1).

<h4>Update translations</h4>
To update translation(s):
Select the <samp>Languages</samp> tab in the <strong>Resource Manager</strong>.

Click on the <kbd><samp class="button">Update</samp></kbd> buttons for the language(s) you want to update.

<strong>Note</strong>: Almost all menus and dialogs will switch to the changed/updated translations immediately, but some won't use them until the program is restarted.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Checking for updates</span></h2>

<strong>Note:</strong> These options are only available in the Mac and Windows versions of MuseScore (except the version from the Windows Store), as only those can be updated directly from MuseScore.org. 
Linux distributions (and the Windows Store) have different mechanisms to make updates available.
For the versions of MuseScore that can be directly updated, there are two ways to check for updates.

<h3>Automated update check</h3>
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac:  <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>);
Select the <samp>Update</samp> tab.

Ensure the box marked "Check for new version of MuseScore" is ticked. 
(It should be ticked by default):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-02/MS_prefs_update.PNG?itok=NvzaZmvg">



If you enable this option, MuseScore will check for updates on every start. 
On the Mac and Windows versions (excluding the Windows Store version), this option enables an auto-updater that will download and install updates automatically.
<h3>Check for update</h3>
From the menu, select <samp>Help</samp>→<samp>Check for Update</samp>:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/MS_check_update_en.png?itok=LC5l0bL-">

A dialog will appear with the update status: either "No Update Available" or "An update for MuseScore is available:" followed by a link to download it.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Basics</span></h2>
The previous →"<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/getting-started">Getting started</a>" chapter guided you through the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/installation">installation</a> process.


This chapter shows you how to set up a new score using the MuseScore Wizard, and how to enter and edit basic music notation. 
The various parts of the program window are described—toolbars, Inspector, palettes etc.—as well as viewing and navigation options.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Installation</span></h2>
MuseScore exists for various different operating systems, including Windows and macOS, as well as many <a href="https://musescore.org/en/download#Linux">Linux distributions</a> and several <a href="https://musescore.org/en/download#*BSD">BSD variants</a>. 
All are available from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/download">MuseScore download</a> page.

Use keyboard shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd>);
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp>→<samp>New...</samp>.
<h4>Enter score information</h4>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Create_new_score-Title_en_1.png?itok=sOVmwGVM">


<em>Step 1: Enter score information.</em>
Enter the title, composer or any other information as shown above, then click on <kbd><samp class="button">Next &gt;</samp></kbd>. 

This step is optional: you can also add this information after the score has been created (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#vertical">Vertical frame</a>).
<h4>Choose template file</h4>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Create_new_score-Select_template_en.png?itok=pSS6lqLG">

<em>Step 2: Choose template file.</em>

In the left column is a list of solo, ensemble and orchestral <em>templates</em>, divided into categories according to musical styles. 
If you have previously stored any custom <a href="#templates">templates</a> in your <a href="#user-templates-folder">user templates folder</a>, these are displayed under the heading, "<strong>Custom Templates</strong>". 
You can also use the <strong>Search bar</strong> (top left) to find specific templates.

<strong>To choose a score template</strong>:
Click on the name of a score template to select it, then click <kbd><samp class="button">Next &gt;</samp></kbd>; alternatively, just double-click the score template name. 
This will automatically take you to the next page of the Wizard (see <a href="#key-signature-and-tempo">Choose key signature and tempo</a>, below).

If you wish to create a score template from scratch, click on "<a href="#instruments-and-voice-parts">Choose Instruments</a>" (under "General"), then click <kbd><samp class="button">Next &gt;</samp></kbd>; alternatively, just double-click "Choose instruments."
<h4>Choose instruments (or voice parts)</h4>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Create_new_score-Add-instruments_en_2.png?itok=SBGbcVyB">


The <strong>Choose Instruments</strong> window is divided into two columns:
The <strong>left column</strong> contains a list of instruments or voice parts to choose from. 
This list is categorized into instrument families and clicking a category shows the full list of instruments in each family.

The default entry is "Common instruments" but you can choose from others as well, including "Jazz instruments" and "Early music". 
There is a search box at the bottom of the instrument window: typing the name of an instrument there will search for it in "All instruments".
The <strong>right column</strong> starts off empty, but will eventually contain a list of instruments for your new score in the order that they will appear.

<h5>Add instruments</h5>
To add instruments to the score, use any of the following options:
Select one or more instruments in the left column and click <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd>.

Double-click an instrument in the left column.
The instrument names, and their associated staff lines, now appear in the list of instruments in the right column. 
You can add more instruments or voice parts, as needed. 

Each instrument added in this way is allocated its own <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a> channel.
Once an instrument track is added to your score, you can edit its sound features by using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer#track-area">Mixer's track area</a>. 
You will find a vertical panel in the Mixer menu for that new instrument in the lower half of the panel, next to the volume (master Gain) slider. 

All instruments in the score will have their own panel, with their names at the bottom of the panel. 
 If you can't see the names, drag the vertical scroll bar downward until the instrument track labels are visible. 
Then just click on a panel, and edit the volume, name, instrument choice, chorus, reverb, etc. 

The changes will take effect immediately"
<strong>Note</strong>: If you want staves to share the same instrument, use the <a href="#add-staff">Add staff</a> or <a href="#add-staff">Add linked staff</a> commands instead (see below).
<h5>Add Staff / Add Linked Staff</h5>
To add a staff to an <em>existing</em> instrument in the score:
Select a <strong>staff</strong> of the instrument in the score list on the right-hand side (e.g. 
see "Staff 1" in the image below). 

Click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Staff</samp></kbd> or <kbd><samp class="button">Add Linked Staff</samp></kbd>.

To adjust the distance between staves and systems, set page margins etc., see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting">Layout and formatting</a>.
<h3>Templates</h3>
A <strong>Template</strong> is simply a standard MuseScore file that has been stored in one of two "templates" folders: any files in these folders are automatically displayed on the "<a href="#choose-template">Choose template file</a>" page of the New Score Wizard. 
Two templates folders are created by default:
A <a href="#system-templates-folder">system templates folder</a>.

A <a href="#user-templates-folder">user templates folder</a>.
<h4>System templates folder</h4>
This folder contains the templates installed with MuseScore and should <strong>not</strong> be modified. 

It can be found in the following locations:
<strong>Windows</strong>: Usually at <code>C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\templates</code> or <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\MuseScore 3\templates</code> (Actually <code>%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\templates</code> or <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\templates</code>, respectively) .
<strong>Linux</strong>: Under <code>/usr/share/mscore-xxx</code> if you installed from the package manager. 

If you compiled MuseScore on Linux yourself, then look under <code>/usr/local/share/mscore-xxx</code> (with <code>xxx</code> being the version you are using).
<strong>MacOS</strong>: Under <code>/Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/Resources/templates</code>.
<h4>User templates folder</h4>
Any templates that you create for future use should be stored here. 
Once in the user "templates" folder, they will automatically appear on the  "<a href="#choose-template">Choose template file</a>" page of the New Score Wizard—under the heading "Custom Templates".
The default location of the user templates folder is as follows:

<strong>Windows</strong>: <code>%HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Templates</code>.
<strong>MacOS</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>: <code>~/Documents/MuseScore3/Templates</code>.
To configure the location of your private templates folder:

From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#general">General</a></samp>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Note input</span></h2>
MuseScore allows you to enter music notation from <em>any</em> of four <a href="#input-devices">input devices</a>: computer keyboard, mouse, MIDI keyboard, or virtual piano keyboard. 

The default <a href="#note-input-modes">input mode</a> is <strong>step-time</strong>, in which notes or rests are entered one at a  time. 
However, other <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">input modes</a> are also available.
After exiting the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a>,  your new score will consist of a series of measures filled with measure rests:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-01/empty%20score.png?itok=ftnzq44o, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-01/empty%20score.png?itok=ysqR75Vv 2x">

Notes of different durations on the same beat are entered by using <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voices</a>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-09/voices-example_0.png?itok=UE5jCh8p">

<h3>Basic note entry</h3>
This section introduces you to the basics of entering notes and rests in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#step-time">step-time</a> from a <em>computer keyboard</em>. 
It is also recommended that you work through the tutorial, "Getting Started: An introduction to note entry in MuseScore". 
This is available from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#start-center">Start Center</a>.

<h4>Step 1. Select a starting position</h4>
Select a starting position for note input by clicking on a note or rest, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">selecting a measure</a>, with the mouse. 

If you don't select a starting point, the cursor automatically defaults to the beginning of the score when you enter <strong>Note Input</strong> mode ("Step 2" <a href="#note-input-mode">below</a>).
<h4>Step 2. Enter Note Input mode</h4>
To enter <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, use either of the following options:
Click on the "N" icon (on the extreme left of the <strong>Note Input</strong> toolbar).
Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd> on your computer keyboard.

To exit <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, use any of the following options:
Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>.
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.

Click on the toolbar "N" button.
<h4>Step 3. Select a duration</h4>
Still in <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, select a note duration using either of the following:
Click on a corresponding note icon in the <strong>Note Input toolbar</strong> (directly above the document window):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-12/note_duration_toolbar.png?itok=Im04GlDv">


Enter the keyboard shortcut for that duration (see <a href="#note-rest-duration">below</a>).
<h4>Step 4. Enter the note or rest</h4>
To enter a note pitch from A–G, simply press the corresponding letter on your computer keyboard or place it using your mouse/touchpad (and a 'normal' left-click).
To enter a rest, press 0 (zero) or right-click your mouse.
This method of entry also works if you are <em>not</em> in Note Input mode—as long as you have a note/rest selected, or the score is newly-created (in which case note entry will default to the beginning).

<h3>Select a note/rest duration</h3>
The following keyboard shortcuts are used to select note/rest duration in <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode:
<strong>64th</strong> (hemidemisemiquaver): <kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd>

<strong>32nd</strong> (demisemiquaver): <kbd><kbd>2</kbd></kbd>
<strong>16th</strong> (semiquaver): <kbd><kbd>3</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Eighth</strong> (quaver): <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd>

<strong>Quarter</strong> (crotchet): <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Half</strong> (minim): <kbd><kbd>6</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Whole</strong> (semibreve): <kbd><kbd>7</kbd></kbd>

<strong>Double whole</strong> (breve): <kbd><kbd>8</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Longa</strong>: <kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Dot</strong>: <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> (changes the selection into a dotted note/rest)

See also: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tuplets">Tuplets</a>.
<h4>Additional durations</h4>
<strong>Double</strong>, <strong>triple</strong> and <strong>quadruple dots</strong>: Apply from the note input toolbar in the advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a> or via a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcut</a>.

<strong>128th</strong> note (quasihemidemisemiquaver): Ditto.
<strong>256th</strong>, <strong>512th</strong> or <strong>1024th</strong> durations: First enter a 128th note (or longer), then half it as many times as needed using the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Q</kbd></kbd> or, as or 3.5, via a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcut</a>, or via the corresponding entries on the note input toolbar in a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces#create-custom-workspace">workspace</a>.
<h3>Input devices</h3>
Music notation can be entered by:
<a href="#keyboard">Computer keyboard</a>.
<a href="#mouse">Mouse</a>.
<a href="#midi-keyboard">MIDI keyboard</a>.
<a href="#virtual-piano-keyboard">Virtual Piano Keyboard</a>.
Any combination of the above.

<h4>Computer keyboard</h4>
This section expands on "<a href="#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a>" (see above) and introduces you to the full range of commands available for entering notes or rests from the computer keyboard.
<h5>Enter notes/rests</h5>
You can enter a <strong>note</strong> by typing the corresponding letter on your keyboard. 
Thus, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode,  type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>B</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/noteentry1_1.png?itok=KdWuPbtQ">


<strong>Note</strong>: When you enter a note using the keyboard, MuseScore places it closest to the previous note entered (above or below).
To enter a <strong>rest</strong>, type "0" (zero). 
Thus, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode, type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry2_1.png?itok=cgLP2mau">
<strong>Note</strong>: The duration selected in the toolbar applies to both notes <em>and</em> rests.
If you want to enter  a <strong>dotted note</strong>, press <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> (period/full stop) after selecting the duration.
For example, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode, type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry4_1.png?itok=RdORVJwi">

If you want to enter a tuplet (such as a triplet): see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tuplets">Tuplets</a>.
If you want to write music with two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody on the same staff, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voices</a>.

<h5>Move notes up/down</h5>
To move a note up or down by a semitone:
Press the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>  or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> arrow.

To move a note up or down diatonically:
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>.
To move a note up or down by one octave:

Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>) or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>).
<h5>Add accidentals</h5>
When a note is moved up or down with an arrow key (see above), any accidental required is automatically generated by the program. 

Accidentals can also be added manually—see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals">Accidentals</a>.
<h5>Chords</h5>
If you want to add a chord note to your previous entry:

Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then enter a note from <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>.
Thus, typing <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> results in:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry3_1.png?itok=te1htZrs">


To add a note at a specific <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#interval">interval</a> above or below one or more notes:
Ensure that one or more notes are <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">selected</a>;
Use one of the following options:

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Intervals</samp> and choose an interval from the list;
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd></kbd> for intervals <em>above</em> (intervals <em>below</em> are also possible by adding relevant <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcuts</a> to the list in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences">Preferences</a>).


<strong>Note</strong>: To create chords with notes of different durations, you will need to use more than one <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voice</a>.
<h5>Insert notes</h5>
Normally, when you enter music in MuseScore, any existing notes or rests are overwritten. 

There are, however, several ways to <em>insert</em> notes:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#insert">Insert extra measures</a> into the score.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">Cut and paste</a> a section of the score forward, then enter music into the gap.

To insert a note, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>) + the note name (<kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>). 
This will insert a note of the selected duration and move the rest of the notes to the right in the same measure. 
If the measure exceeds the duration of the time signature, the blue plus will appear above the measure as in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#timewise">Insert Mode</a>.

<h5>Delete notes</h5>
<strong>To delete a single note</strong>:
Select the note and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>).

<strong>To delete a chord</strong>:
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to ensure that you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>.
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and click on a note to select the chord.

Press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>).

The delete command can also be applied to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">range</a> of notes/chords.

<h5>Keyboard shortcuts</h5>
Here is a list of useful editing shortcuts available in Note Input mode:
<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Up): Increase the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ).

<kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Down): Decrease the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ).
<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd></kbd>: Add interval (unison to ninth) above current note.
<kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd>: Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent (e.g.

<h4>Mouse</h4>
It's easy to enter notes with the mouse, but it is not the fastest way to enter lots of notes.

Click on the desired note duration symbol in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note input toolbar</a>.
Click on the score to add a pitch of the selected duration.
To <em>add</em> more notes to an existing chord, simply repeat step 2.

To <em>replace</em> an existing chord (rather than adding to it), press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> before clicking.
To add a rest, right-click.


<strong>Note</strong>: If you hover the cursor over the score in Note Input Mode it will show you a preview of the note or rest you are about to add.
<h4>MIDI keyboard</h4>
You can also insert pitches using a MIDI keyboard.

Connect your MIDI keyboard to the computer and switch the former on
Start MuseScore (this must be done <strong>after</strong> the keyboard is switched on)
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score">Create a new score</a>

Click the rest (selecting it) in measure 1 to indicate where you want note input to begin
Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd> to enter <code>note input mode</code>
Select a note duration such as <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> for quarter notes (crotchets), as described <a href="#duration">above</a>

Press a note on your MIDI keyboard.

The pitch should be added to your score. 

 If the pitch does not appear, either use the toolbar and click 'Toggle MIDI Input' or follow these steps:
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>).
Click on the <kbd><samp>Note Input</samp></kbd> tab and check "Enable MIDI Input".

Click <kbd><kbd>OK</kbd></kbd> to exit. 
You will need to restart MuseScore to apply the change.
<strong>Note</strong>: The default method of entry, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#step-time">Step-time</a> allows you to enter one note at a time. 

Other note input modes are also available: see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">Note input modes</a>.
If you have multiple MIDI devices connected to your computer, you may need to inform MuseScore which is the MIDI keyboard:
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>).

Click on the <kbd><samp>I/O</samp></kbd> tab and select your device under the section labeled "MIDI input".
Click <kbd><kbd>OK</kbd></kbd> to exit. 
You will need to restart MuseScore to apply the change.

<h4>Virtual Piano Keyboard</h4>
You can also input notes using the on-screen <strong>piano keyboard</strong>.
<strong>To toggle the display on and off</strong>: Press <kbd><kbd>P</kbd></kbd> (or select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Piano</samp>).

<strong>To resize the keyboard</strong>: Position the mouse pointer over the piano keys, hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and move the mouse scroll wheel up (larger) or down (smaller).
The method of note entry is similar to that for a <a href="#midi-keyboard">midi keyboard</a>:
Ensure that you are in <samp><a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input mode</a></samp>.

To enter a:
<strong>Single note</strong>: Click on the appropriate piano key.
<strong>Chord</strong>: Select the note you wish to add to, press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then click on a piano key (in versions before 2.1, use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>). 

Repeat as required.
<h3>Note input modes</h3>
MuseScore offers a variety of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">note input modes</a> in addition to  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#steptime">Step-time</a>. 

All can be accessed by clicking the small  arrow next to the "N" button on the left of the Note Input toolbar:

<h3>Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range</h3>
Depending on the skill of the musician, certain notes are considered beyond the range of a particular instrument. 
For informational purposes, MuseScore <em>optionally</em> colors notes red if they are outside the range of a "professional" player, and olive green/dark yellow if outside the range of an "early amateur." The colors appear on the computer screen, but not on printed copies.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/out-of-range.png?itok=I69kpBS2">


To enable/disable note coloration and to set "professional" and "amateur" ranges, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Usable pitch range</a>  (Staff properties: all staves).
<h3>Small notes/small noteheads</h3>
Select the note(s) you want in small size.

Check the "Small" checkbox in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
The one in the <code>Note</code> section is used to only change the size of the individual notehead; the one in the <code>Chord</code> section will change the note head, stem, beam, and flag sizes all together.


By default, the small size is 70% of the normal size. 
You can change that setting in <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style…</samp>→<samp>Sizes</samp>.
<h3>Change notes or rests already entered</h3>
<h4>Change duration</h4>
<strong>Version 3.3.3 and above</strong>

1. 

Make sure you are in <samp>Normal mode</samp>.

2. 
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more notes/rests, or note-stems/hooks. 

Apply the desired duration shortcut (listed <a href="#duration">above</a>), or click on the equivalent duration icon in the toolbar.
<strong>Prior to version 3.3.3</strong>

1. 

Make sure you are in <samp>Normal mode</samp>.

2. 
Click on a note or rest. 

Apply the desired duration shortcut (listed <a href="#duration">above</a>), or click on the equivalent duration icon in the toolbar.
<strong>Note</strong>: Increasing the duration will overwrite the notes or rests that follow it; decreasing the duration will add rests between it and the notes or rests following.
For example, to change three sixteenth rests into a single dotted eighth rest:

Click on the first sixteenth rest.
Hit <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd> to turn it into an eighth rest.
Hit <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> to turn it into a dotted eighth rest.


As the duration increases, it overwrites the other two sixteenth rests following it.
<h4>Change pitch</h4>
To change the pitch of a single note:
Make sure that you're not in <samp>note input mode</samp> and that you have no other notes selected.
Select the desired note and use any of the following methods:

Drag the notehead up or down with the mouse;
Press the keyboard arrows: <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Up) or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (down);
Type a new note letter name (A…G). 

Use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> to correct the octave, if necessary (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>). 
This will automatically turn on note input mode.


To change the enharmonic spelling of a note, select it and use the <kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd> command. 
For more information, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals">Accidentals</a>.
To change the pitches of a passage of music by a constant interval, you can use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition">Transposition</a>.

To change the pitches of a passage of music to a different melody, while keeping the rhythm unchanged, use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#repitch">Re-pitch mode</a>.
If your score contains a lot of misspelled accidentals, you might try the Respell Pitches command (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#respell-pitches">Accidentals: Respell pitches</a>).
<h4>Change voice</h4>
To change one or more notes to a different voice, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voices</a>.
<h4>Change rest to note and vice versa</h4>
To change a rest to a note of the same duration:

Make sure you are not in <samp>note input mode</samp> (press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to exit).
Select the rest.
Enter the desired pitch by entering a note letter, <kbd><kbd>A–G</kbd></kbd>.

To change a note to a rest of the same duration:

<h2><br><span class="orange">Edit mode</span></h2>
<strong>Edit mode</strong> allows you to perform a wide range of editing operations on individual score elements, such as:
Adjust the length and shape of slurs, lines, barlines etc.

Add, delete and format text in text objects.
Adjust the position of <em>most</em> score elements (but not <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-basics#adjust-text-position">text</a>).
<h3>Enter edit mode</h3>
<h4>MuseScore versions 3.4 and above</h4>
For lines, hairpins, slurs, note-stems, note-beams, and barlines, use one of the following methods:
Click on an element.

Right-click on an element and, from the menu, select <samp>Edit Element</samp>.
For other elements, use one of the following methods:

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#change-length">Lines: Change length</a>, and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs#adjustments">Adjust slur</a>.
<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Offset notes</h4>
Sometimes it is necessary to shift a note to the right or left—to avoid a collision with another element or to override automatic <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/noteheads#shared-noteheads">notehead sharing</a> for example:
Enter <a href="#enter-edit-mode">Edit mode</a> on the desired note;
Press the arrow key in the direction (left or right) that you wish to nudge the note  (or use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> for larger adjustments);

Press the <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> key. 
This will allow the note stem to be redrawn.
Alternatively, you can select the notehead and change the "Horizontal offset" (under "Chord") in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

<h4>Adjust note stem length</h4>
Enter <a href="#enter-edit-mode">Edit mode</a> on the desired note stem;
Use <a href="#keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a> (below) to extend or shorten the stem;

Exit edit mode.

Alternatively, you can select the stem and change the "Length Offset" (under "Stem") in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

To <em>reposition</em> a note stem, you should select it and adjust the "X" or "Y" setting for the "Offset" under "Automatic placement" in the "Element" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#inspector">Inspector</a>.
<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
In <strong>Edit mode</strong> the following keyboard commands can be used to change the position of either (1) a <strong>score element</strong> (e.g. 

ornament, accidental etc.) or (2) an <strong>adjustment handle</strong> (e.g. 
slur, line etc.):
<kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd>: Move left 0.1 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">staff space</a>.

<kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd>: Move right 0.1 staff space
<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>: Move up 0.1 staff space
<kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>: Move down 0.1 staff space

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd>): Move left one staff space

<h2><br><span class="orange">Palettes</span></h2>
A <strong>Palette</strong> is a folder containing musical symbols which can be applied to the score. 
Musescore's default palettes contain collections of related symbols, but you can customize palettes to display almost any kind of symbol, line or text. 

Palettes form the main part of a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-02/Palette_en.png?itok=laQPjYJn">

Musescore comes with two sets of <em>preset</em> palettes: a <strong>Basic</strong> and an <strong>Advanced</strong> set (contained in similarly-named <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>). 

But that is only the start. 
You can add your own symbols and text either to the existing palettes or to palettes you create in new workspaces. 
In other words, <em>you can customize each workspace to exactly meet your particular scoring needs</em>. 

See <a href="#custom-palettes">Customize palettes</a>.
<h3>View or hide the Palette area</h3>
The default position of the Palette area is to the left of the document window. 

 To view or hide it:
From the menu, select <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Palettes</samp>, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>.
To undock the Palette area:

Click the double-chevron symbol (circled in the image above), or double-click the top bar of the panel.
To re-attach the panel, double-click on the top bar again. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#side-panels">Side panels</a> for more information.

<h3>Open/close a palette</h3>
Click on the arrow next to the palette name, or double-click the palette name (in versions prior to MuseScore 3.3, click <em>once</em> on either the arrow or the palette name).
Symbols assigned to the palette are shown in a grid below the palette name. 

If you have customized one of Musescore's default palettes, clicking <strong>More</strong> will show any symbols you have deleted.
<h4>Single Palette mode</h4>
If you only want one palette open at a time, right-click at the top of the workspace (<kbd><samp class="button">...</samp></kbd>) and check the <samp>Single Palette</samp> box. 

Any opened palette will now close when you open a different one.
<h3>Apply symbols from a palette</h3>
<em>Versions 3.4 or above</em>

Select one or more score elements, then click the desired palette symbol. 
Or, drag and drop the symbol onto the desired score element in the staff.
<em>Versions prior to 3.4</em>

Select one or more score elements, then <em>double-click</em> the desired palette symbol. 
Or, drag and drop the symbol onto the desired score element in the staff.
If you are dragging a symbol to the score and decide you don't want to apply it, press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.

<em>Tip</em>: To prevent accidental rearrangement of contents during use, right-click a palette name and uncheck <samp>Enable Editing</samp>.
You can search for symbols or palette names by typing in the <strong>Search</strong> box at the top of the list. 
As you type, symbols and/or palettes with names matching your keystrokes are displayed below, updating continuously as your typed input changes. 

Displayed symbols can come from any palette, which makes this a powerful way to locate symbols without visually searching through various palettes .
Symbols can be applied directly from the search results as described above.
To restore the list of palette names, which is temporarily hidden by the search results, click <strong>X</strong> in the search box.

Anything added to the score from a palette can be copied, pasted, and duplicated: see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">Copy and paste</a>.
<h3>Customize the palette list</h3>
<h4>Change the order of palette names in the list</h4>
Drag the name of a palette up or down to any desired position.
<h4>Create a new palette</h4>
At the top of the palette list, click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Palettes</samp></kbd>→<kbd><samp class="button">Create custom palette</samp></kbd>. 

Or, right-click anywhere on the list of palette names and choose <samp>Insert New Palette</samp>.
Type the name of the new palette in the <strong>Create Palette</strong> dialog.


See <a href="#custom-palettes">Customize palettes</a> to learn how to add symbols to the new palette.
<h4>Hide a palette from the list</h4>
Hiding a palette depends on whether it is one of Musescore's default palettes or one you created yourself using the method above.

To hide a Musescore default palette:
Right-click the name of the palette you want to hide and click <samp>Hide Palette</samp>.
To hide a palette you created:

Right-click the name of the palette you want to hide, click <samp>Hide/Delete Palette</samp>, then click <kbd><samp class="button">Hide</samp></kbd> in the dialog.
<h4>Show a hidden palette in the list</h4>
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Palettes</samp></kbd> at the top of the palette list and click <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd> beside the palette name.

<h4>Delete a palette</h4>
Only palettes you created yourself can be deleted.
Right-click the name of the palette you want to delete, click <samp>Hide/Delete Palette</samp>, then click <kbd><samp class="button">Delete permanently</samp></kbd> in the dialog.

You cannot delete Musescore's default palettes. 
 If you don't intend to use a default palette, hide its name from the list instead.
<h3>Customize palettes</h3>
You can modify any Musescore default or user-created palette. 
Symbols may be added or deleted and layouts can be rearranged.
From MuseScore 3.3 onwards, all preset palettes in the Basic and Advanced workspaces can be customized directly (if you are using a previous version you will need to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces#create-new-workspace">create a new workspace</a> first).

Before customizing a palette:
Right-click on the palette name and make sure that <samp>Enable Editing</samp> is checked. 
It is automatically checked for new palettes you create yourself.

 Use <kbd><samp class="button">&lt;</samp></kbd> and <kbd><samp class="button">&gt;</samp></kbd> to step through the palettes in the list.
<h3>Palette menu</h3>
The following menu appears either by right-clicking the name of a palette or by clicking the <strong>...</strong> to the right of the name:

<samp>Hide Palette</samp>: Removes the name of the palette from the list of available palettes.
<samp>Hide/Delete Palette</samp>: Allows you to either hide or permanently delete a palette you created yourself. 
 Shown in place of the above menu item.

<samp>Insert New Palette</samp>: Creates a new empty palette.

<em>Element Offset</em>: Adjusts the vertical offset of all symbols in the palette.
<em>Scale</em>: Makes all symbols in the palette appear larger or smaller.

<em>Show grid</em>: Draws a border around each palette cell.
<h3>Behavior of applied text and lines</h3>
If the symbol you are adding to the score from a palette contains a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> element (e.g. 

staff text, dynamic, fingering, volta etc.), then properties such as font type, font size, text color and alignment will adapt according to the following rules:
Text properties which have not been altered by the user will adopt the relevant <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">text styles</a>.
Custom text properties—those changed by the user before saving the symbol to a custom palette—remain as customized.


By contrast, the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#custom-lines">line properties</a> of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">lines</a> applied from a palette <em>always</em> remain unchanged (i.e. 
as set by the user before saving to a custom workspace, or as predefined in the Basic/Advanced workspaces).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Workspaces</span></h2>
The  <strong>workspace</strong> consists of several components, the main one being the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> area situated to the left of the document window.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/workspace_en_1.png?itok=XjjpR4ZN">
Each <strong>palette</strong> is a folder containing musical symbols (usually related) which can be applied to the score.

<strong>To open or close a palette</strong>: Click on the arrow next to the palette name, or double-click the palette name  (in versions prior to MuseScore 3.3, click <em>once</em> on either the arrow or the palette name).
<strong>To view or hide the palette area of the workspace</strong>:
Press, <kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>; alternatively, from the menu, select <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Palettes</samp>.

MuseScore provides two preset workspaces: <strong>Basic</strong> (the default option) and <strong>Advanced</strong> (a version with more palettes and symbols). 
These contain symbols drawn from the various sections of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/master-palette">Master palette</a>. 
In addition, you can create your own <a href="#create-custom-workspace">custom workspaces</a> (below).

<h3>Switch between workspaces</h3>
Use one of the following methods:
Select a new workspace from the drop-down menu to the right of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note Input Toolbar</a> (in versions prior to 3.3.

To change the overall <strong>workspace display</strong>: Select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Workspace</samp>→<samp>Edit</samp>. 
This displays a window with the same options as the <a href="#create-new-workspace">Create New Workspace</a> dialog (above).

<h3>Save custom workspace</h3>
Any changes you make to the workspaces are automatically saved to the program (no further action required). 
Each custom workspace is saved as a separate file in a folder called "workspaces." Its location is as follows:

<strong>Windows</strong>: <code>C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MuseScore\MuseScore3\</code>(actually <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\MuseScore\MuseScore3</code>)
<strong>MacOS</strong>: <code>~/Library/Application\ Support/MuseScore/MuseScore3/</code>.
<strong>Linux</strong>: <code>${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/MuseScore/MuseScore3/</code>.

<h3>What the Inspector does</h3>
When you select any object in the score window, its properties are automatically displayed in the <strong>Inspector</strong> where they can be edited. 

Multiple elements can also be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">selected</a> and edited together—as long as they are of the same type. 
However, if the selected objects are of <em>different</em> types, then the Inspector restricts you to editing color, visibility, and automatic placement only.
<h3>"Reset to style default" and "Set to style" buttons</h3>
When you select a score object, two types of buttons are clearly visible on the right-hand side of the Inspector:
<strong>Reset to style default</strong>: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/reset-to-style-button.png?itok=EeHhbC-n">


. 
Press this button to reset a particular property to the default value—i.e. 
the one shown in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style menu</a>.

<strong>Set as style</strong>: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-07/set-as-style-button.png?itok=gjFtw74C">
. 
Press this button to make the value of a particular property the new default for the style. 

This will update the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style menu</a> and all other objects governed by that style.
<strong>Note</strong>: You can also edit styles directly from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style menu</a>.
<h3>Inspector categories</h3>
Properties are conveniently listed under <strong>categories</strong> in the Inspector. 
<strong>Categories</strong> can be identified by their bold lettering. 
For example, if you select a barline, you will see the following displayed at the top of the Inspector:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/Barline%20inspector.png?itok=2DIekAfF">

A positive number moves the elements right or down; a negative number moves the elements left or up. 

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/align-elements#snap-to-grid">Snap to grid</a> buttons are also provided.
<strong>Stacking order (Z)</strong>: See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/automatic-placement#stacking-order">Automatic placement: Stacking order</a>
<h4>Element Group</h4>
This category is displayed only when you have selected a mixture of different types of elements, and allows editing of color, visibility, and automatic placement only.
<h4>Segment</h4>
<strong>Leading Space</strong>: Use this to increase or decrease the space before an element. 

This also affects any associated lyric syllables.
<h4>Chord</h4>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-10/chord_inspector_en_1.png?itok=IB1TsNUE">
<strong>Offset X</strong>/<strong>Y</strong>: This changes the positon of every note in the same voice as the selected note(s).

<strong>Small</strong>: Make noteheads and stem small.
<strong>Stemless</strong>: Make chord stemless.

<strong>Stem direction</strong>: Choice of Auto, Up, or Down.
<h4>Note</h4>
This category allows you to make changes to selected notes (but for note position—see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Element</a>). 

It contains the following properties:
<strong>Small</strong>: Make notehead smaller (you can specify the relative size of all small notes from the menu: <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style…</samp> → <samp>Sizes…</samp>).
<strong>Head group</strong>: See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/noteheads#notehead-groups">Notehead groups</a>.

<strong>Head type</strong>: See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/noteheads#change-notehead-type">Notehead types</a>.
<strong>Mirror head</strong>: Position notehead to the left or right of the stem (default is "Auto").
<strong>Fix to line</strong>: When ticked, the note is fixed to the top line of the standard 5-line staff.

<strong>Line</strong>: A positive number moves the "fixed" note down; a negative number moves it upwards.
<strong>Play</strong>: Unticking this box silences the note.
<strong>Tuning</strong>: Adjust tuning of note to the nearest <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#cent">cent</a>.

<strong>Velocity type</strong>: Sets the MIDI velocity of notes directly. 
Choose one of two options:
<strong>Offset</strong>: Make the value shown in "Velocity" <em>relative</em> to the previous dynamic marking.

<strong>User</strong>: Make the value shown in "Velocity" <em>absolute</em> (i.e. 
the MIDI velocity is <em>unaffected</em> by dynamic markings).
<strong>Velocity</strong>: Set the MIDI velocity according to the option displayed in "Velocity type."

<h4>Select</h4>
This category appears differently according to the selection you have made:
<em>If you select a notehead</em>, the "Select" category displays buttons which allow you to easily switch the selection to the stem, beam, hook, duration dot (or dots) or tuplet number associated with the notehead (see image below).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/inspector_select.png?itok=p2bSiETl">

buttons, at the bottom left of the dialog, to navigate to the previous or next measure.
<h4>Staves</h4>
<strong>Visible</strong>:  Check/uncheck to show/hide notes and staff lines for the selected measure.
<strong>Stemless</strong>: Check/Uncheck to show/hide all note stems for the selected measure.
<h4>Measure duration</h4>
This section of the dialog allows you to adjust the duration of a single measure independently of the displayed time signature.

<strong>Nominal</strong> is the <em>apparent</em> time signature and cannot be edited.
<strong>Actual</strong> can be set to anything you like regardless of the <em>nominal</em> time signature.
<strong>Example</strong>: In the image below, the quarter note <em>pickup measure</em> has a <em>nominal</em> time signature of 4/4, but an <em>actual</em> time sig. 

of 1/4. 
The measures in the middle are in normal 4/4 time. 
The complementary measure at the end of the staff, with a dotted half note, has an <em>actual</em> time sig. 

of 3/4.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Incomplete-Measures.png?itok=LcLwdg0U">

<strong>Note</strong>: A small <kbd><kbd>-</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd> sign appears above the measure when its duration is different than indicated by the time signature (see image below). 

<em>This does not appear in any printed or PDF copy</em>. 
You can turn off these marks by unchecking "Mark Irregular Measures" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#view-menu">View menu</a>.

Pressing Ctrl+Del on a note or pause also reduces the duration of the measure, while via <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">insert mode</a> you can increase the duration of the measure.

<h4>Other</h4>
<h5>Exclude from measure count</h5>
<strong>Exclude from measure count</strong>: Tick to exclude the selected measure from measure numbering (e.g. 

a pickup measure).
<h5>Break multimeasure rests</h5>
<strong>Break multimeasure rests</strong>: Tick to prevent a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-rests">multimeasure rest</a> at the start of the selected measure. 

This option should be checked <em>before</em> turning on <em>"Create multimeasure rests"</em> in <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp>Score</samp>. 
The default program setting for scores is <em>OFF</em>; for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">parts</a> is <em>ON</em>.
<em>Note</em>: Multimeasure rests are broken, by default, at important breaks—such as rehearsal marks, time signature changes, double barlines, <a href="#other">irregular measures</a>, etc.

<h5>Measure number mode</h5>
This allows you to control whether and how measure numbers display on the selected measure:
<strong>Auto</strong>: Follows the setting in <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp>Measure Numbers</samp>.

<strong>Always Show</strong>: Forces display of number.
<strong>Always Hide</strong>: Hides number.
<h5>Layout stretch</h5>
<strong>Layout stretch</strong>: Controls the amount of horizontal space between score elements (notes, rests, etc.).
This setting allows a more precise degree of control than offered by the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#layout-stretch">Increase/Decrease Stretch</a> (<kbd><kbd>{</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>}</kbd></kbd>) commands.
<h5>Add to measure number</h5>
<strong>Add to measure number"</strong>: Enter a positive or negative number to change the number of the selected measure, and subsequent meaures. 
 A value of "-1" has the same effect as marking a measure to be excluded from measure count.
<h5>Play Count</h5>
<strong>Play count</strong>: If a measure precedes an end repeat barline, this value controls the number of times that the entire repeat section plays back: see also, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/repeats-and-jumps">Repeats and jumps</a>.
<h3>Numbering</h3>
By default, MuseScore numbers the first measure of each System (except for the first measure in a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section</a>), but other numbering options are available: see  <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-measure-numbers">Measure Numbers</a></samp>.

<h3>Split and join</h3>
To make a measure longer or shorter in duration—without changing the time signature—you can adjust its <a href="#properties">Measure Properties</a> (above). 
But it is also possible to join or split measures.

<h4>Join measures</h4>
<strong>Method A</strong>. 
To join <em>two measures only</em>:

Select the barline between the two measures and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.
<strong>Method B</strong>. 
To join <em>any number of measures</em>:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the measures you want to join;
From the menu bar, select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Measure</samp>→<samp>Join Selected Measures</samp>.
<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) If you select measures on only one staff in a score with multiple staves, the same measures will be joined in each staff of the system. 

(2) Beaming may be automatically modified. 
(3) If you have generated parts already, this option is disabled.
<h4>Split a measure</h4>
Choose one of the following methods:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> a note; then hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and click a barline in a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and drag a barline (from a palette) to the note that starts the next measure.

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> a note; then, from the menu bar, select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Measure</samp>→<samp>Split Measure Before Selected Note/Rest</samp>.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you select only one note from one staff, each staff of the system will be split at the same place.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Voices</span></h2>

A <strong>voice</strong> is a musical line or part which can have its own rhythm independently of other voices on the <em>same</em> staff. 
Voices are sometimes called "layers" in other notation software.
You can have up to 4 <strong>voices</strong> on <em>each</em> staff line. 

In a polyphonic measure, <strong>voice 1</strong> (and 3) usually takes the <em>up-stem notes</em> and <strong>voice 2</strong> (and 4) takes the <em>down-stem</em> notes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-11/Voices_Diagram_en.png?itok=IgqLw7MV">

<strong>N.B.</strong> Be careful not to confuse the concept of MuseScore voices (1, 2, 3, 4) with the order of voices found in SATB vocal scores:

In <strong>Open score SATB</strong> (where four staves are used for the four voices), use (MuseScore) voice 1 in each staff.
In <strong>Close/Closed score SATB</strong> (where two staves are used for the four voices, e.g., as in hymnals), use only (MuseScore) voices 1 and 2 for both upper <em>and</em> lower staves.
There is no need to use (MuseScore) voices 3 and 4 unless there are more than two parts in the <em>same</em> <em>staff</em>. 

This means that in the bass clef of a “close score”, the tenor is voice 1 and the bass is voice 2—beginners often without thinking assign the bass to 1, resulting in stem-direction confusion, or assign tenor to voice 3 and bass to voice 4, which then leads to confusing rests appearing in voice 1 (which cannot be deleted).
<h3>How voices are displayed</h3>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Selecting</a> a section of the score highlights each voice in a different color: voice 1 blue, voice 2 green, voice 3 orange and voice 4 purple.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-03/VoicesColoured.png?itok=MqUyuL-I">
<h3>When to use voices</h3>
If you need stems pointing in opposite directions within a chord, on a single staff.
If you need notes of different durations within a single staff, played simultaneously.

<h3>How to enter notes in different voices</h3>
The following instructions show you how to notate a passage of music in two voices:
<strong>Enter voice 1 notes first</strong>: Make sure you are in <em><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">note input mode</a></em> :  the Voice 1 button becomes highlighted in blue in the toolbar. 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Button-Voice_Selector.png?itok=uC-bZYLX">

Enter the notes in the top voice first. 
On inputting, some notes may have down-stems, but these will flip automatically when the second voice is added.

The following excerpt shows a treble staff with just the voice 1 notes entered:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/voices0_0.png?itok=gWbXcg-N">

<strong>Move cursor back to start of section</strong>: When you have finished entering a section of voice 1 notes, press the <kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd> key repeatedly to move the cursor, note-by-note, back to the first note of the section; or alternatively use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> (Mac:<kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd>) to move the cursor back one measure at a time. 

Or else you can simply exit <em>note input mode</em> (press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>) and click directly on the first note.
<strong>Enter voice 2 notes</strong>: Make sure you are in note-input mode and that the voice 1 note at the beginning of the section is selected. 
Click on the "Voice 2" button 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Button-Voice_2.png?itok=KEkZ8OKH">

(on the right of the toolbar), or use the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd></kbd>). 
Enter all the lower voice notes (down-stem).

The following image shows the above example after the addition of voice 2 notes:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/voices2_1.png?itok=ADPcCDTV">

<h3>Deleting and hiding rests</h3>
All rests can be made <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">invisible</a>, if required: select the desired rest(s) and press <kbd><kbd>V</kbd></kbd>, or uncheck the "Visible" checkbox in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>. 
Rests in voices 2, 3 or 4 (but <em>not</em> voice 1) can also be <em>deleted</em> (by selecting them and pressing <kbd><kbd>Delete</kbd></kbd>) but it is not recommended: make them invisible instead.
A voice 1 rest can only be deleted by removing that part of the measure from the score as well: see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tools#timewise-delete">Remove selected range</a>; or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#delete">Delete measure(s)</a>.

<h4>Restoring deleted rests</h4>
If a rest has been deleted in voices 2-4, you will need to restore it before you can enter a note on that beat in that voice (the problem may arise, for example, in imported <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#musicxml">XML</a> or   <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#midi">MIDI</a> files). 
The easiest way to fix such a measure is to exchange that voice with voice 1 twice. 

For the exact method, see <a href="#exchange-voices">Exchange voices of notes</a> (below).
<h3>Exchange voices of notes</h3>
To swap the notes between any two voices:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">Select</a> one or more continuous measures (or a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">range</a> of notes);
From the Menu bar, select <samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Voices</samp>;
Select the option for the two voices you want to exchange.

<strong>Notes</strong>: (a) The selection can encompass content of any voice, but only two will be processed at once. 
(b) If you select a partial measure the operation will still apply to the whole measure.
<h3>Move notes to another voice (without swapping)</h3>
You can also move notes from one voice to another (without note-swapping):
Ensure you are not in <em>note input mode</em>.
Select one or more noteheads (in any voice).

Click on the destination voice in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note Input toolbar</a> or use the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1–4</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-4</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>Note</strong>: For a successful move, the following conditions need to be met:
The chord in the destination voice must be the same duration as the note to be moved there.

Alternatively, if the destination voice is occupied by a rest, it must be of sufficient duration to accommodate the moved note.
Notes should <em>not</em> be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/ties">tied</a>.
<h3>Navigate between voices</h3>
To select a note in a <em>higher</em>-numbered voice than the current one:
Use <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>, to move the selection to the bottommost note in the current voice;
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>, to move to the higher-numbered voice;

Repeat any of the above steps, as necessary, until the desired note is selected.

To select a note in a <em>lower</em>-numbered voice than the current one:

Use <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>, to move the selection to the topmost note in the current voice;
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>, to move to the lower-numbered voice.
Repeat any of the above steps, as necessary, until the desired note is selected.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Copy and paste</span></h2>
MuseScore supports standard <strong>copy</strong>, <strong>cut</strong>, <strong>paste</strong> and <strong>swap with clipboard</strong> operations. 
These commands can be applied to a range of:

<strong>Musical notes</strong>: e.g. 
to repeat a section of music, or shift a passage by a beat or a measure.
<strong>Other score elements</strong>: such as articulations, staff text, dynamics, fingering etc.

Copy/cut/paste/swap commands are accessed in three ways:
From the <strong>Edit menu</strong> (above the document window).
From the menu displayed by <strong>right-clicking</strong> on an element or range of elements.

Using one of the standard <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong>.

</table>
<strong>Note</strong>: Before carrying out a copy, cut, paste or swap procedure, you should be in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">normal mode</a>. 

Press the <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> key to exit into normal mode.
<h3>Notes</h3>
You can cut, copy, paste or swap notes as follows:

<h4>Copy or cut</h4>
<strong>To copy/cut a <em>single</em> chord</strong>
Hold down <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and click on a note in the chord.

Apply a <strong>Copy</strong> or <strong>Cut</strong> option (see <a href="#command-summary">table</a> above).

<strong>To copy/cut a <em>range</em> of chords</strong>

<kbd><samp>Click</samp></kbd> on the first note or measure that you want to select.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<samp>Click</samp></kbd> on the last note or measure that you want to select. 
A blue rectangle highlights the region you selected.

Apply a <strong>Copy</strong> or <strong>Cut</strong> option (see <a href="#command-summary">table</a> above).

<h4>Paste</h4>
<kbd><samp>Click</samp></kbd> on the note or measure where you want your pasted selection to begin.
Apply a <strong>Paste</strong> option (see <a href="#command-summary">table</a> above).


<h4>Swap with Clipboard</h4>
The <strong>swap with clipboard</strong> operation combines two commands into one: (1) First it overwrites a selected part of the score with the contents of the clipboard, just like the <em>paste</em> command; (2) Secondly, it transfers the overwritten part of the score <em>back to</em> the clipboard, just like the <em>copy</em> command.
It can be used, for example, to swap two equal-length sections of a score, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>:

Select section <strong>A</strong>, then apply the <a href="#command-summary">cut</a> command;
Clear the selection (by pressing <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> or clicking on a blank area of the document window);
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and click on a note at the start of section <strong>B</strong>. 

Or, if <strong>B</strong> begins at the start of a measure, you can also simply <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">select</a> the measure;
Apply a <strong>Swap with clipboard</strong> option (see <a href="#command-summary">table</a> above).
Section <strong>B</strong> is now in the clipboard. 

<a href="#command-summary">Paste</a> it back to the blank area of score left by step "1."

<h4>Copy pitch of a single note only</h4>
It is possible to copy the <em>pitch</em> of a note <em>only</em> (and no other properties), by clicking on the notehead and applying the standard copy and paste, or copy and swap procedure. 
The pitch of the destination note changes to match that of the copied note but the duration remains the same.
<h3>Other elements</h3>
Some elements such as staff text, dynamics, fingering, etc. 
can be cut, copied and pasted only <em>one at a time</em>. 
However, other elements support "<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#list-select">multiple-selection</a>" cut/copy/paste: such as  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/articulations-and-ornaments">articulations</a> (sforzato, staccato etc.),  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/fretboard-diagrams">fretboard diagrams</a>, and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols">chord symbols</a>.

<strong>Note</strong>: The Swap with clipboard command is only intended for use with sections of music and not other score elements.
<h4>Copy or cut</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the element (or elements).

Apply a <strong>Copy</strong> or <strong>Cut</strong> option (see <a href="#command-summary">table</a> above).

<h4>Paste</h4>
<kbd><samp>Click</samp></kbd> on the note where you want your pasted selection to begin.
Apply one of the <strong>Paste</strong> options (see <a href="#command-summary">table</a> above).


In the case of articulations, they are pasted to the destination notes in exactly the same order (continuous or intermittent) as they were in the initial selection.
<h3>Quick repeat</h3>
To quickly copy and paste a note, measure, or passage:

Select a chord, measure, or passage as described <a href="#copy-or-cut-elements">above</a>.
Press <kbd><kbd>R</kbd></kbd> .


MuseScore copies and pastes the selected notation to a point immediately after the last note in the selection. 
Any existing music in the destination range is replaced.
<h3>Duplicate</h3>
To instantaneously copy and paste a text element, line, or other object:
Hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>), click on the element and drag it anywhere in the score.
Release the mouse button, and the selected element is cloned to the new location.


<h3>Paste half/double duration (version 3.1 and above)</h3>
These commands allows you to copy/cut a section of the score, then paste it back anywhere with all the note durations either halved or doubled.

In Normal mode, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#shift-click-selection">select a range of notes</a> in the score;
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">Cut or copy</a> the range;
Select a destination note (or measure);

From the menu, select one of the following:
<samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Paste Half Duration</samp>.
<samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Paste Double Duration</samp>.


<h3>Selection filter</h3>
The <strong>Selection Filter</strong> allows you to choose <em>exactly</em> which voices and elements you want to include in your selection.

To display the Selection filter, press <kbd><kbd>F6</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd></kbd>); or from the menu, choose <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Selection Filter</samp>.
The Selection Filter appears by default below the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">Palettes</a>. 
To change the viewing location, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#side-panels">Viewing and Navigation: Side panels</a>.

<strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you want to copy measures 1 and 2 in the following passage (see image), to give measures 3 and 4:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-01/selection_filter_example.png?itok=S7asIkXD">

Make sure the Selection Filter is displayed (see above);

Uncheck the "Articulations &amp; Ornaments" and "Slurs" tickboxes;
Copy and paste the desired measures (in this example, 1-2 into 3-4).


<strong>Note</strong>: The Selection Filter works with the <a href="#swap-notes">swap with clipboard</a> command as well.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Selection modes</span></h2>
Objects in the score—such as notes, measures, articulations etc.—can be selected in several ways: (1) <a href="#select-single-object">one at a time</a>, (2) as a continuous <a href="#range-select">range</a>, or (3) as a <a href="#list-select">list</a>.

Selection is invariably used before applying commands such as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#delete-notes">delete</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">copy/cut and paste</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition">transpose</a> and so on.
<h3>Select a single object</h3>
Most score objects can be selected by simply clicking on them in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>.

<h4>Select a single note</h4>
In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>, click on a notehead.
<strong>Note</strong>: Selecting a single note then copying and pasting it, will only copy and paste the pitch—not duration or other properties (such as stemless). 

To copy the entire note, including all properties, you need to hold down <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>—as for chord selection (below).
<h4>Select a chord</h4>
In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>, press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then click on a notehead in the chord.

<h4>Select a single measure</h4>
Click on a blank space within the measure.
<strong>Note</strong>: To select a range of consecutive measures, see <a href="#shift-selection">Shift selection</a> and <a href="#shift-click-selection">Shift + click selection</a> (below).

<h3>Select an overlapping element</h3>
To select an element from a group of overlapping elements:
Hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and click until the desired element is selected.

<h3>Select a continuous range of objects</h3>
There are several ways to select a <em>continuous</em> range of notes, chords or measures etc.:
<h4>1. 

Shift + click selection</h4>
To select a range of <strong>notes</strong> or <strong>rests</strong>:
Make sure you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>;

Click on the first note or rest in the range;
Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then click on the last desired note or rest.


<strong>Note</strong>: The final selected element can be in the same staff or in staffs above or below the initial note/rest. 
All selected elements will be enclosed in a blue rectangle, including associated lines and articulations (but not voltas). 
You can repeat the operation to extend the selected range as required.

<h5>Select chord symbols, lyrics etc. 
(as of version 3.5)</h5>
As of MuseScore 3.5, the shift + click method has been refined to make it easier to select a continuous range of items such as chord symbols, lyrics etc. 

For example:
Click on the first chord symbol in the desired range.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + click on the last chord symbol in the range.


<em>Result</em> All chord symbols in that range are selected, and nothing else.
<h5>Select a range of measures</h5>
Click on a blank space in the first desired measure;

This method is used to select a <strong>section</strong>—a region of the score starting and/or ending with a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section break</a>:
Click on an empty space in a measure in the section;
From the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Select Section</samp>.


<h4>6. 
Selection Filter</h4>
The Selection Filter allows you include or exclude certain types of elements within a range selection. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste#selection-filter">Copy and paste: Selection filter</a>
<h3>Select a list of objects</h3>
To select a <em>list</em> (or discontinuous range) of score elements:
Click on the first element;
Hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and successively click on the desired additional elements.

<strong>Note</strong>: This method cannot be used to select measures. 
Use <a href="#select-measure">single</a> or <a href="#shift-click-selection">range</a> selection instead.
<h3>Modify an existing selection (as of version 3.5)</h3>
You can also use the Ctrl + click method to add to, or subtract from, an existing selection. 
For example:
Make a selection in the score using any of the methods above.

To add a non-selected element to the selection, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and click on it. 
Repeat as required.
To remove an already-selected element from the selection, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and click on it. 

Repeat as required.
<h3>Select all similar</h3>
To select all elements of a specific type (e.g., all barlines, all text elements, all staccato markings):

Click on the first object of the type of element you want to match. 
Then shift-click the last similar element you want included. 
This creates a List Selection that includes the clicked element, the shift-clicked element and all similar elements in-between. 

 <em>NOTE: If you shift-click on a dissimilar element then only that element becomes selected. 
If you use this technique on notes or rests you'll invoke a Range Selection.</em>
— OR —

Right-click on the type of element you want to match and choose <samp>Select…</samp> from the contextual menu;

Several options will appear in the submenu:
<strong>All Similar Elements</strong>


To select all similar elements in the entire score:

Right-click the element;

then choose <em>Select … All Similar Elements</em>

<strong>All Similar Elements in Same Staff</strong>

To select all similar elements within a particular staff:

Right-click the element;


then choose <em>Select …  All Similar Elements in Same Staff</em>
<strong>All Similar Elements in Range Selection</strong>:

NOTE: This only applies if a range has been selected.


Within an established range selection,

right-click the element you want to match similarly;

then choose <em>All Similar Elements in Range Selection</em>

<strong>More...</strong>: opens a dialog that lets you fine-tune more options. 
For example, if you have a notehead selected, the dialog will look something like this:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/select_notes.png?itok=KVL8h2b5">



<strong>Select</strong>
Same notehead: In this example, only noteheads of the same <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/noteheads#notehead-groups">group</a> will be selected;
Same pitch: Only noteheads of the same pitch will be selected;

Same string: (tablature only) selects fretmarks on same string.
Same type: All noteheads (of any <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/noteheads#notehead-groups">group</a>) will be selected;
Same duration: Only noteheads of same duration will be selected;

Same note name: Noteheads of that name in all octaves will be selected;
Same staff: Only noteheads on the same staff will be selected.
Same voice: Selects all notes of same voice.

In selection:
Same system:
<strong>Action</strong>

Tick/untick this option to display or hide.
<h4>Split display</h4>
It is possible to split the document display so as to view two documents at once, or to view two different parts of the same document. 
Tabs allow you to choose which document to display in each view. 
You can drag the barrier separating the two scores to adjust the amount of space in the window devoted to each:

<strong>Documents Side by Side</strong>: Divides the window vertically into two score views.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2017-12/split_display_2.png?itok=N_vTWTa_">


<h4>Visibility options</h4>
This section allows you to display or hide various non-printing elements:
<strong>Show Invisible</strong>: View/hide elements that have been made <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">invisible</a> for printing and export. 

If this option is ticked, invisible elements are shown in the score window as light gray.
<strong>Show Unprintable</strong>: View/hide <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers">breaks and spacer</a> symbols.
<strong>Show Frames</strong>: View/hide the dotted outlines of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames">frames</a>.

<strong>Show Page Margins</strong>:  View/hide <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#page-margins">Page Margins</a>.
<h4>Mark irregular measures</h4>
A dash at the top right of a measure indicates that its duration differs from that set by the time signature.

<h4>Full screen</h4>
Full Screen mode expands MuseScore to fill your screen so more content is visible.
<h3>Page/Continuous View</h3>
You can switch between different views of the score using the drop-down list in the <a href="#toolbars">toolbar</a> area:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Page%20view.png?itok=uke_gGOr">

To scroll the score:

<strong>Vertically</strong>: Move the mouse wheel up or down.
<strong>Horizontally</strong>: Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and move the mouse wheel up or down.
<h4>Page View</h4>
In <strong>Page View</strong>, the score is formatted as it will appear when printed or exported as a PDF or image file: that is, page by page, with margins. 
MuseScore applies system (line) and page <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#breaks">breaks</a> automatically, according to the settings made in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings">Page settings</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style…</a>. 
In addition, you can apply your own system (line), page or section breaks.

To choose between <strong>horizontal</strong> or <strong>vertical</strong> page scrolling, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#canvas">Preferences: Canvas (Scroll pages)</a>.
<h4>Continuous View</h4>
In <strong>Continuous View</strong>, the score is shown as one unbroken system. 

Even if the starting point is not in view,  measure numbers, instrument names, clefs, time and key signatures will always be displayed on the left of the window.
<em>Note</em>: Because the layout is simpler, MuseScore may perform faster in Continuous View than Page View.
<h4>Single Page View</h4>
In <strong>Single Page View</strong> the score is shown as a single page with a header but no margins, and with an infinite page height. 
System (line) <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#breaks">breaks</a> are added automatically, according to the settings made in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings">Page settings</a> and  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style…</a>. 
In addition, you can apply your own system (line) or section breaks.

<h3>Side panels</h3>
The <strong>workspaces</strong>, <strong>Inspector</strong> and <strong>Selection filter</strong> are conveniently displayed as <strong>side panels</strong> to the left and right of the score window. 
To undock a side panel use one of the following methods:

Drag the panel;
Click on the double chevron at the top of the panel;
Double-click in the title area at the top of the panel.

To dock a panel use one of the following procedures:
Drag the panel to the top/bottom of an existing side panel and it will stack vertically above/below that panel.
Drag the panel to the middle of an existing side panel and it will overlay that panel. 

Both panels can then be accessed by tabs.
Alternatively, double-clicking the title bar of the panel will restore it to its previously docked position.
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<h4>Commands</h4>
Various commands are available to help you navigate more easily through the score. 
These are listed under <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/keyboard-shortcuts#score-navigation">Keyboard shortcuts: Navigation</a>.

<h4>Navigator</h4>
The <strong>Navigator</strong> is an optional panel which displays page thumbnails of the score at the bottom or to the right of the document window.
To view or hide the Navigator, select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Navigator</samp>; or use a customized <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcut</a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Navigator_bar_en_0.png?itok=p3vGQAzu, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Navigator_bar_en_0.png?itok=OdzM7G3N 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/Navigator_bar_en_0.png?itok=dXfh7O5T">
The Navigator appears at the bottom of the document window if scrolling pages horizontally; or on the right  if scrolling pages vertically (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#canvas">Preferences: Canvas</a>).
The blue box represents the area of the score that is currently visible in the document window: drag the box, or click directly on the navigator panel to bring another part of the score into view. 

You can also drag the scrollbar.
<h4>Timeline</h4>
The <strong>Timeline</strong> panel provides a detailed overview of the score, with expanded possibilities for navigation and interaction.

To display the <strong>Timeline</strong>, press <kbd><kbd>F12</kbd></kbd>; or select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Timeline</samp>.
For details, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/timeline">Timeline</a>.
<h4>Find / Go to</h4>
The <strong>Find</strong> / <strong>Go to</strong> function allows you to speedily navigate to a specific measure, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/rehearsal-marks">rehearsal mark</a> or page number in the score:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>), or select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Find</samp>. 
This opens the <strong>Find</strong> (or <strong>Go to</strong>) <strong>bar</strong> at the bottom of the workspace.

Use one of the following options:
<strong>To go to a numbered measure</strong>: enter the measure number (counting every measure, starting with 1, irrespective of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#irregular">pickup measures</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section breaks</a> or manual changes to measure number offsets).
<strong>To go to a numbered page</strong>: enter the page number using the format pXX (where XX is the page number).

<strong>To go to a numerical rehearsal mark</strong>: enter the number using the format rXX (where XX is the name of the rehearsal mark).
<strong>To go to a  rehearsal mark starting with a letter</strong>: enter the name of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/rehearsal-marks">rehearsal mark</a> (the search is case insensitive).
<strong>N.B.</strong>: It is best to avoid naming rehearsal marks with the single letters "R," "r," "P", "p," or one of these letters with an integer (e.g. 

"R1" or "p3"), as this can confuse the search algorithm.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Concert pitch</span></h2>
You can choose to display the score in either <strong>written</strong> or <strong>concert</strong> (sounding) pitch. 

Written pitch displays the score as it <em>should</em> look when printed for musicians to read. 
However, during preparation you may prefer the convenience of seeing the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition#transposing-instruments">transposing instruments</a> notated <em>as they sound</em>, without transposition. 
In this case you should select the "Concert pitch" option.

To toggle the score display between <strong>written</strong> or <strong>concert</strong> pitch:
Press the <kbd><samp class="button">Concert Pitch</samp></kbd> button (located in the top right of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">toolbar</a> area). 
When this button is highlighted the score is in concert pitch.

Before printing the score, exporting it to PDF or saving it online, you should ensure that the <kbd><samp class="button">Concert Pitch</samp></kbd> button is <strong>off</strong>, and that the individual parts are correctly transposed.

If the checkbox is checked, MuseScore will render the audio of the score using the current <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer">synthesizer</a> settings and upload the audio to MuseScore.com.


<h3>Upload a score on MuseScore.com</h3>
You can also upload a score MuseScore.com itself:

Click the <a href="https://musescore.org//musescore.com/upload?utm_source=handbook">Upload link</a> on MuseScore.com.
You have the same options as with the Save Online menu.
You also have access to more information, such as <strong>Genre</strong>.


<h3>Edit a score on MuseScore.com</h3>
If you want to make changes to one of your scores on MuseScore.com, edit the MuseScore file on your own computer, save it, and then do the following:

If you originally shared the score <a href="#direct">directly from within MuseScore</a>, simply go to <samp>File</samp>→<samp>Save Online...</samp> again to update the online score.
If you originally <a href="#upload-a-score-on-musescore-com">uploaded the score</a> via the <a href="https://musescore.org//musescore.com/upload?utm_source=handbook">Upload page</a> on MuseScore.com, then you must follow these steps to update the online score:
Go to the score page on MuseScore.com.

Click the three dots menu <kbd><samp></samp></kbd> on the right and choose "Update this score".
In the form, you can upload a replacement score file as well as change the accompanying information and privacy settings.


<h4>Switch to the direct method of updating an online score</h4>
It is much more convenient to update online scores from directly within MuseScore than by updating the score manually from the score page. 
Follow these steps if you originally uploaded the score via the <a href="https://musescore.org//musescore.com/upload?utm_source=handbook">Upload page</a> and now want to switch to the direct method:

Go to the score page on MuseScore.com and copy the URL.
Open the score file on your computer with MuseScore.
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp>→<samp>Score Properties...</samp> and paste the URL into the "Source" field.


Now whenever you want to update the online score simply go to <samp>File</samp>→<samp>Save Online...</samp>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Note input</span></h2>

MuseScore allows you to enter music notation from <em>any</em> of four <a href="#input-devices">input devices</a>: computer keyboard, mouse, MIDI keyboard, or virtual piano keyboard. 
The default <a href="#note-input-modes">input mode</a> is <strong>step-time</strong>, in which notes or rests are entered one at a  time. 
However, other <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">input modes</a> are also available.

After exiting the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a>,  your new score will consist of a series of measures filled with measure rests:

<h3>Basic note entry</h3>
This section introduces you to the basics of entering notes and rests in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#step-time">step-time</a> from a <em>computer keyboard</em>. 
It is also recommended that you work through the tutorial, "Getting Started: An introduction to note entry in MuseScore". 

This is available from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#start-center">Start Center</a>.
<h4>Step 1. Select a starting position</h4>
Select a starting position for note input by clicking on a note or rest, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">selecting a measure</a>, with the mouse. 
If you don't select a starting point, the cursor automatically defaults to the beginning of the score when you enter <strong>Note Input</strong> mode ("Step 2" <a href="#note-input-mode">below</a>).
<h4>Step 2. 
Enter Note Input mode</h4>
To enter <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, use either of the following options:
Click on the "N" icon (on the extreme left of the <strong>Note Input</strong> toolbar).

Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd> on your computer keyboard.
To exit <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, use any of the following options:
Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>.

Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.
Click on the toolbar "N" button.
<h4>Step 3. 
Select a duration</h4>
Still in <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, select a note duration using either of the following:
Click on a corresponding note icon in the <strong>Note Input toolbar</strong> (directly above the document window):


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-12/note_duration_toolbar.png?itok=Im04GlDv">
Enter the keyboard shortcut for that duration (see <a href="#note-rest-duration">below</a>).
<h4>Step 4. Enter the note or rest</h4>
To enter a note pitch from A–G, simply press the corresponding letter on your computer keyboard or place it using your mouse/touchpad (and a 'normal' left-click).
To enter a rest, press 0 (zero) or right-click your mouse.
This method of entry also works if you are <em>not</em> in Note Input mode—as long as you have a note/rest selected, or the score is newly-created (in which case note entry will default to the beginning).

<h3>Select a note/rest duration</h3>
The following keyboard shortcuts are used to select note/rest duration in <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode:
<strong>64th</strong> (hemidemisemiquaver): <kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd>

<strong>32nd</strong> (demisemiquaver): <kbd><kbd>2</kbd></kbd>
<strong>16th</strong> (semiquaver): <kbd><kbd>3</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Eighth</strong> (quaver): <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd>

<strong>Quarter</strong> (crotchet): <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Half</strong> (minim): <kbd><kbd>6</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Whole</strong> (semibreve): <kbd><kbd>7</kbd></kbd>

<strong>Double whole</strong> (breve): <kbd><kbd>8</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Longa</strong>: <kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd>
<strong>Dot</strong>: <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> (changes the selection into a dotted note/rest)

See also: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tuplets">Tuplets</a>.
<h4>Additional durations</h4>
<strong>Double</strong>, <strong>triple</strong> and <strong>quadruple dots</strong>: Apply from the note input toolbar in the advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a> or via a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcut</a>.

<strong>128th</strong> note (quasihemidemisemiquaver): Ditto.
<strong>256th</strong>, <strong>512th</strong> or <strong>1024th</strong> durations: First enter a 128th note (or longer), then half it as many times as needed using the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Q</kbd></kbd> or, as or 3.5, via a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcut</a>, or via the corresponding entries on the note input toolbar in a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces#create-custom-workspace">workspace</a>.
<h3>Input devices</h3>
Music notation can be entered by:
<a href="#keyboard">Computer keyboard</a>.
<a href="#mouse">Mouse</a>.

<a href="#midi-keyboard">MIDI keyboard</a>.
<a href="#virtual-piano-keyboard">Virtual Piano Keyboard</a>.
Any combination of the above.

<h4>Computer keyboard</h4>
This section expands on "<a href="#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a>" (see above) and introduces you to the full range of commands available for entering notes or rests from the computer keyboard.
<h5>Enter notes/rests</h5>
You can enter a <strong>note</strong> by typing the corresponding letter on your keyboard. 
Thus, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode,  type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>B</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/noteentry1_1.png?itok=KdWuPbtQ">


<strong>Note</strong>: When you enter a note using the keyboard, MuseScore places it closest to the previous note entered (above or below).
To enter a <strong>rest</strong>, type "0" (zero). 
Thus, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode, type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry2_1.png?itok=cgLP2mau">
<strong>Note</strong>: The duration selected in the toolbar applies to both notes <em>and</em> rests.
If you want to enter  a <strong>dotted note</strong>, press <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> (period/full stop) after selecting the duration.
For example, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode, type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry4_1.png?itok=RdORVJwi">

If you want to enter a tuplet (such as a triplet): see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tuplets">Tuplets</a>.
If you want to write music with two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody on the same staff, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voices</a>.

<h5>Move notes up/down</h5>
To move a note up or down by a semitone:
Press the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>  or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> arrow.

To move a note up or down diatonically:
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>.
To move a note up or down by one octave:

Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>) or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>).
<h5>Add accidentals</h5>
When a note is moved up or down with an arrow key (see above), any accidental required is automatically generated by the program. 

Accidentals can also be added manually—see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals">Accidentals</a>.
<h5>Chords</h5>
If you want to add a chord note to your previous entry:

Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then enter a note from <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>.
Thus, typing <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> results in:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry3_1.png?itok=te1htZrs">
To add a note at a specific <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#interval">interval</a> above or below one or more notes:

Ensure that one or more notes are <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">selected</a>;
Use one of the following options:
From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Intervals</samp> and choose an interval from the list;

Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd></kbd> for intervals <em>above</em> (intervals <em>below</em> are also possible by adding relevant <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcuts</a> to the list in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences">Preferences</a>).

<strong>Note</strong>: To create chords with notes of different durations, you will need to use more than one <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voice</a>.

<h5>Insert notes</h5>
Normally, when you enter music in MuseScore, any existing notes or rests are overwritten. 
There are, however, several ways to <em>insert</em> notes:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#insert">Insert extra measures</a> into the score.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">Cut and paste</a> a section of the score forward, then enter music into the gap.
To insert a note, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>) + the note name (<kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>). 

This will insert a note of the selected duration and move the rest of the notes to the right in the same measure. 
If the measure exceeds the duration of the time signature, the blue plus will appear above the measure as in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#timewise">Insert Mode</a>.
<h5>Delete notes</h5>
<strong>To delete a single note</strong>:
Select the note and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>To delete a chord</strong>:

Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to ensure that you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>.
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and click on a note to select the chord.
Press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>).


The delete command can also be applied to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">range</a> of notes/chords.
<h5>Keyboard shortcuts</h5>
Here is a list of useful editing shortcuts available in Note Input mode:
<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Up): Increase the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ).
<kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Down): Decrease the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ).

<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd></kbd>: Add interval (unison to ninth) above current note.
<kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd>: Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent (e.g. 
D to E). 

This alters the spelling in both concert pitch and transposed modes. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#change-enharmonic-spelling">Accidentals</a>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd></kbd> (Mac <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd></kbd>): Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent. 

This alters the spelling only in the current mode. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#change-enharmonic-spelling">Accidentals</a>
<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>: Increase the pitch of a note using key signature

<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>: Decrease the pitch of a note using key signature
<kbd><kbd>R</kbd></kbd>: Repeat the last entered note
<kbd><kbd>Q</kbd></kbd>: Halve the duration of the last entered note

<kbd><kbd>W</kbd></kbd>: Double the duration of the last entered note
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd></kbd>: Decrease duration by a dot (for example, a dotted quarter note/crotchet becomes a quarter note/crotchet and a quarter note/crotchet becomes a dotted eighth note/quaver).
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd></kbd>: Increase duration by a dot (for example an eighth note/quaver becomes a dotted eighth note/quaver and a dotted eighth note/quaver becomes a quarter note/crotchet).

<kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>: Undo last entered note
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd>: Exchange last entered note with the note before it (repeat to keep moving note earlier)
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>: Exchange note moved with <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> with the note that follows it

<kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd>: Flip direction of note stem (can be reset to Auto position in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>)
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd></kbd>: Move note head to opposite side of stem (can be reset to Auto position in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>)
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-4</kbd></kbd>: Switch to corresponding <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a>)

<h4>Mouse</h4>
It's easy to enter notes with the mouse, but it is not the fastest way to enter lots of notes.
Click on the desired note duration symbol in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note input toolbar</a>.

Click on the score to add a pitch of the selected duration.
To <em>add</em> more notes to an existing chord, simply repeat step 2.
To <em>replace</em> an existing chord (rather than adding to it), press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> before clicking.

To add a rest, right-click.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you hover the cursor over the score in Note Input Mode it will show you a preview of the note or rest you are about to add.
<h4>MIDI keyboard</h4>
You can also insert pitches using a MIDI keyboard.
Connect your MIDI keyboard to the computer and switch the former on
Start MuseScore (this must be done <strong>after</strong> the keyboard is switched on)

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score">Create a new score</a>
Click the rest (selecting it) in measure 1 to indicate where you want note input to begin
Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd> to enter <code>note input mode</code>

<h3>Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range</h3>
Depending on the skill of the musician, certain notes are considered beyond the range of a particular instrument. 
For informational purposes, MuseScore <em>optionally</em> colors notes red if they are outside the range of a "professional" player, and olive green/dark yellow if outside the range of an "early amateur." The colors appear on the computer screen, but not on printed copies.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/out-of-range.png?itok=I69kpBS2">
To enable/disable note coloration and to set "professional" and "amateur" ranges, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Usable pitch range</a>  (Staff properties: all staves).
<h3>Small notes/small noteheads</h3>
Select the note(s) you want in small size.

Check the "Small" checkbox in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
The one in the <code>Note</code> section is used to only change the size of the individual notehead; the one in the <code>Chord</code> section will change the note head, stem, beam, and flag sizes all together.


By default, the small size is 70% of the normal size. 
You can change that setting in <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style…</samp>→<samp>Sizes</samp>.
<h3>Change notes or rests already entered</h3>
<h4>Change duration</h4>
<strong>Version 3.3.3 and above</strong>

1. 

Make sure you are in <samp>Normal mode</samp>.

2. 
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more notes/rests, or note-stems/hooks. 

Apply the desired duration shortcut (listed <a href="#duration">above</a>), or click on the equivalent duration icon in the toolbar.
<strong>Prior to version 3.3.3</strong>

1. 

Make sure you are in <samp>Normal mode</samp>.

2. 
Click on a note or rest. 

Apply the desired duration shortcut (listed <a href="#duration">above</a>), or click on the equivalent duration icon in the toolbar.
<strong>Note</strong>: Increasing the duration will overwrite the notes or rests that follow it; decreasing the duration will add rests between it and the notes or rests following.
For example, to change three sixteenth rests into a single dotted eighth rest:

Click on the first sixteenth rest.
Hit <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd> to turn it into an eighth rest.
Hit <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> to turn it into a dotted eighth rest.

As the duration increases, it overwrites the other two sixteenth rests following it.
<h4>Change pitch</h4>
To change the pitch of a single note:

Make sure that you're not in <samp>note input mode</samp> and that you have no other notes selected.
Select the desired note and use any of the following methods:
Drag the notehead up or down with the mouse;

Press the keyboard arrows: <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Up) or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (down);
Type a new note letter name (A…G). 
Use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> to correct the octave, if necessary (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>). 

This will automatically turn on note input mode.
To change the enharmonic spelling of a note, select it and use the <kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd> command. 
For more information, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals">Accidentals</a>.

To change the pitches of a passage of music by a constant interval, you can use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition">Transposition</a>.
To change the pitches of a passage of music to a different melody, while keeping the rhythm unchanged, use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#repitch">Re-pitch mode</a>.
If your score contains a lot of misspelled accidentals, you might try the Respell Pitches command (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#respell-pitches">Accidentals: Respell pitches</a>).

<h4>Change voice</h4>
To change one or more notes to a different voice, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voices</a>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Palettes</span></h2>
A <strong>Palette</strong> is a folder containing musical symbols which can be applied to the score. 
Musescore's default palettes contain collections of related symbols, but you can customize palettes to display almost any kind of symbol, line or text. 

Palettes form the main part of a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-02/Palette_en.png?itok=laQPjYJn">

Musescore comes with two sets of <em>preset</em> palettes: a <strong>Basic</strong> and an <strong>Advanced</strong> set (contained in similarly-named <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>). 

But that is only the start. 
You can add your own symbols and text either to the existing palettes or to palettes you create in new workspaces. 
In other words, <em>you can customize each workspace to exactly meet your particular scoring needs</em>. 

See <a href="#custom-palettes">Customize palettes</a>.
<h3>View or hide the Palette area</h3>
The default position of the Palette area is to the left of the document window. 

 To view or hide it:
From the menu, select <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Palettes</samp>, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>.
To undock the Palette area:

Click the double-chevron symbol (circled in the image above), or double-click the top bar of the panel.
To re-attach the panel, double-click on the top bar again. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#side-panels">Side panels</a> for more information.

<h3>Open/close a palette</h3>
Click on the arrow next to the palette name, or double-click the palette name (in versions prior to MuseScore 3.3, click <em>once</em> on either the arrow or the palette name).
Symbols assigned to the palette are shown in a grid below the palette name. 

If you have customized one of Musescore's default palettes, clicking <strong>More</strong> will show any symbols you have deleted.
<h4>Single Palette mode</h4>
If you only want one palette open at a time, right-click at the top of the workspace (<kbd><samp class="button">...</samp></kbd>) and check the <samp>Single Palette</samp> box. 

Any opened palette will now close when you open a different one.
<h3>Apply symbols from a palette</h3>
<em>Versions 3.4 or above</em>

Select one or more score elements, then click the desired palette symbol. 
Or, drag and drop the symbol onto the desired score element in the staff.
<em>Versions prior to 3.4</em>

Select one or more score elements, then <em>double-click</em> the desired palette symbol. 
Or, drag and drop the symbol onto the desired score element in the staff.
If you are dragging a symbol to the score and decide you don't want to apply it, press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.

<em>Tip</em>: To prevent accidental rearrangement of contents during use, right-click a palette name and uncheck <samp>Enable Editing</samp>.
You can search for symbols or palette names by typing in the <strong>Search</strong> box at the top of the list. 
As you type, symbols and/or palettes with names matching your keystrokes are displayed below, updating continuously as your typed input changes. 

Displayed symbols can come from any palette, which makes this a powerful way to locate symbols without visually searching through various palettes .
Symbols can be applied directly from the search results as described above.
To restore the list of palette names, which is temporarily hidden by the search results, click <strong>X</strong> in the search box.

Anything added to the score from a palette can be copied, pasted, and duplicated: see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">Copy and paste</a>.
<h3>Customize the palette list</h3>
<h4>Change the order of palette names in the list</h4>
Drag the name of a palette up or down to any desired position.
<h4>Create a new palette</h4>
At the top of the palette list, click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Palettes</samp></kbd>→<kbd><samp class="button">Create custom palette</samp></kbd>. 

Or, right-click anywhere on the list of palette names and choose <samp>Insert New Palette</samp>.
Type the name of the new palette in the <strong>Create Palette</strong> dialog.


See <a href="#custom-palettes">Customize palettes</a> to learn how to add symbols to the new palette.
<h4>Hide a palette from the list</h4>
Hiding a palette depends on whether it is one of Musescore's default palettes or one you created yourself using the method above.

To hide a Musescore default palette:
Right-click the name of the palette you want to hide and click <samp>Hide Palette</samp>.
To hide a palette you created:

Right-click the name of the palette you want to hide, click <samp>Hide/Delete Palette</samp>, then click <kbd><samp class="button">Hide</samp></kbd> in the dialog.
<h4>Show a hidden palette in the list</h4>
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Palettes</samp></kbd> at the top of the palette list and click <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd> beside the palette name.

<h4>Delete a palette</h4>
Only palettes you created yourself can be deleted.
Right-click the name of the palette you want to delete, click <samp>Hide/Delete Palette</samp>, then click <kbd><samp class="button">Delete permanently</samp></kbd> in the dialog.

You cannot delete Musescore's default palettes. 
 If you don't intend to use a default palette, hide its name from the list instead.
<h3>Customize palettes</h3>
You can modify any Musescore default or user-created palette. 
Symbols may be added or deleted and layouts can be rearranged.
From MuseScore 3.3 onwards, all preset palettes in the Basic and Advanced workspaces can be customized directly (if you are using a previous version you will need to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces#create-new-workspace">create a new workspace</a> first).

Before customizing a palette:
Right-click on the palette name and make sure that <samp>Enable Editing</samp> is checked. 
It is automatically checked for new palettes you create yourself.

Make sure the palette is opened.

<h4>Add an existing score element to a palette</h4>
Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>), then drag the score element from the score onto a palette. 
The score element could be a symbol, line, text, dynamic, fretboard diagram, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/images#add-image">imported image</a> etc.
<h4>Add a symbol to a palette from the Master Palette</h4>
If the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/master-palette">Master Palette</a> is not visible, select <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Master Palette</samp> from the menu, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>fn</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>).
Drag the symbol from the Master Palette window onto a palette.
<h4>Change symbol order in a palette</h4>
Drag the symbol to the cell in which you wish to display it. 
 Nearby symbols will automatically move to make space available.
<h4>Change the position and size of a symbol in a palette cell</h4>
Right-click the cell and click <samp>Properties</samp>. 
The following dialog is displayed:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-10/Cell%20properties.png?itok=efyYhfnu">
<em>Name</em>: The tooltip that appears when you mouse over the cell.

<em>Content offset X, Y</em>: Adjusts the position of the symbol in the cell.
<em>Content scale</em>: Makes the symbol appear larger or smaller in the cell.
<em>Draw staff</em>: Draws the five lines of a musical staff behind the symbol.

<em>Note</em>: Changing these values only affects the appearance of symbols within the palette. 
It does not change their sizes or offsets on the score page.
<h4>Remove a symbol from a palette</h4>
Right-click the symbol and click <samp>Delete</samp>. 
 Or, select the symbol and click the trash icon to the right of the palette name.
The <strong>More</strong> command functions differently in a user-created palette. 

It displays one palette at a time from the palette list, allowing you to add symbols from that palette by dragging or by selecting an item and clicking <kbd><samp class="button">Add to</samp></kbd>. 
 Use <kbd><samp class="button">&lt;</samp></kbd> and <kbd><samp class="button">&gt;</samp></kbd> to step through the palettes in the list.
<h3>Palette menu</h3>
The following menu appears either by right-clicking the name of a palette or by clicking the <strong>...</strong> to the right of the name:
<samp>Hide Palette</samp>: Removes the name of the palette from the list of available palettes.
<samp>Hide/Delete Palette</samp>: Allows you to either hide or permanently delete a palette you created yourself. 

 Shown in place of the above menu item.
<samp>Insert New Palette</samp>: Creates a new empty palette. 
 Identical to <kbd><samp class="button">Add Palettes</samp></kbd>→<kbd><samp class="button">Create custom palette</samp></kbd>.

<samp>Enable Editing</samp>: Allows you to modify the contents and layout of the palette.
<samp>Reset Palette</samp>: Discards any customizations made to a palette and restores its default contents and layout.
<samp>Save Palette...</samp>: Saves the current palette as an .mpal file.

<samp>Load Palette...</samp>: Loads a palette from an .mpal file and displays the palette name in the list.
<samp>Palette Properties...</samp>: Displays the following dialog, where you can adjust the appearance of a palette:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/palette_properties_en.png?itok=TjvlXMKg">


<em>Name</em>: The name shown in the palette list.
<em>Cell Size: Width</em>, <em>Height</em>: The dimensions of each individual cell in the palette.
<em>Element Offset</em>: Adjusts the vertical offset of all symbols in the palette.

<em>Scale</em>: Makes all symbols in the palette appear larger or smaller.
<em>Show grid</em>: Draws a border around each palette cell.
<h3>Behavior of applied text and lines</h3>
If the symbol you are adding to the score from a palette contains a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> element (e.g. 
staff text, dynamic, fingering, volta etc.), then properties such as font type, font size, text color and alignment will adapt according to the following rules:
Text properties which have not been altered by the user will adopt the relevant <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">text styles</a>.

Custom text properties—those changed by the user before saving the symbol to a custom palette—remain as customized.
By contrast, the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#custom-lines">line properties</a> of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">lines</a> applied from a palette <em>always</em> remain unchanged (i.e. 
as set by the user before saving to a custom workspace, or as predefined in the Basic/Advanced workspaces).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Note input</span></h2>
MuseScore allows you to enter music notation from <em>any</em> of four <a href="#input-devices">input devices</a>: computer keyboard, mouse, MIDI keyboard, or virtual piano keyboard. 
The default <a href="#note-input-modes">input mode</a> is <strong>step-time</strong>, in which notes or rests are entered one at a  time. 

However, other <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">input modes</a> are also available.
After exiting the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a>,  your new score will consist of a series of measures filled with measure rests:

<h3>Basic note entry</h3>
This section introduces you to the basics of entering notes and rests in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#step-time">step-time</a> from a <em>computer keyboard</em>. 

It is also recommended that you work through the tutorial, "Getting Started: An introduction to note entry in MuseScore". 
This is available from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#start-center">Start Center</a>.
<h4>Step 1. 
Select a starting position</h4>
Select a starting position for note input by clicking on a note or rest, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">selecting a measure</a>, with the mouse. 
If you don't select a starting point, the cursor automatically defaults to the beginning of the score when you enter <strong>Note Input</strong> mode ("Step 2" <a href="#note-input-mode">below</a>).

<h4>Step 2. Enter Note Input mode</h4>
To enter <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, use either of the following options:

Click on the "N" icon (on the extreme left of the <strong>Note Input</strong> toolbar).
Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd> on your computer keyboard.
To exit <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, use any of the following options:

Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>.
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.
Click on the toolbar "N" button.

<h4>Step 3. Select a duration</h4>
Still in <strong>Note Input</strong> mode, select a note duration using either of the following:

Click on a corresponding note icon in the <strong>Note Input toolbar</strong> (directly above the document window):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-12/note_duration_toolbar.png?itok=Im04GlDv">
Enter the keyboard shortcut for that duration (see <a href="#note-rest-duration">below</a>).
<h4>Step 4. 
Enter the note or rest</h4>
To enter a note pitch from A–G, simply press the corresponding letter on your computer keyboard or place it using your mouse/touchpad (and a 'normal' left-click).
To enter a rest, press 0 (zero) or right-click your mouse.

This method of entry also works if you are <em>not</em> in Note Input mode—as long as you have a note/rest selected, or the score is newly-created (in which case note entry will default to the beginning).
<h3>Select a note/rest duration</h3>
The following keyboard shortcuts are used to select note/rest duration in <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode:

<strong>64th</strong> (hemidemisemiquaver): <kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd>

<strong>128th</strong> note (quasihemidemisemiquaver): Ditto.
<strong>256th</strong>, <strong>512th</strong> or <strong>1024th</strong> durations: First enter a 128th note (or longer), then half it as many times as needed using the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Q</kbd></kbd> or, as or 3.5, via a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcut</a>, or via the corresponding entries on the note input toolbar in a custom <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces#create-custom-workspace">workspace</a>.

<h3>Input devices</h3>
Music notation can be entered by:
<a href="#keyboard">Computer keyboard</a>.

<a href="#mouse">Mouse</a>.
<a href="#midi-keyboard">MIDI keyboard</a>.
<a href="#virtual-piano-keyboard">Virtual Piano Keyboard</a>.

Any combination of the above.
<h4>Computer keyboard</h4>
This section expands on "<a href="#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a>" (see above) and introduces you to the full range of commands available for entering notes or rests from the computer keyboard.

<h5>Enter notes/rests</h5>
You can enter a <strong>note</strong> by typing the corresponding letter on your keyboard. 
Thus, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode,  type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>B</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/noteentry1_1.png?itok=KdWuPbtQ">

<strong>Note</strong>: When you enter a note using the keyboard, MuseScore places it closest to the previous note entered (above or below).
To enter a <strong>rest</strong>, type "0" (zero). 

Thus, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode, type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry2_1.png?itok=cgLP2mau">
<strong>Note</strong>: The duration selected in the toolbar applies to both notes <em>and</em> rests.
If you want to enter  a <strong>dotted note</strong>, press <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> (period/full stop) after selecting the duration.

For example, after entering <a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input</a> mode, type: <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry4_1.png?itok=RdORVJwi">

If you want to enter a tuplet (such as a triplet): see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tuplets">Tuplets</a>.

If you want to write music with two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody on the same staff, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voices</a>.
<h5>Move notes up/down</h5>
To move a note up or down by a semitone:

Press the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>  or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> arrow.
To move a note up or down diatonically:
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>.

To move a note up or down by one octave:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>) or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>).
<h5>Add accidentals</h5>
When a note is moved up or down with an arrow key (see above), any accidental required is automatically generated by the program. 
Accidentals can also be added manually—see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals">Accidentals</a>.
<h5>Chords</h5>
If you want to add a chord note to your previous entry:
Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then enter a note from <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>.
Thus, typing <kbd><kbd>C</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>D</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>F</kbd></kbd> results in:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/noteentry3_1.png?itok=te1htZrs">
To add a note at a specific <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#interval">interval</a> above or below one or more notes:
Ensure that one or more notes are <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">selected</a>;
Use one of the following options:

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Intervals</samp> and choose an interval from the list;
Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd></kbd> for intervals <em>above</em> (intervals <em>below</em> are also possible by adding relevant <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">shortcuts</a> to the list in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences">Preferences</a>).


<strong>Note</strong>: To create chords with notes of different durations, you will need to use more than one <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voice</a>.
<h5>Insert notes</h5>
Normally, when you enter music in MuseScore, any existing notes or rests are overwritten. 

There are, however, several ways to <em>insert</em> notes:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#insert">Insert extra measures</a> into the score.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">Cut and paste</a> a section of the score forward, then enter music into the gap.

To insert a note, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd> + <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>) + the note name (<kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>). 
This will insert a note of the selected duration and move the rest of the notes to the right in the same measure. 
If the measure exceeds the duration of the time signature, the blue plus will appear above the measure as in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#timewise">Insert Mode</a>.

<h5>Delete notes</h5>
<strong>To delete a single note</strong>:
Select the note and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>).

<strong>To delete a chord</strong>:
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to ensure that you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>.
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and click on a note to select the chord.

Press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>).

The delete command can also be applied to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">range</a> of notes/chords.

<h5>Keyboard shortcuts</h5>
Here is a list of useful editing shortcuts available in Note Input mode:
<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Up): Increase the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ).

<kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Down): Decrease the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ).
<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-9</kbd></kbd>: Add interval (unison to ninth) above current note.
<kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd>: Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent (e.g. 

D to E). 
This alters the spelling in both concert pitch and transposed modes. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#change-enharmonic-spelling">Accidentals</a>.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd></kbd> (Mac <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd></kbd>): Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent. 
This alters the spelling only in the current mode. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#change-enharmonic-spelling">Accidentals</a>

<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>: Increase the pitch of a note using key signature
<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>: Decrease the pitch of a note using key signature
<kbd><kbd>R</kbd></kbd>: Repeat the last entered note

<kbd><kbd>Q</kbd></kbd>: Halve the duration of the last entered note
<kbd><kbd>W</kbd></kbd>: Double the duration of the last entered note
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd></kbd>: Decrease duration by a dot (for example, a dotted quarter note/crotchet becomes a quarter note/crotchet and a quarter note/crotchet becomes a dotted eighth note/quaver).

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd></kbd>: Increase duration by a dot (for example an eighth note/quaver becomes a dotted eighth note/quaver and a dotted eighth note/quaver becomes a quarter note/crotchet).
<kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd>: Undo last entered note
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd>: Exchange last entered note with the note before it (repeat to keep moving note earlier)

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>: Exchange note moved with <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> with the note that follows it
<kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd>: Flip direction of note stem (can be reset to Auto position in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>)
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd></kbd>: Move note head to opposite side of stem (can be reset to Auto position in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>)

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1-4</kbd></kbd>: Switch to corresponding <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a>)
<h4>Mouse</h4>
It's easy to enter notes with the mouse, but it is not the fastest way to enter lots of notes.

Click on the desired note duration symbol in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note input toolbar</a>.
Click on the score to add a pitch of the selected duration.
To <em>add</em> more notes to an existing chord, simply repeat step 2.

To <em>replace</em> an existing chord (rather than adding to it), press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> before clicking.
To add a rest, right-click.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you hover the cursor over the score in Note Input Mode it will show you a preview of the note or rest you are about to add.

<h4>MIDI keyboard</h4>
You can also insert pitches using a MIDI keyboard.
Connect your MIDI keyboard to the computer and switch the former on

Start MuseScore (this must be done <strong>after</strong> the keyboard is switched on)
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score">Create a new score</a>
Click the rest (selecting it) in measure 1 to indicate where you want note input to begin

Press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd> to enter <code>note input mode</code>
Select a note duration such as <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> for quarter notes (crotchets), as described <a href="#duration">above</a>
Press a note on your MIDI keyboard.

The pitch should be added to your score. 
 If the pitch does not appear, either use the toolbar and click 'Toggle MIDI Input' or follow these steps:
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>).

Click on the <kbd><samp>Note Input</samp></kbd> tab and check "Enable MIDI Input".
Click <kbd><kbd>OK</kbd></kbd> to exit. 
You will need to restart MuseScore to apply the change.


<strong>Note</strong>: The default method of entry, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#step-time">Step-time</a> allows you to enter one note at a time. 
Other note input modes are also available: see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">Note input modes</a>.

If you have multiple MIDI devices connected to your computer, you may need to inform MuseScore which is the MIDI keyboard:
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>).
Click on the <kbd><samp>I/O</samp></kbd> tab and select your device under the section labeled "MIDI input".

Click <kbd><kbd>OK</kbd></kbd> to exit. 
You will need to restart MuseScore to apply the change.


<h4>Virtual Piano Keyboard</h4>
You can also input notes using the on-screen <strong>piano keyboard</strong>.
<strong>To toggle the display on and off</strong>: Press <kbd><kbd>P</kbd></kbd> (or select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Piano</samp>).

<strong>To resize the keyboard</strong>: Position the mouse pointer over the piano keys, hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and move the mouse scroll wheel up (larger) or down (smaller).
The method of note entry is similar to that for a <a href="#midi-keyboard">midi keyboard</a>:
Ensure that you are in <samp><a href="#note-input-mode">Note Input mode</a></samp>.

To enter a:
<strong>Single note</strong>: Click on the appropriate piano key.
<strong>Chord</strong>: Select the note you wish to add to, press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, then click on a piano key (in versions before 2.1, use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>). 

Repeat as required.

<h3>Note input modes</h3>
MuseScore offers a variety of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes">note input modes</a> in addition to  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#steptime">Step-time</a>. 
All can be accessed by clicking the small  arrow next to the "N" button on the left of the Note Input toolbar:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/note_input_modes_new_EN.png?itok=OHGjIjbf">


<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#steptime">Step-time (default)</a>: The default mode of note entry. 
See <a href="#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a> (above).
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#repitch">Repitch</a>: Replace pitches without changing rhythms.

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#rhythm">Rhythm</a>: Enter durations with a single click or keypress.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#realtime-auto">Real-time (automatic)</a>: Perform the piece at a fixed tempo indicated by a metronome beat.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#realtime-manual">Real-time (manual)</a>: Perform the piece while tapping a key or pedal to set the beat.

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#timewise">Insert</a>: (Called "Timewise" until version 3.0.2) Insert and delete notes and rests within measures, automatically shifting subsequent music forwards or backwards.
<h3>Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range</h3>
Depending on the skill of the musician, certain notes are considered beyond the range of a particular instrument. 

For informational purposes, MuseScore <em>optionally</em> colors notes red if they are outside the range of a "professional" player, and olive green/dark yellow if outside the range of an "early amateur." The colors appear on the computer screen, but not on printed copies.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/out-of-range.png?itok=I69kpBS2">
To enable/disable note coloration and to set "professional" and "amateur" ranges, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Usable pitch range</a>  (Staff properties: all staves).
<h3>Small notes/small noteheads</h3>
Select the note(s) you want in small size.
Check the "Small" checkbox in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
The one in the <code>Note</code> section is used to only change the size of the individual notehead; the one in the <code>Chord</code> section will change the note head, stem, beam, and flag sizes all together.


By default, the small size is 70% of the normal size. 
You can change that setting in <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style…</samp>→<samp>Sizes</samp>.

<h3>Change notes or rests already entered</h3>
<h4>Change duration</h4>
<strong>Version 3.3.3 and above</strong>


1. 
Make sure you are in <samp>Normal mode</samp>.

2. 

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more notes/rests, or note-stems/hooks. 
Apply the desired duration shortcut (listed <a href="#duration">above</a>), or click on the equivalent duration icon in the toolbar.
<strong>Prior to version 3.3.3</strong>


1. 
Make sure you are in <samp>Normal mode</samp>.

2. 

Click on a note or rest. 
Apply the desired duration shortcut (listed <a href="#duration">above</a>), or click on the equivalent duration icon in the toolbar.
<strong>Note</strong>: Increasing the duration will overwrite the notes or rests that follow it; decreasing the duration will add rests between it and the notes or rests following.

For example, to change three sixteenth rests into a single dotted eighth rest:
Click on the first sixteenth rest.
Hit <kbd><kbd>4</kbd></kbd> to turn it into an eighth rest.

Hit <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> to turn it into a dotted eighth rest.
As the duration increases, it overwrites the other two sixteenth rests following it.
<h4>Change pitch</h4>
To change the pitch of a single note:
Make sure that you're not in <samp>note input mode</samp> and that you have no other notes selected.
Select the desired note and use any of the following methods:

Drag the notehead up or down with the mouse;
Press the keyboard arrows: <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Up) or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (down);
Type a new note letter name (A…G). 

Use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> to correct the octave, if necessary (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>). 
This will automatically turn on note input mode.
To change the enharmonic spelling of a note, select it and use the <kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd> command. 

For more information, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals">Accidentals</a>.
To change the pitches of a passage of music by a constant interval, you can use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition">Transposition</a>.
To change the pitches of a passage of music to a different melody, while keeping the rhythm unchanged, use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#repitch">Re-pitch mode</a>.

If your score contains a lot of misspelled accidentals, you might try the Respell Pitches command (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#respell-pitches">Accidentals: Respell pitches</a>).
<h4>Change voice</h4>
To change one or more notes to a different voice, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">Voices</a>.

<h4>Change rest to note and vice versa</h4>
To change a rest to a note of the same duration:
Make sure you are not in <samp>note input mode</samp> (press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to exit).

Select the rest.
Enter the desired pitch by entering a note letter, <kbd><kbd>A–G</kbd></kbd>.


To change a note to a rest of the same duration:
Make sure you are not in <samp>note input mode</samp> (press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to exit).
Select the note.

Press <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> (Zero).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Palettes</span></h2>
A <strong>Palette</strong> is a folder containing musical symbols which can be applied to the score. 

Musescore's default palettes contain collections of related symbols, but you can customize palettes to display almost any kind of symbol, line or text. 
Palettes form the main part of a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-02/Palette_en.png?itok=laQPjYJn">


Musescore comes with two sets of <em>preset</em> palettes: a <strong>Basic</strong> and an <strong>Advanced</strong> set (contained in similarly-named <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>). 
But that is only the start. 
You can add your own symbols and text either to the existing palettes or to palettes you create in new workspaces. 

In other words, <em>you can customize each workspace to exactly meet your particular scoring needs</em>. 
See <a href="#custom-palettes">Customize palettes</a>.
<h3>View or hide the Palette area</h3>
The default position of the Palette area is to the left of the document window. 
 To view or hide it:
From the menu, select <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Palettes</samp>, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>.

To undock the Palette area:
Click the double-chevron symbol (circled in the image above), or double-click the top bar of the panel.
To re-attach the panel, double-click on the top bar again. 

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#side-panels">Side panels</a> for more information.
<h3>Open/close a palette</h3>
Click on the arrow next to the palette name, or double-click the palette name (in versions prior to MuseScore 3.3, click <em>once</em> on either the arrow or the palette name).

Symbols assigned to the palette are shown in a grid below the palette name. 
If you have customized one of Musescore's default palettes, clicking <strong>More</strong> will show any symbols you have deleted.
<h4>Single Palette mode</h4>
If you only want one palette open at a time, right-click at the top of the workspace (<kbd><samp class="button">...</samp></kbd>) and check the <samp>Single Palette</samp> box. 
Any opened palette will now close when you open a different one.
<h3>Apply symbols from a palette</h3>

<h3>Behavior of applied text and lines</h3>
If the symbol you are adding to the score from a palette contains a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> element (e.g. 
staff text, dynamic, fingering, volta etc.), then properties such as font type, font size, text color and alignment will adapt according to the following rules:

Text properties which have not been altered by the user will adopt the relevant <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">text styles</a>.
Custom text properties—those changed by the user before saving the symbol to a custom palette—remain as customized.
By contrast, the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#custom-lines">line properties</a> of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">lines</a> applied from a palette <em>always</em> remain unchanged (i.e. 

as set by the user before saving to a custom workspace, or as predefined in the Basic/Advanced workspaces).

In the <strong>Create Key signature</strong> panel, drag accidentals from the palette onto the staff above to create the desired key signature. <strong>Note</strong>: The treble clef is only decorative—custom key signatures for any type of staff can be created here.
Use the <kbd><samp class="button">Clear</samp></kbd> button, if required, to remove all accidentals from the "staff."

To move the new key signature into the library (center panel), press <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd>. 
To delete a key signature from the library, right-click it (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click) and, in the drop-down menu, select <samp>Delete</samp>.


<strong>Note</strong>: A limitation of custom key signatures is that they cannot be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition">transposed</a> in the usual way. 
If a transposition is needed, or where there is a clef change, you will need to create a new custom key signature.
To move a key signature from the Master palette to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/custom-palettes">custom palette</a>:

Drag and drop the key signature onto a palette.
To apply a key signature to the score directly from the Master palette, use one of the following methods:
Select a measure and click a key signature in the Master palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag a key signature from the Master palette onto a measure; alternatively, <em>to apply to one staff only</em>, hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) while dragging.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Time signatures</span></h2>
<strong>Time signatures</strong> can be found in a  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">Palette</a> of the same name in both the Basic and Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-11/Palette-Time_Signatures.png?itok=Lvf4TYsp">

<h3>Add or replace a time signature</h3>
Use any of the following methods:

Select a time signature, measure, note or rest, and click a time signature in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop a time signature from a palette onto a space in a measure, or onto an existing time signature.
<h3>Delete a time signature</h3>
To delete a time signature in the score, select it and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.
<h3>Create a time signature</h3>
If the time signature you require is not available in any of the existing <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palettes</a>, it can be created using one of the following methods:

<h4>From the Time Signatures palette</h4>
Available as of version 3.3.
In the <em>Time Signatures</em> palette, click on "More", then, in the supplementary palette, click on the "Create Time Signature" button;

In the top line, enter the Numerator, Denominator, and Text (the latter is optional where you need the display to be different from the actual time signature).
Adjust the default note beaming in the <em>Note Groups</em> section. 
 To restore the default beaming pattern, press <kbd><samp class="button">Reset</samp></kbd>;

Press the "Add" button to transfer the newly-created time signature to the <em>Time Signatures</em> palette.

<h4>From the Master palette</h4>
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd> to display the <strong>Time signatures</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/master-palette">Master Palette</a>;
Select a time signature to edit in the center panel;
In the top line of the <em>Create Time Signature</em> panel, enter the Numerator, Denominator, and Text (the latter is optional where you need the display to be different from the actual time signature).

Adjust the default note beaming in the "Note group" section". 
 To restore the default beaming pattern, press <kbd><samp class="button">Reset</samp></kbd>;
Press <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd> to add the newly-created time signature to the center panel. 

To delete a time signature from the center panel, right-click (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click) on it and select <samp>Clear</samp>.
Drag and drop the time signature from the Master Palette to the <em>Time Signatures</em> palette. 
You can also drag the time signature direct to the score, if desired.


<h3>Fractional time signatures</h3>
Starting in version 3.5.1 there is limited support for fractional time signatures. 

Only  and  are supported at this time. 
If your keyboard does not have the characters on them you can enter them using <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>8</kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd> for  and <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>8</kbd><kbd>8</kbd></kbd> for  on some operating systems. 
You can also copy/paste from here.

<h3>Time signature properties</h3>
To display the <strong>Time Signature Properties</strong> dialog, use any of the following:
Select the time signature, then click on "Properties" in the "Time Signature" section of the Inspector.

Right-click (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click) on a time signature and select <samp>Time Signature Properties…</samp>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-02/Time_sig_properties.png?itok=vO2uCOCw">

<strong>Global value</strong>: Shows the global time signature and is set automatically when you <a href="#add-time-signature">add a time signature to the score</a>. 

It is the reference for beats (as shown in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#status-bar">status bar</a>) and tempo markings.
<strong>Actual value</strong>: Shows the time signature associated with a particular staff. 
This is normally the same as the global time signature, but can be set independently if required. 

See <a href="#local-time-signatures">Local time signatures</a>.
<strong>Appearance</strong>: Allows you to edit the displayed text without affecting the underlying time signature. 
For an example, see <a href="#additive-meters">Additive meters</a>.

<strong>Note Groups</strong>: Allows you to change the default beaming of notes associated with a time signature. 
See <a href="#change-default-beaming">Change default beaming</a>.
<h4>Change default beaming</h4>
To adjust note-beaming for a particular time signature:
Select the time signature, then "Properties" in the "Time Signature" section of the Inspector; or right-click (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click) on the time signature and select, <samp>Time Signature Properties…</samp>;
To break a note beam in the <strong>Note Groups</strong> panel, click on the note following it. 

To reset the beam, click in the same place. 
Alternatively, you can change beaming by dragging a beam icon onto a note, as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/beam_start.png?itok=wnutk-VT">
Start beam at this note.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/beam_middle.png?itok=KBeOEy6F">

Do not end beam at this note.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/beam_semi_sub.png?itok=htI1Fsk0">


1/8th note beam to left of this note.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/beam_demisemi_sub.png?itok=WhMakiwQ">
1/16 note beam to left of this note.


Checking the box for "Also change shorter notes," means that any beam changes at one level are applied automatically to shorter durations as well. 
The <kbd><samp class="button">Reset</samp></kbd> button cancels any changes made in that session.
<h4>Additive (composite) meters</h4>
Additive (or composite) time signatures are sometimes used to clarify the division of beats within a measure. 
To create an additive time signature:
Right-click (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click) on a time signature in the score and select <samp>Time Signature properties…</samp>;

In the <strong>Appearance</strong> section, adjust the "Text" property as required;
Adjust note beaming in the <strong>Note Groups</strong> section if required.


<strong>Note</strong>: The <a href="#create-time-signature">Time Signatures</a> section of the Master palette also allows you to create additive time signatures (see above).
<h4>Local time signatures</h4>
In certain cases a score may show staves with different time signatures running at the same time. 

For example, in Bach's 26. 
Goldberg Variation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/gb26-1_0.png?itok=Iic7Dmfb, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/gb26-1_0.png?itok=3o6u3cTt 2x">


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/gb26-1_0.png?itok=PaynN9je">
In the above example, the <a href="#add-time-signature">global time signature</a> is 3/4, but the time signature of the upper staff has been set independently to 18/16.
To set a <strong>local time signature</strong> for just one staff:
Hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and drag and drop a time signature from a palette onto an empty measure.

<h3>Resize time signature</h3>
Select one or more time signatures and, in the "Time Signature" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, adjust the "Scale X" (width) and "Scale Y" (height) values.
<h3>Pickup measures and cadenzas</h3>
Occasionally you will need to decrease or increase the duration of a measure without changing the time signature—for example, in a pickup measure (anacrusis) or in a cadenza etc. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#duration">Measure operations: Measure duration</a>.
<h3>Time signature changes and breaks</h3>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-rests#multimeasure-rest">Multimeasure rests</a> are interrupted when a time signature change occurs. 
Also, a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section break</a> will prevent a courtesy time signature being shown at the end of the previous measure.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Bends</span></h2>

<strong>Bends</strong>, of various kinds, can be created with the <strong>Bend Tool</strong>  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/bend_palette_sym_0.png?itok=MarMZeXv">

. 

You can find this in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/articulations-and-ornaments">Articulations</a> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> of the Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>. 
Any bend applied to the score can be customized in the <strong>Bend</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<h3>Apply a bend</h3>
To apply one or more bends to the score, use one of the following options:
Select one or more notes and double-click a bend symbol in the palette.
Drag a bend symbol from the palette on to a note.

<h3>Edit bend</h3>
<h4>Text and line properties</h4>
Select the bend.

Adjust the following properties in the  <strong>Bend</strong> section of the Inspector:
<em>Line thickness</em>.
<em>Font, Size, Style</em>: Properties of the text.

<em>Play</em> (checkbox): Whether the bend affects playback or not.

Global text and line properties for all bends in the score can be edited in <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp>Bend</samp>.

<h4>Bend shape and width</h4>
<em>Versions 3.4 and above:</em>
Make sure that the bend is selected.

In the "Bend" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> use the <strong>Bend type</strong> dropdown to choose from a range of presets. 
"Bend" is the default option.
Make adjustments, as required, to the graphical display of the bend in the Inspector: see <a href="#edit-graph">Edit graphical display</a> (below).


<em>Versions prior to 3.4:</em>
Select the bend and click on <strong>Properties</strong> in the Inspector; Alternatively, right-click on the bend and select "Bend Properties".


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/bend_properties_0.png?itok=fiK1xt2m">

Choose from a range of presets under <strong>Bend type</strong>. 
"Bend" is the default option.

Make adjustments, as required, to the graphical display of the bend: see <a href="#edit-graph">Edit graphical display</a> (below).
<h5>Edit graphical display</h5>
The bend is represented by a graph consisting of gray lines connected by square, blue <strong>nodes</strong> (see image above). 

The slope of the line indicates the type of bend:
Up-slope = Up-bend
Down-slope = Down-bend

Horizontal line = Hold
The <strong>vertical axis</strong> of the graph represents the amount by which the pitch is bent up or down: one unit equals a quarter-tone: 2 units a semitone, 4 units a whole-tone, and so on. 
The <strong>horizontal axis</strong> of the graph indicates the length of the bend: each gray line segment extends for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">1 space (sp)</a> in the score.

A bend is modified by adding or deleting nodes in the graph:
To <strong>add</strong> a node, click on an empty intersection.
To <strong>delete</strong> a node, click on it.

Adding a node <em>lengthens</em> the bend by 1 sp; deleting a node <em>shortens</em> the bend by 1 sp. 
The <em>Start</em> and <em>End</em> points of the bend can be moved up and down only.
<h3>Adjust height</h3>
The height of the bend symbol is automatically adjusted so that the text appears just above the staff. 
This height can be adjusted, if necessary, with a workaround:
Create another note vertically above the note (shortening the line) or below the note (extending the line) at which you want the bend to start.

Apply the bend to the created note.
To adjust the height of the bend move this created note vertically so that the bend symbol gets the desired height.
Drag the bend symbol to the correct position (to the original note).

Mark the created note invisible and silent (using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>).

<h3>Adjust position</h3>
To adjust position use one of the following:
Drag the bend symbol with a mouse.
Click on the symbol and adjust the horizontal and vertical offsets in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

Double-click on the symbol; or click on it and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></kbd>); or right-click on the symbol and select "Edit element." Then use the arrow keys for fine positioning (0.1 sp at a time); or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd></kbd>) for larger adjustments (1 sp at a time).
<h3>Custom bends</h3>
After a bend has been created in the score it can be saved for future use by dragging and dropping the symbol to a palette while holding down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Beams</span></h2>
<h3>Adjust automatic note beaming</h3>
By default, MuseScore beams notes according to settings in the <strong>Time Signature Properties</strong> dialog. 
To change this automatic pattern of note-beaming, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/time-signatures#change-default-beaming">Change default beaming</a>.
<h3>Change beaming of individual notes</h3>
MuseScore also allows you to override the default beaming of any note, using the <strong>beam symbols</strong> in the <strong>Beam Properties</strong> palette of the "Basic" or "Advanced" <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Beam_Properties_0.png?itok=x7XufRzz">

<strong>To change one or more note beams</strong> (except feathered beams, below), use one of the following methods:

Drag and drop a beam symbol from the <strong>Beam Properties</strong> palette onto a note or rest in the score.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more notes and/or rests in the score and click the desired symbol in the <strong>Beam Properties</strong> palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
<strong>To apply feathered note beams</strong>, use either of the following methods:

Drag and drop a feathered-beam symbol from the <strong>Beam Properties</strong> palette onto a note beam in the score.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more note beams in the score, then click on a feathered-beam symbol in the <strong>Beam Properties</strong> palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) Feathered beams may use 2 or 3 lines depending on the tempo and the desired rate of the change; (2) To create a 2-line feathered beam, you need to start with a <em>continuous</em> run of beamed sixteenth notes; (3) To create a 3-line feathered beam, you need to start with <em>continuous</em> run of beamed thirty-second notes; (4) Playback of feathered beams is not supported.

<strong>Note</strong>: Be aware that the beam between two notes/rests is determined by both of the note/rests. 
For example: Two consecutive notes with a status of start beam here will not have a beam between them. 
If the two consecutive notes are set up to connect to each other they will beam, if one of them is not set up for this, the two notes will not beam.

<h3>Adjust beam angle</h3>
To adjust with the keyboard or mouse:
Enter <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">edit mode</a></samp> on the note beam—the right adjustment handle is automatically selected.

Use the up/down arrows or drag the right end handle to change the angle of the beam;
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to exit edit mode.


To adjust with the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>:
Click on a note beam.
Tick the "User position" box in the "Beam" section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>;

Set the "Position" values to get the desired beam angle.

<h3>Adjust beam height</h3>
To adjust with the keyboard or mouse:
Enter <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">edit mode</a></samp> on the note beam—the right adjustment handle is automatically selected.
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> or click the middle handle to select it (use the left handle prior to 3.4);

Use the up/down arrows or drag the middle handle to change the height of the beam (use the left handle prior to 3.4);
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to exit edit mode.


To adjust with the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>:
Click on a note beam.
Tick the "User position" box in the "Beam" section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>;

Set the "Position" values as desired.

<h3>Make beam horizontal</h3>
Select a note beam
Tick the "Force Horizontal" box in the "Beam" section of the Inspector;
<strong>Note</strong>: "Force Horizontal" in the "Beam" section of the Inspector can only be selected if "Custom position" has been deselected previously. 

This setting overrides the Custom Position values and automatically sets the horizontal bar to its original height.
If you want all note beams in the score to be horizontal there is a "Flatten all beams" option in <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp>Beams</samp>. 
If this option is not selected, automatically inclined beams will be set according to the pitch of the connected notes. 

This global setting can be overridden for individual beams according to the methods described above.
<h3>Adjust feathered beams</h3>
To adjust feathered beams:

Select a note beam.
Adjust the values in the "Grow left" and "Grow right" boxes in the "Beam" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.


<h3>Local relayout</h3>
MuseScore spaces notes according to their time values, allowing for accidentals, lyrics etc. 
In systems where there is more than one staff, this may result in irregular note spacing, as in the following example:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-11/normal_layout_100dpi.png?itok=-v3frVgo">
<strong>Local relayout</strong> is a tickbox option in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> allowing you to specify those passages in the score where you want the note spacing to be independent of other staves in the system. 
Applying "Local relayout" to the note beams in the top staff of the previous example results in a more even distribution of notes:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-11/local_relayout_100dpi.png?itok=7DMWHwGe">


To do a local relayout:
Select one or more note beams.
Tick the option <strong>Local relayout</strong> in the "Beam" section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>.

<h3>Flip note beam</h3>
To flip a beam from above to below the notes, or vice-versa:
Select one or more note beams.

Use any of the following options:
Press the <kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> key;
Press the "Flip direction" icon, 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/flip_direction.PNG?itok=-OLDcV-u">

, in the toolbar.
Select a "Direction" option (Auto, Up or Down) in the "Beam" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.


<h3>Reset Beam Mode</h3>
To restore beams to the mode defined in the local time signatures:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the section of the score you want to reset. 
If nothing is selected, the operation will apply to the whole score;
Select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Reset Beams</samp>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Brackets</span></h2>

MuseScore provides <strong>brackets</strong> and a curly <strong>brace</strong> in the <strong>Brackets</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Brackets.png?itok=uxU5Lvnw">

When a new score is created using a template, MuseScore automatically sets the correct brackets.

<h3>Add</h3>
To add a bracket or brace to systems, use one of two methods:
Select a measure on the staff where you want the bracket/brace to start, and click the desired icon in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag a bracket/brace icon from a palette on to the staff where you want the bracket/brace to start.
<h3>Delete</h3>
Select the bracket and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.

<h3>Change</h3>
Drag the desired icon from a palette onto an existing bracket/brace in the score.
<h3>Edit</h3>
When you first apply a bracket it only spans one staff. 
To extend to other staves:
Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">Edit mode</a>.

Drag the handle downwards to span the required staves. 
The handle snaps into position, so exact placement is not required.


<h3>Style</h3>
The default thickness and distance from the system of brackets and braces can be adjusted in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-system">Format→ Style... 
→ System</a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-10/Brackets_Properties.png?itok=yutjDdBN, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-10/Brackets_Properties.png?itok=2_UWf9Ki 2x">

In the <strong>System Brackets</strong> section, you can set the properties for the brackets in the two boxes on the left, and the properties for the braces in the two boxes on the right.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Breaths and pauses</span></h2>
<strong>Breath</strong> and <strong>pause</strong> markings are available in the <strong>Breaths &amp; Pauses</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/breaths_pauses.png?itok=pPLIxzEo">
<h3>Add symbol</h3>
To add a breath, or pause (aka <em>caesura</em> / "tram lines" / "railroad tracks") to the score, use one of the following options:
Select a note or rest and click a breath or pause symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag  a breath or pause symbol from a palette onto a note or rest in the score.
The symbol is placed <em>after</em> the note. 
Its position can be adjusted by editing the X and Y offsets in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>, or, in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">edit mode</a>, using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#keyboard-shortcuts">arrow keys</a>.

<h3>Adjust pause length</h3>
You can adjust the pause length (in seconds) of the added symbol in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Grace notes</span></h2>
A <strong>grace note</strong> is a type of musical ornament, usually printed smaller than regular notes. 
The <strong>Short grace note</strong>, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#acciaccatura">Acciaccatura</a>, appears as a small note with a stroke through the stem. 

The <strong>Long grace note</strong>, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#appoggiatura">Appoggiatura</a>, has no stroke.
<h3>Create grace notes</h3>
Grace notes can be found in the "Grace notes" <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in the Basic or Advanced workspace.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Grace_Notes.png?itok=eEKvF0_b">

<h4><strong>Add a grace note</strong></h4>
Use one of the following methods:

Select a regular note and click a grace note in a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a grace note symbol from a palette onto a regular note.
Select a note and press <kbd><kbd>/</kbd></kbd> to create an acciaccatura only.

This will add a grace note of the same pitch as the regular note. 
To add a <em>sequence</em> of grace notes to a regular note, simply repeat the above actions as many times as required. 
See also, <a href="#change-pitch">Change pitch</a> (below).

<em>Note</em>: When a grace note is added to the score, a slur is <em>not</em> automatically created with it, so the latter needs to be added separately. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs">Slurs</a>.
<h4><strong>Add a chord of grace notes</strong></h4>
Grace note chords are built up just like regular chords:
Enter the first note of the chord as shown above
Select this first grace note and enter subsequent notes as you would for any other regular chord (i.e. 

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>...<kbd><kbd>G</kbd></kbd>).

You can also create a grace note chord by using the <strong>add interval</strong> shortcut in step 2: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></kbd>...<kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd> for intervals from a unison to a ninth above.

<h3>Change pitch</h3>
The pitch of a grace note can be adjusted just like a regular one:
Select one or more grace notes

Adjust pitch using the keyboard arrow commands, namely:
<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> to increase or decrease the pitch by a semitone;
<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> to increase or decrease the pitch one step at a time, according to the key signature.


<h3>Change duration</h3>
Select the grace note and either click a duration icon on the toolbar, or apply the duration with the appropriate keyboard shortcut: i.e. 

<kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd>...<kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd> (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-rest-duration">Note input</a>).
<h3>Manual adjustment</h3>
<h4>Horizontal position</h4>
To adjust the horizontal space between a grace note and its regular parent note, use one of the following:
Go into <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#notes">edit mode</a> on the grace note, then use the left/right arrow keys to reposition as desired.
Select the grace note and change the X-offset value in the  <strong><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#chord">Chord</a></strong> section of the Inspector.

<h4>Other adjustments</h4>
Various other properties of the grace note can be adjusted in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> (see "<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Element</a>," "<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#chord">Chord</a>", and "<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#note">Note</a>" sections)—such as vertical position, size, stem properties etc. 
The exception is "Leading space" which only applies to standard notes.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Hairpins</span></h2>

<strong>Hairpins</strong> are symbols used to indicate gradual changes in volume in the score. 
There are two kinds: <strong>crescendo</strong> (getting louder) and <strong>decrescendo</strong> (getting quieter).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/hairpins.png?itok=ISGxhALQ">

Then click on the end handle that you want to move:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Hairpin2.png?itok=LdaIQbZf">


Use one of the following shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle, and its <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#anchor">anchor</a>, right by one note or rest.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle, and its anchor, left by one note or rest;

This method of extending or shortening the hairpin maintains <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#lines-playback-properties">playback integrity</a> and allows it to cross line breaks:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Hairpin3.png?itok=IrlXE43t">
To fine-tune the horizontal position of an end-handle (without changing playback), use the following shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the handle right by 0.1 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp</a>.

<kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the handle left 0.1 sp.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>) to move the handle right one sp.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>) to move the handle left one sp.

<strong>To change the height of a hairpin</strong>:
Adjust the lower handle at the mouth of the hairpin (e.g. 
the blue square below):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-12/adjust_hairpin_width.PNG?itok=FNrQloFJ">

<h3>Cresc. 
and dim. 

lines</h3>
In addition to hairpins, there are <em>cresc. 
 _   _   _</em> and <em>dim. 

 _   _   _</em> lines with the same function in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">Lines</a> palette. 
You can adjust the text, if desired, in the <strong>Text Line Core</strong> section of the Inspector.
<strong>To turn a hairpin into its equivalent text line</strong>:

Select the hairpin and, in the <strong>Hairpin</strong> section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>, select the appropriate line from "Type."
<h3>Copy hairpins</h3>
From version 3.1, a hairpin can be cut, copied and pasted just like a text element: see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste#command-summary">Summary of cut / copy / paste commands</a>.

For versions prior to 3.1, you can only duplicate a hairpin: see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#copy-line">Copying lines</a>.
<h3>Edit hairpin properties</h3>
Properties of the hairpin can be edited in the Inspector, as follows:

<strong>Element</strong>: Edit the Y offset to change the height of the hairpin above or below the staff.
<strong>Line</strong>: Edit line properties such as color, line style and thickness.
<strong>Text line core</strong>: Add text and set text properties.

<strong>Hairpin</strong>:
<strong>Type</strong>: Change the type of hairpin: crescendo, decrescendo or text.
<strong>Circled tip</strong>: Tick box to activate.

<strong>Height</strong>: The width at the mouth of the hairpin.
<strong>Continue height</strong>: The width of the hairpin at the end of a system, before it continues to the next system.
<strong>Placement</strong>: Set hairpin above or below the staff.

<strong>Dynamic range</strong>: Specify whether hairpin playback applies to a staff, part (default) or a system.
<strong>Velocity change</strong>: … across the span of the hairpin; from 0 to 127.
<strong>Use single note dynamics</strong> (as of version 3.1): When checked (default), allows the hairpin to change the dynamic of a single note if the instrument supports single note dynamics.

<strong>Dynamic Mode</strong> (as of version 3.1): Set the method used to change the dynamic: Linear (default), Ease-in and out, Ease-in, Ease-out, or Exponential.
<h3>Playback of hairpins</h3>
By default, a hairpin always affects playback when it spans a series of <em>separate</em> notes. 

In addition, for instruments supporting single note dynamics (e.g. 
strings, brass etc.), playback is also enabled across a <em>single</em> note or series of <em><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/2/ties">tied</a></em> notes. 
(<em>Note</em>: Prior to version 3.1 hairpins only affected playback <em>between</em> notes, not that of single or tied notes.)

A hairpin only affect playback if there are <em>appropriate</em> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/dynamics">dynamics</a> somewhere <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the hairpin. 
For example, a crescendo between <strong><em>p</em></strong> and <strong><em>f</em></strong> dynamics <em>will</em> affect playback;  but a diminuendo between <strong><em>p</em></strong> and <strong><em>f</em></strong> will be ignored. 
And if there are two or more crescendos between <strong><em>p</em></strong> and <strong><em>f</em></strong>, all but the first will be ignored.

A hairpin may be used without dynamic marks, by adjusting "Velocity change" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> (values in the range 0 to 127).
<h2><br><span class="orange">Lines</span></h2>

The <strong>Lines</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> of the Advanced workspace contains the following lines:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Lines_0.png?itok=bts2f5Tq">
As you can see, the palette includes: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs">Slurs</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/hairpins">Hairpins</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Volta brackets</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/octave-lines">Octave lines</a>, and many others.
<h3>Applying lines to the score</h3>
Most lines (except <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs">Slurs</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Volta brackets</a>  and the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/early-music-features#ambitus">Ambitus</a>) can be applied from a palette in the following ways:
<h4>To apply a line to <em>just</em> one note</h4>
Click on a note, then <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></kbd> on the next note;

In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

<h4>To apply a line across a range of notes</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#shift-click-selection">range</a> of notes;
In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).


<h4>To apply a line from a note to the end of that measure</h4>
Use any of the following methods:
Click on a note, then, in a palette, click on a line (double-click the latter in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag and drop a line onto the score.
<h4>To apply a line across a range of measures</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#select-measure">Select</a> one or more measures;

In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

<h3>Lines and playback properties</h3>
Some lines, such as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/hairpins">Hairpins</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Voltas</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/octave-lines">Ottavas</a> etc., also have an effect on the <em>playback</em> of the score itself. 
Each <strong>end handle</strong> is connected by a dotted line to an <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#anchor">anchor</a> on the staff (visible in  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">Edit mode</a>). 
These anchors indicate the <em>extent</em> of the playback effect.

<h3>Adjust vertical position</h3>
In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>, apply one of the following methods:
Click on one or more lines and change the vertical offset in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>;

Click on a line, press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and drag it up/down with a mouse.
<strong>Note</strong>: You can also adjust the vertical position in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#lines">Edit</a> mode.
<h3>Change length</h3>
<strong>Note</strong>: The following two methods move the end of the line <em>and</em> its <a href="#lines-playback-properties">anchor</a> <em>together</em>. 
This ensures that correct playback of the score is maintained (if applicable), and that the line can be extended between <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#system">systems</a> if required.
<h4>Using keyboard shortcuts</h4>
Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">Edit mode</a> and click on an end handle;
Apply one of the following shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle, and its anchor, to the right by one note (or, in the case of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Voltas</a>, one measure)

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle, and its anchor, to the left by one note (or, in the case of Voltas, one measure);

<h4>By dragging (as of version 3.5)</h4>
Click on the end handle of a line and drag it with the mouse.
<h4>Fine adjustment</h4>
To make <strong>fine adjustments</strong> to the position of the line end (without changing the position of the anchor):

Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">Edit mode</a> and click on an end handle;
Apply one of the following shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the handle right by 0.1 <strong>sp</strong> (1 sp = one staff space = the distance between two staff lines).

<kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the handle left 0.1 sp.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>) to move the handle right one sp.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>) to move the handle left one sp.


<h3>Text lines</h3>
A <strong>text line</strong> is a line that has <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> embedded within it—such as a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">volta</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/octave-lines">ottava</a>, guitar barre line etc.

When you apply a text line to the score from a palette, the <em>line</em> properties always remain unchanged, but the <em>text</em> properties may, under certain circumstances, assume those of the current <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">style</a> for text lines. 
For details, see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#text-line-behavior">Behavior of applied text and lines</a>.
<h3>Custom lines</h3>
Any line in the score can be customized by adjusting its properties in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, as follows:
Select the line;
If <em>line hooks</em> are needed, make a selection from <strong>Begin hook</strong>, <strong>End hook</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> (in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#text-line-core">Text Line Core</a> section);

To add <em>text</em>, tick <strong>Begin Text</strong>, <strong>Continue Text</strong> or <strong>End Text</strong>, then type in the "Text" box:
<strong>Begin</strong>: Text added here appears at the beginning of the line;
<strong>Continue</strong>: Text added here appears at the beginning of a continuation line (in the next system, if any);

<strong>End</strong>: Text added here appears at the end of the line;
Edit <em>text properties</em> and <em>alignment</em> as required;
Edit <strong>Placement</strong>: "Above" or "Below" sets the text so that it is on the line. 

"Left" places the text to the left of the line;
Make adjustments to the line color, thickness and style (solid, dashed etc.) in the <strong>Line</strong> section. 
The <strong>Diagonal</strong> option allows you to create a diagonal line by dragging the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#lines">end handles</a>;

To save the result for future use, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">Custom palettes</a>.

<h3>Copying lines</h3>
Once applied to the score, lines cannot be copied using the usual <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">copy and paste</a> procedures. 
However, you can <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste#duplicate">duplicate</a> lines within a score:
Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>), click on the line and drag it to the desired location.

<h3>Extended ornament lines</h3>
To add an accidental to an extended ornament (e.g. 
a trill line), select the line and click on a symbol in the Accidentals palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Measure rests</span></h2>
<h3>Full measure rest</h3>
A <strong>whole rest</strong>, centered within a measure (shown below), is used to indicate that an entire measure (or a voice within a measure) is silent, regardless of time signature.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/full-measure-rest_1.png?itok=LiS15L5g">

<h4>To create one or more full measure rests</h4>
Use the following method if all selected measures are "standard"—i.e. 
with no <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#duration">custom durations</a>:
1 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> a measure, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">range</a> of measures.


2. 
Press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.
If one or more of the measures contains a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#duration">custom duration</a>, use the following method instead:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> a measure, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">range</a> of measures.
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>).


<h4>To create a full measure rest in a <em>particular</em> voice</h4>
In the appropriate voice, enter a rest that extends for the full measure.
Make sure the rest is selected, then press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>).


<h3>Multimeasure rest</h3>
A <strong>Multimeasure rest</strong> indicates a period of silence for an instrument: the number of measures is shown by the number above the staff.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/multimeasure-rests_4.png?itok=MpgwC4jE">
Multimeasure rests are automatically interrupted at important points, such as double barlines, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/rehearsal-marks">rehearsal marks</a>, key- or time signature changes, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section breaks</a> etc. 
and also at measures that are set to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#break-multimeasure-rests">break multimeasure rests</a>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Octave lines</span></h2>
<strong>Octave (Ottava) lines</strong> are used to indicate that a section of music is to be played one or more octaves above or below written pitch: The line may be dotted or solid. 

Ottavas are available in the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">Lines</a> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> of the Basic and Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>.
<em>8</em>─────┐or <em>8va</em>─────┐: Play one octave above written pitch
<em>8</em>─────┘or <em>8va</em>─────┘: Play one octave below written pitch
8va alta/bassa lines are particularly common in piano scores, though they are sometimes used in other instrumental music.<sup><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  15ma alta (2 octaves above) and 15ma bassa (2 octaves below) are also occasionally used.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/8va_debussy_prelude_10.png?itok=JvQW8Vdj">

MuseScore automatically adjusts playback of the score under the ottava to the correct pitch.
<h3>Apply an octave line</h3>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines#apply_lines">Applying lines to the score</a>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Slurs</span></h2>
A <strong>slur</strong> is a curved line between two or more notes indicating that they are to be played <em>legato</em>—smoothly and without separation. 
Not to be confused with <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/ties">Ties</a>, which join two notes of the same pitch.

There are a number of ways to add a slur to a score, and all may be useful depending on the context (adding a slur from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">lines palette</a> is also possible but not recommended).
<h3>Add slur in note-input mode</h3>
While in <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">Note input mode</a></samp>, type in the first note in the slurred section;

Press <kbd><kbd>S</kbd></kbd> to begin the slurred section;
Type in the remaining notes in the slurred section;
Press <kbd><kbd>S</kbd></kbd> again to end the slurred section.


<h3>Add slur in Normal mode</h3>
<h4>Method 1</h4>
Make sure you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>;
Select the note where you want the slur to start:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Slur1_0.png?itok=tvqYew1Q">


Press <kbd><kbd>S</kbd></kbd> to add a slur extending to the next note:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Slur2_0.png?itok=gW5nl-Zg">

(Optional) Hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and press <kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd> (right arrow key) to extend the slur to the next note. 

Repeat as required:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Slur3_0.png?itok=Mk-xF1Ys">
(Optional) Press <kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> to flip the slur direction:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Slur4_0.png?itok=YjRF6JVz">


Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to exit <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">edit mode</a></samp>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Slur5_0.png?itok=7L0pi0NR">

<h4>Method 2</h4>
Make sure you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>;
Select the note where you want the slur to start;
Choose one of the following options:

To add a slur to one voice <em>only</em>: Hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>  (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and select the last note that you want the slur to cover.
To add slurs to <em>all</em> voices: Hold down <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>  (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and select the last note that you want the slurs to cover.
Press <kbd><kbd>S</kbd></kbd>.

<h3>Adjust slur</h3>
If you only want to adjust the <em>position</em> of a slur:
Select the slur;

Use any of the following methods:
Drag the slur.
Adjust the horizontal and vertical offset values in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>.


To adjust <em>all</em> the properties of a slur (length, shape and position):
Make sure you are <em>not</em> in <samp>note input mode</samp>;

Go into <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">Edit mode</a></samp> on the slur;
Click on a handle to select it, or use <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> to cycle through the handles;
To move the <em>left and right handles</em> from note to note, use the following shortcuts:

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>: Move to next note.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd>: Move to previous note.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>: Move to lower voice (voice 2 to voice 1 etc.).

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>: Move to higher voice (voice 1 to voice 2 etc.).
To adjust the position of <em>any</em> handle, use any of the following methods:
Drag the handle.

Use the arrow keys for fine adjustment (0.1 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp.</a> at a time). 
For larger adjustments (1 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp.</a> at a time) use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>→ ← ↑ ↓</kbd></kbd>.
Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit <samp>edit mode</samp>.

<strong>Note</strong>: The two outer handles adjust the start and end of the slur, whilst the three handles on the curve adjust the contour. 
The middle handle on the straight line is used to move the whole slur up/down/left/right.
<h3>Extended slurs</h3>
A slur can span several systems and pages. 
The start and end of a slur is anchored to a note/chord or rest. 
 If the notes are repositioned due to changes in the layout, stretch or style, the slur also moves and adjusts in size.

This example shows a slur spanning from the bass to the treble clef. 
Using the mouse, select the first note of the slur, hold down <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>) and select the last note for the slur, and press <kbd><kbd>S</kbd></kbd> to add the slur.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Slur_between_2_staves_0.png?itok=Awkl7R87">
<kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> flips the direction of a selected slur.

<h3>Dotted/dashed slurs</h3>
Dotted slurs are sometimes used in songs where the presence of a slur varies between stanzas. 
Dotted slurs are also used to indicate an editor's suggestion (as opposed to the composer's original markings). 

To change an existing slur into a dotted or dashed slur, select it and then in Inspector (<kbd><kbd>F8</kbd></kbd>) change <code>Line type</code> from <code>Continuous</code> to <code>Dotted</code> or <code>Dashed</code>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Ties</span></h2>
A <strong>tie</strong> is a curved line between two notes of the <em>same</em> pitch, indicating that they are to be played as one combined note (see <a href="#external-links">external links</a> below). 
Ties are normally created between adjacent notes in the same <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a>, but MuseScore also supports ties between non-adjacent notes and between notes in different <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voices</a>.

In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">note-input mode</a>, if you specify a tie immediately after entering a note or chord, the program automatically generates the correct destination notes to go with the ties. 
Or, you can simply create ties "after the fact," between existing notes.
<strong>Note</strong>:  Ties, which join notes of the <em>same</em> pitch, should not be confused with <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs">slurs</a>, which join notes of <em>different</em> pitches and indicate <em>legato</em> articulation.

<h3>Add ties in Note Input mode</h3>
The following command adds an identical tied chord to the selected chord.
Ensure that a note is selected (i.e. 

highlighted). 
This can be a single note, or part of a chord.
Select a new <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#duration">note duration</a> for the following note(s), if required (but see "Note" below).

Press <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd> or the tie button, 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/tie_button_0.png?itok=mUyD5Tub">

.


<strong>Note</strong>: This shortcut works, as described above, only if there is no chord following the selected note. 
If there is, then the duration is ignored and the tied note is added instead to the following chord.

<h3>Add ties in Normal mode</h3>
<h4>Method 1</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more noteheads in the "<em>start</em>" chord.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/tie1_2.png?itok=qEjOiafV">

Press <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd>, or the toolbar tie button, 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/tie_button_0.png?itok=mUyD5Tub">
:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/tie2_2.png?itok=VnM8GYda">
.

Ties will be created between the selected note(s) and the next available note(s) of the same pitch.

To remove ties, as of MuseScore 3.3.3, use the same command (toggle)
<h4>Method 2</h4>
This method ties all notes in the "<em>start</em>" chord (where possible):

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the stem of the "<em>start</em>" chord;
Press <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd>, or click on the toolbar <strong>tie button</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/tie_button_0.png?itok=mUyD5Tub">
.


Ties will be created between all the notes in the selected chord and the following notes of the same pitches.
To remove ties, as of MuseScore 3.3.3, use the same command (toggle).

<h3>Add extra tied notes to a previously tied chord</h3>
Occasionally you may need to return to an existing tied chord in order to add one or more extra tied notes. 
In this case a different command is used. 

For example:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-10/add_tied_notes_1.png?itok=6xXfOaUd">

Add the extra notes to the first chord. 

e.g.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-10/add_tied_notes_2.png?itok=uMya4Fim">
In Note input mode, and with any of the notes in the first chord selected, press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd></kbd>. 
Corresponding notes are added to the following chord and the extra notes are tied:


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-10/add_tied_notes_3.png?itok=JY1OpVXr">

<h3>Add ties to unison notes</h3>
A workaround is required to create ties between unison notes:

Create the first note as usual;
Any additional unison notes should be added at an interval <em>other</em> than unison: e.g. 
2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.

Create a tied chord (as shown <a href="#add-ties-normal-mode">above</a>): e.g.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-08/unisons_1.png?itok=35G0XUtY">

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#move-notes-up-down">Move</a> the unison note(s) into position: e.g.


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-08/unisons_2.png?itok=Mecs46Or">


<h3>Flip a tie</h3>
<kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> flips the direction of a selected tie, from above the note to below the note, or vice-versa.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Tremolo</span></h2>
<strong>Tremolo</strong> is the rapid repetition of one note or chord, or a rapid alternation between two notes or chords. 

Tremolo symbols can be found in the <strong>Tremolo</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in the advanced  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>: both one note and two note tremolos are possible.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/tremolo_palette_en.PNG?itok=BKxja4V1">

A <strong>one-note or one-chord tremolo</strong> is indicated by strokes through the stem of the note or chord (or above/below if a whole note). 

E.g.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/tremolo_1.png?itok=4xzdGYwz">
In a <strong>two-note or two-chord tremolo</strong>, bars are drawn between the notes. 
E.g.


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/tremolo_2.png?itok=S-C5fUyH">

Tremolo symbols are also used to notate drum rolls.
<h3>Add a Tremolo</h3>
<h4>Single note/chord tremolo</h4>
If a single note, select that note; if a chord, select any note in the chord;
Click the desired symbol in the Tremolo palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Alternatively, you can drag the tremolo symbol onto the applicable note.
<h4>Two note/chord tremolo</h4>
Input the notes at half the desired final duration;

If a single note, select the first note of the pair; if a chord, select any note from the first chord;
Click the desired symbol in the Tremolo palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).


Alternatively, you can drag the tremolo symbol onto the applicable note.
<strong>Example</strong>: To enter a two-note tremolo with the duration of a half note (minim), enter two normal quarter notes (crotchets). 
After applying a tremolo symbol to the first note, the note values automatically double to half notes.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Tuplets</span></h2>
<strong>Tuplets</strong> are used to write rhythms beyond the beat divisions usually permitted by the time signature. 

For example, a <em>triplet</em> consists of three notes in the time of two:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/triplet.png?itok=YVx94X3U">
And a <em>duplet</em> consists of two notes in the time of three:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/duplet.png?itok=q6r7BQhc">


<h3>Create a tuplet</h3>
The exact method of tuplet entry depends on whether you are starting off in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">Note input mode</a> or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>. 
We'll start off with a simple example: the creation of an eighth note triplet.

<h4>Create a triplet in normal mode</h4>
Select a note or rest that specifies the full duration of the desired triplet group. 
In the case of an eighth note triplet, you will need to select a quarter note or rest—as in the example below:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/tuplet1_1.png?itok=gAGOd9EY">

Press the keyboard shortcut for a triplet, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd>); alternatively use the menu, <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Tuplets</samp>→<samp>Triplet</samp>. 
This will give the following result:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/tuplet2_1.png?itok=zs2r0mU-">
The program automatically changes to note-input mode and selects the most appropriate duration—in this example an eighth note. 
Now enter the desired series of notes/rests. 
For example:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/tuplet3_1.png?itok=B5tvp3ts">


<h4>Create a triplet in note input mode</h4>
Ensure you are in note input mode (press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>).
Navigate to the note/rest (or blank measure) where you want the triplet to start (use the left/right arrow keys as required).
Select a final duration for the whole triplet group. 

In the case of an eighth note triplet, click on the quarter note in the note input toolbar (or press <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd> on the keyboard).
Press the keyboard shortcut for a tuplet, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd>); alternatively, use the menu, <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Tuplets</samp>→<samp>Triplet</samp>. 
This creates a triplet number/bracket and appropriately divides the original note/rest (see image above).

The program automatically selects the most appropriate duration—in this example an eighth note—allowing you to immediately start entering the desired series of notes/rests.

<h4>Create other tuplets</h4>
To create other tuplets substitute one of the following commands at the relevant step above:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2–9</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>2–9</kbd></kbd>). 
2 for a duplet, 3 for a triplet etc.

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Tuplets</samp>, then click on the desired option.
For more complex cases, see <a href="#custom-tuplets">below</a>.
<h4>Custom tuplets</h4>
To create other tuplets than the default options (e.g. 
13 sixteenth notes in the space of one quarter note):
In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">Note input mode</a>, select a note duration equaling the total duration of the tuplet; or, if in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>, select a note or rest of the desired overall duration;

Open the <strong>Create Tuplet</strong> dialog from the menu: <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Tuplets</samp>→<samp>Other...</samp>;
Select the desired number ratio (e.g. 
13/4 for thirteen sixteenth notes in the space of a quarter note) under "Relation" in the "Type" section. 

Specify "Number" and "Bracket" using the radio buttons in the "Format" section;
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/create_tuplet_en_0.png?itok=jZZ-qQ46">
Click <kbd><kbd>OK</kbd></kbd> to close the dialog:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/thirteen-tuplet_0.png?itok=rK5ukSCZ">
Enter the desired series of notes/rests.


<h4>Triplet examples</h4>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-11/Triplets_en.png?itok=E5ke4dyW">
<h3>Delete a tuplet</h3>
Use either of the following:
Select the number or bracket and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.
Select the entire tuplet, using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#shift-click-selection">shift + click method</a>, then press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.

Select any element of the tuplet, then in Inspector, in the bottom right corner, press the Tuplet button, then press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.
<h3>Change display of tuplets</h3>
<h4>Using the Inspector</h4>
To change the display properties of tuplets in the score, select the tuplet numbers/brackets, and adjust the desired properties in the "Tuplet" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/inspector_tuplet_en.PNG?itok=CCJwJdq_">

<strong>Direction</strong>: 'Auto' places the bracket/number in the <em>default</em> position. 

'Up' <em>always</em> places the bracket <em>above</em> the note heads; 'Down' <em>always</em> places the bracket <em>below</em> the note heads.
<strong>Number type</strong>: Choice of 'Number', 'Ratio', or 'Nothing'.
<strong>Bracket type</strong>: 'Automatic' <em>hides</em> the bracket for beamed notes and <em>shows</em> the bracket if the tuplet includes unbeamed notes or rests. 

'Bracket' displays the bracket. 
'None' hides the bracket.
<h4>Using the Tuplets Style dialog</h4>
To make fine adjustments to the way that <em>all</em> tuplets in the score are displayed: from the menu, select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-tuplets">Tuplets</a></samp>.
The legend below illustrates some of the properties that can be adjusted in the Tuplets style dialog:

<h2><br><span class="orange">Repeats and jumps</span></h2>
<h3>Simple repeats</h3>
You can create a <strong>simple repeat</strong> by placing a <strong>start</strong> and an <strong>end repeat</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/barlines">barline</a> at the beginning and end of a passage. 
These can be applied from the <em>Barlines</em> or <em>Repeats &amp; Jumps</em> palette.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-10/simple_repeat_0.png?itok=Td0jkjsw">


<strong>Note</strong>: If the start of a repeat coincides with the <em>beginning</em> of a piece or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section</a>, the start repeat barline can be omitted if desired. 
Similarly, an end repeat barline can be omitted at the <em>end</em> of a score or section.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-10/simple_repeat_start_0.png?itok=KHNcWi85">


<h3>1st and 2nd endings</h3>
First create a simple repeat (as shown above), then apply the first and second time endings—see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Voltas</a>.
<h3>Playback</h3>
<h4>Turn repeat playback on/off</h4>
Toggle the "Play Repeats" 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Button-Play_Repeats.png?itok=fZc-ASP1">
button on the toolbar.

<h4>Adjust repeat section playback</h4>
<a href="#simple-repeats">Simple repeats</a>, such as the ones illustrated above, or "1, 2" volta sections, usually play back correctly first time. 
More complex repeats may need further adjustment as follows:

Ensure that the start and end barlines are correctly positioned. 
For a volta section, ensure that each volta, except the last one, terminates with an end repeat barline.
<strong>In the case of a simple repeat</strong>, where more than one repeat is needed, right-click on the measure containing the end repeat barline and select <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#properties">Measure properties</a>. 

Adjust <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#play-count">Play count</a> so that it is equal to the number of times you want the section to play back.
<strong>In the case of a complex volta section</strong>, such as the following:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-04/volta_example.png?itok=qujDIBsk">




Make sure that the volta "Repeat list" is set up correctly—see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas#volta-properties">Volta properties</a>. 
Right-click on the measure containing the end repeat barline and select <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#properties">Measure properties</a>. 

Adjust <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#play-count">Play count</a> so that it is one greater than the number of measures listed in the Volta "Repeat list." In this case, since 5 measures are listed, the "Play count" needs to be set to 6.
<h3>Repeat symbols and text</h3>
Text and symbols related to repeats are located in the "<strong>Repeats &amp; Jumps</strong>" <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (in the Basic and Advanced workspaces). 

This palette contains:
Symbols for measure repeat, Segno, Segno Variation (Serpent), Coda, and Coda Variation (Codetta)
D.S., D.C., al Coda, al Fine, To Coda, and Fine text

Repeat barlines
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-08/Palette-Repeats.png?itok=ZPZqSavi">

To add a <strong>repeat</strong> symbol to the score use either of the following:

Select a measure, then click the desired repeat symbol in the palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop a repeat symbol from the palette <em>onto</em> (not above!) the desired measure (so the measure changes color).
<h3>Jumps</h3>
<strong>Jumps</strong> are symbols in the score which tell the musician to skip to a named <a href="#markers">marker</a> (see below). 
Jumps include the various kinds of D.C. 
(Da Capo) and D.S. 

(Dal Segno) text.
To set correct playback of jumps:
Make sure that the "Play Repeats" 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Button-Play_Repeats.png?itok=fZc-ASP1">

button on the toolbar is selected. 
This is a toggle, so you can turn off playback by clicking the same button.

<em>After</em> the jump, and following established convention, only the last round of any simple repeat section is played back. 
If you want playback to take these repeats in full:
Select the applicable jump symbol;

In the "Jump" section of the Inspector, check "Play Repeats".
<strong>Note</strong>: Jumps are taken only after all simple repeats in the section are played through.
If you click on a <em>jump</em>, some text boxes and a checkbox are displayed in the <strong>Jump</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 

These have the following effects on playback:
<strong>Jump to</strong>: Playback jumps to the <a href="#markers">marker</a> whose "Label" is the same as the "Jump to" tag.
<strong>Play until</strong>: Playback continues until it reaches a <a href="#markers">marker</a> whose "Label" is the same as the "Play until" tag.

<strong>Continue at</strong>: Playback jumps to the next <a href="#markers">marker</a>  whose "Label" is the same as the "Continue" tag.
<strong>Play repeats</strong>: Ticking this box tells MuseScore to play repeats after D.C. 
(Da Capo) or D.S. 

(Dal Segno) jumps. 
If this option is not ticked then <a href="#simple-repeats">simple Repeats</a> are not taken after jumps and playback works as if it were the last repeat.
<strong>Note</strong>: The tags <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>, referring to the beginning and end of a score or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section</a>, are <em>implicit</em> and don't need to be added by the user.

<h3>Markers</h3>
<strong>Markers</strong> are the places referred to by the <a href="#jumps">jumps</a>. 
A list of markers (in addition to the implicit "start" and "end") follows:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/dal_segno.png?itok=eUdzvtHs">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/dal_segno_var.png?itok=O4AeH7kk">

: Segno Variation (tag: <em>varsegno</em>)

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/coda.png?itok=6QScxuYE">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/coda_var.png?itok=AF5Pq-85">
: Coda Variation (tag: <em>varcoda</em>)

<strong>Fine</strong>: (tag: <em>fine</em>)
<strong>To Coda</strong>: (tag: <em>coda</em>)
If you click on a marker, the following properties appears in the <strong>Marker</strong> section of the Inspector:

<strong>Marker type</strong>: This can be changed from the dropdown list, if required.
<strong>Label</strong>: This is the (identifier) tag associated with the marker. 
See also, <a href="#jumps">Jumps</a> (above).

<h3>Examples of jumps</h3>
<strong>Da Capo (D.C.)</strong>: At the "D.C." sign, playback jumps to the start (i.e. 
to the implicit <em>start</em> tag) and plays the entire score or section again (i.e. 

up to the implicit <em>end</em> tag).
<strong>Da Capo (D.C.) al Fine</strong>: At the "D.C. 
al Fine" sign, playback jumps to the start (i.e. 

to the implicit <em>start</em> tag) and plays the score up to the <strong>Fine</strong> (i.e. 
the <em>fine</em> tag).
<strong>Dal Segno (D.S.) al Fine</strong>: At the "D.S. 

al Fine" sign, playback jumps to the <strong>Segno</strong> symbol (i.e. 
the <em>segno</em> tag) and then plays up to the <strong>Fine</strong> (i.e. 
the <em>fine</em> tag)

<strong>Dal Segno (D.S.) al Coda</strong>: At the "D.S. 
al Coda" sign, playback jumps to the <strong>Segno</strong> symbol (i.e. 
the <em>segno</em> tag) and then plays up to the <strong>To Coda</strong> (i.e. 

the <em>coda</em> tag). 
Playback then continues at the <strong>Coda</strong> symbol (i.e. 
the <em>codab</em> tag).

<strong>Note</strong>: The properties (i.e. 
the tag names) of jumps and markers can be set via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-02/multiple%20jumps.png?itok=2g5UU1L_">

<h2><br><span class="orange">Voltas</span></h2>
Volta brackets, or first and second ending brackets, are <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">lines</a> used to mark different endings for a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/repeats-and-jumps#simple-repeats">simple repeat</a>. 

Score playback automatically follows the repeat indications.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/volta_5.png?itok=tYM1pt-m">
<h3>To add a volta to the score</h3>
Use one of the following methods:

Select a measure, or range of measures and click a Volta icon in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">Lines palette</a> (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag-and-drop a volta from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">Lines palette</a>, then adjust the length as required (see below).
<h3>To change the number of measures that a volta covers</h3>
Go  into <samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">Edit mode</a></samp> on the volta. 
The end handle is automatically selected.
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle <em>forward</em> one measure. 

Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the handle <em>backward</em> one measure. 
Repeat as required.
<strong>Note</strong>: When you select a start or end handle, a dashed line appears connecting it to an <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#anchor">anchor</a> point on the staff (see diagram, below). 

This anchor shows the position of the <em>playback</em> start/end points of the Volta. 
The <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> commands change the anchor point so playback always remains in sync with the <em>visual</em> start/end points. 
To make fine adjustments to the <em>visual</em> start or end points, without affecting playback, use other keyboard arrow <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#keyboard-shortcuts">commands</a>, or drag the handles with a mouse.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/volta2_3.png?itok=FLh892Df">

<h3>Volta properties</h3>
<strong>To make changes to Volta text</strong>:

Select the volta, and edit the properties in the <strong>Text Line Core</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/volta_text_line_core.png?itok=YdTsQtan">

<strong>To specify the order of repeats</strong>:

Select the volta, and in "Repeat list" (<strong>Volta</strong> section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>)  type in a number, or sequence of numbers separated by commas, to indicate the repeat(s) in which the volta is to be played.
For example, a <strong>first ending</strong> shows the number "1"; a <strong>second ending</strong>, the number "2" and so on. 
More complex repeats are also possible: e.g. 

a "Repeat list" displaying "1, 2, 4, 5, 7" indicates that the volta is to be played during repeats 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, and so on.
<strong>Note</strong>: Each volta section, except the final one, should end with an <strong>end repeat</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/barlines">barline</a>.
<strong>Note</strong>: Keep in mind that the repeat is always referenced in comparison to it's starting point (either the most recent start repeat barline or the start of the current section).

<h3>Playback</h3>
Sometimes a repeat plays more than two times. 
If you want to change the number of times MuseScore plays a repeat, go to the measure containing the end repeat barline and change its "Play count". 

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#other">Measure operations: Other properties</a> and the note on playback for voltas in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/repeats-and-jumps#playback">Repeats and jumps</a>.
<h4>Play count</h4>
The play count of the measure with the end repeat barline must be set one higher than the number of times you want the measure to play (this is usually equal to the number of entries in that volta repeat list + 1).

Take the following score:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-06/repeats%2Bvoltas.png?itok=z8Bg2TJC, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-06/repeats%2Bvoltas.png?itok=qh09CF3I 2x">

<h2><br><span class="orange">Transposition</span></h2>
<strong>Transposition</strong> is the act of raising or lowering the pitch of a selection of notes by the same <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#interval">interval</a>. 

You can choose to transpose notes either <a href="#manual-transpose">manually</a> or by using the <a href="#automatic-transpose">Transpose dialog</a>.
<h3>Manual transposition</h3>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the notes that you wish to transpose;

Use any of the following options:
<strong>To transpose chromatically</strong> (i.e. 
one semitone at a time): Press <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>. 

Repeat as required.
<strong>To transpose diatonically</strong> (i.e. 
one scale degree at a time): Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>. 

Repeat as required.
<strong>To transpose by an octave</strong>: Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>).


<h3>Automatic transposition</h3>
MuseScore's  <strong>Transpose</strong>  dialog gives you more options for transposing notes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-01/transpose_dialog_en.png?itok=dpSIo7NP">
<strong>Note</strong>: By default this dialog opens from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, but you can also choose to open it using a keyboard shortcut (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">Preferences</a>).

<h4>Transpose Chromatically</h4>
<h5>To Key</h5>
To transpose notes up or down to the desired key:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the notes you want to transpose; no selection equals "select all.".
From the menu bar, choose <samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Transpose…</samp>.
Tick "Transpose Chromatically" and "To key".

Tick/untick "Transpose key signature" and "Transpose chord symbols" if required
Tick one of "Closest", "Up" or "Down" and select a destination key signature from the drop-down menu.
Click OK.

<h5>By Interval</h5>
To transpose selected notes up or down in semitone increments:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the notes you want to transpose; no selection equals "select all".

From the menu bar, choose <samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Transpose…</samp>.
Tick "Transpose Chromatically" and "By Interval".
Tick/untick "Transpose key signature" and "Transpose chord symbols" if required.

Tick "Up" or "Down"; and select a transposition interval from the drop-down menu.
Click OK.


<h4>Transpose Diatonically</h4>
To transpose selected notes up or down by a diatonic interval:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the notes you want to transpose; no selection equals "select all".

From the menu bar, choose <samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Transpose…</samp>.

<h4>Options</h4>
Two options are available for both Chromatic and Diatonic transposition mode in the options area:
<strong>Transpose chord symbols</strong>, if required.

And the choice of <strong>Use Double  and </strong> or <strong>Single  and  Only</strong>
<h3>Transposing instruments</h3>
<strong>Transposing instruments</strong>, such as the B-flat trumpet or E-flat alto sax, sound lower, or higher than their written pitch. 

MuseScore has a number of features to facilitate the scoring of these instruments.
<h4>Concert pitch</h4>
MuseScore's default viewing mode shows the musical notation in <strong>written pitch</strong>, but you can choose to display the score in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/concert-pitch">concert pitch</a> instead. 

In the latter mode, the musical notation of <em>all</em> instruments matches the actual pitches that you hear on playback.
<strong>To change the view to concert pitch</strong>: Press the <kbd><samp class="button"><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/concert-pitch">Concert Pitch</a></samp></kbd> button to highlight it.
You should ensure that the Concert pitch button is OFF before printing the main score or any parts.

<h4>Change staff transposition</h4>
Instrument transpositions are already set up in MuseScore. 
However, if you want a rare instrument or transposition that is not available in MuseScore, you may need to edit the instrument transposition manually.

Right-click an empty part of the instrument staff and select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>.
At the bottom of the window, select the interval of transposition, any octave shifts, and whether the interval is "Up" (sounds higher than written) or "Down" (sounds lower than written).
You can also use the <kbd><samp class="button">Change Instrument…</samp></kbd> button in the Staff/Part Properties window to automatically change the transposition to that of a different standard instrument.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Drum notation</span></h2>

Entering percussion notation is somewhat different to entering notation for pitched instruments (such as the piano or violin).
<h3>Percussion staff types</h3>
When you create a percussion staff using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a> or the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#change-Instrument-setup">Instruments</a> dialog, MuseScore automatically chooses the most appropriate staff type (1-, 3-, or 5-line) for the instrument: this can be changed, if required, using the "Staff type" column on the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Choose instruments / Instruments</a> page. 

Any additional changes (e.g. 
to a 2-line staff) can be made from the score itself (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#advanced-style-properties">Advanced Style Properties</a>).
On a 5-line percussion staff, each instrument is assigned a vertical staff position (line or space) and a notehead shape. 

For a drumset, one or two <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voices</a> can be used. 
If the latter, <strong>voice 1</strong> (the upper voice) usually contains (up-stem) notes played by the hands while <strong>voice 2</strong> (the lower voice) usually contains (down-stem) notes played by the feet (see image below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/drum1_3.png?itok=2E4oVn_X">


<h3>Note input methods</h3>
You can add notes to a percussion staff from any of the following:
External MIDI keyboard;

Piano keyboard (virtual);
Computer keyboard;
Mouse.

These methods can be used in any desired combination:
<h4>MIDI keyboard</h4>
To add notes to a percussion staff from a <strong>MIDI keyboard</strong>:

Ensure that the MIDI keyboard is connected and functioning correctly.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you click on the percussion staff without entering <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input">note input</a> mode, you can <em>demo</em> the percussion instruments from the MIDI keyboard.
Click on the note or rest where you want to start.

Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input">note input</a> mode.
Select the correct <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a>. 
For example, snares, sidesticks and all cymbals are normally added to voice 1; bass drum to voice 2.

Set <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#duration">note duration</a>.
Press an instrument key to add a note to the score. 
To add another note at the same position, keep the first key held down while pressing the second key.


<strong>Note</strong>: Refer to a <strong>GM2 drum map</strong> for details about which MIDI keyboard key corresponds to which percussion instrument. 
Some keyboards (e.g., Casio) display percussion symbols next to the keys as an aid to the user.

<h4>Piano keyboard</h4>
To add notes to a percussion staff from the virtual <strong>Piano Keyboard</strong>:
Ensure that the Piano keyboard is displayed. 

Press <kbd><kbd>P</kbd></kbd> (or select it from the menu, <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Piano Keyboard</samp>).
<strong>Note</strong>: If you click on the percussion staff without entering <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input">note input</a> mode, you can <em>demo</em> the percussion instruments from the Piano keyboard.

Click on a (virtual piano) key to add a note to the score.
To add another note to an existing one, press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and hold it while pressing the new note (in versions before 2.1, use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>)).

<strong>Note</strong>: Refer to a <strong>GM2 drum map</strong> for details about which piano key corresponds to which percussion instrument.
By default, the piano keyboard is docked at the bottom of the screen—to the left of the Drum input palette. 
However you can undock it by dragging, then dock the panel in several ways:

Drag the panel downwards to the center and it will overlay the Drum input palette, full length. 
Both panels can then be accessed by Tabs.
Drag the panel downwards to the right/left and it will dock to the right/left of the Drum input palette.

<h4>Computer keyboard</h4>
To enter notes on a percussion staff using your computer keyboard:
Click on the note or rest where you want to start.

Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input">note input</a> mode. 
The <a href="#drum-input-palette">Drum input palette</a> now appears at the bottom of the screen (see <a href="#drum-input-palette">below</a>).

Bass drum, or Snare) in the <a href="#drum-input-palette">Drum input palette</a>, then click a note or rest in the score.

<em>To add a note to an existing chord in the percussion staff</em>

Ensure you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">note input mode</a>.
Select a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#duration">note duration</a> equal to the note you are adding to.
Click on the new note in the <a href="#drum-input-palette">Drum input palette</a>.

Click above or below the existing note in the percussion staff.

<strong>Note</strong>: Voice allocation is determined by the color of the note in the drum input palette: blue for voice 1, green for voice 2.

<h3>Drum input palette</h3>
When a percussion staff is selected and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input">note input</a> mode is ON, a window opens at the bottom of the screen called the <strong>Drum input palette</strong>. 
This window is <em>essential</em> for <a href="#mouse">mouse</a> input, and displays shortcuts for <a href="#computer-keyboard">computer keyboard</a> input, but can be ignored if using a <a href="#midi-keyboard">MIDI keyboard</a> or the virtual <a href="#piano-keyboard">Piano Keyboard</a>.

Each note in the palette represents a percussion instrument: hovering the mouse pointer over the note displays the instrument name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Drum_input_tool_en.png?itok=M8e0c4XI, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Drum_input_tool_en.png?itok=DH3lBx2I 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/Drum_input_tool_en.png?itok=wABrNL3j">


The letters A–G (shown above certain notes in the palette) are designated as shortcuts for entering particular instruments (bass drum, snare, closed hi-hat etc.), rather than referring to note pitches. 
They can be changed or reallocated as desired in the <a href="#drumset">Edit Drumset</a> window.
When the <strong>Drum input palette</strong> is open, double-clicking a note in the palette or entering a shortcut letter will add that instrument note to the percussion staff. 

The color of the note in the palette shows the voice allocated for that note—blue for voice 1, green for voice 2. 
This can be changed in the <a href="#drumset">Edit Drumset</a> dialog if required.
This voice allocation applies only to keyboard and mouse entry of notes: entry via a MIDI keyboard or the virtual Piano keyboard allows any voice to be used.

<h3>Edit Drumset</h3>
To open the <strong>Edit Drumset</strong> window, use one of the following options:
Click on the <kbd><samp class="button">Edit Drumset</samp></kbd> button at the left of the <strong>Drum input palette</strong>.

Right-click on a percussion staff and select "Edit Drumset...".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/edit_drumset_en.png?itok=ZVJHSfEu">
The <strong>Edit Drumset</strong> dialog displays the percussion instruments available and the MIDI notes/numbers to which they are allocated. 
It also determines how each instrument is displayed on the staff— its name, position, notehead type and note-stem direction. 

<em>Any changes made here are automatically saved in the parent MuseScore file</em>.
Clicking on a row in the left-hand column allows you to edit the display properties for that note as follows:
<strong>Name</strong>: The name you want displayed in the Drum input palette when you mouse over the note. 

Leave empty to remove this note from the Drum input palette.
<strong>Notehead group</strong>: Choose a notehead for that instrument from a drop-down list of options (<em>Note</em>: choosing "Custom" activates "Edit noteheads" (below).
<strong>Edit Noteheads</strong>: Allows you to customize the display further by specifying the noteheads for particular note durations.
<strong>Default voice</strong>: Assign to one of four voices. 
This does not affect input from a MIDI keyboard or the virtual Piano keyboard.
<strong>Staff line</strong>: This number indicates the staff line/space on which the note is displayed. 
"0" means that the note is displayed on the top line of the 5-line staff. 

Negative numbers move the note upwards step by step, while positive numbers move it downwards in the same way.
<strong>Shortcut</strong>: Assign a keyboard shortcut to enter that note.
<strong>Stem Direction</strong>: Auto, Up or down.
The customized drumset can be saved as a .drm file by pressing <kbd><samp class="button">Save As...</samp></kbd>. 
You can also import a customized drumset using the <kbd><samp class="button">Load...</samp></kbd> button.

<h3>Sticking</h3>
To enter sticking symbols (R, L):
Select a start note;

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>→<samp>Sticking</samp>. 
Alternatively, set up a keyboard shortcut to do the same thing in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">Preferences</a>;
Input the symbol just as you would normal text. 

To move forward or backwards to the next note, use the same keyboard shortcuts as for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols#commands">chord symbols</a>.
To exit, press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>, or click on a blank section of the score.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Tablature</span></h2>
Music for fretted, stringed instruments is commonly notated using <strong>tablature</strong>, also known as <strong>tab</strong>, which provides a visual representation of the strings and fret numbers:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/freight_train_tab_0.png?itok=M9jaDhwJ">

Tablature can also be combined with traditional staff notation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/freight_train_0.png?itok=DIUgWHRj">
<h3>Create a new tablature staff</h3>
If you wish to create tablature as part of a new score, use the <a href="#with-the-new-score-wizard">New Score Wizard</a>. 
If you want to add tablature to an existing score, use the <a href="#with-the-instruments-dialog">Instruments</a> dialog. 
Or, alternatively, you can <a href="#by-changing-staff-type">convert an existing standard staff</a>. 

See below for details.
<h4>With the New Score wizard</h4>
To create tablature in a new score (for combined staff/tablature systems see → <a href="#multiple-staves">below</a>):

Open the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score wizard</a>.
Enter the score details (optional). 
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Next</samp></kbd>.

On the <strong>Choose template file</strong> page, click on <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Choose Instruments</a> under "General".
On the <strong>Instruments</strong> page, select the desired tablature in the "Strings – plucked" category, in the left-hand column. 
Then click <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd>.

Complete the rest of the New Score Wizard.

<strong>Note</strong>: If the desired tablature is not available in the <strong>Choose Instrument</strong> list, add a tablature staff anyway at step 4 (above). 

Then edit the tablature to your exact requirements using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff/Part properties</a> dialog.
<h4>With the Instruments dialog</h4>
To add a single tablature staff to an existing score (for combined staff/tab system see <a href="#multiple-staves">below</a>):

Open the <strong>instruments</strong> dialog (press <kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd>; or from the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Instruments…</samp>).
Click on the staff to which you want to add another (linked or not).
Add the tab staff as described in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#add-instruments">Add instruments</a> ("Create a new score").


<h4>By changing staff type</h4>
To convert an existing standard staff to tablature, or tablature to a standard staff:

Right-click on the staff and select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>. 
If "Instrument" is already set to a plucked-strings type, then go to step 3.
If  "Instrument" is not a plucked-strings type, click on <kbd><samp class="button">Change instrument</samp></kbd> and select an appropriate instrument from "Strings – Plucked."

Click on <kbd><samp class="button">Advanced Style properties</samp></kbd>, select the appropriate tablature option from "Template", then press <kbd><samp class="button">&lt; Reset to Template</samp></kbd>. 
You can fine tune the display if necessary using the "Fret Marks" and "Note Values" tabs.
Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd> twice to exit.


<h3>Edit string data</h3>
<h4>Change tuning</h4>
<em>Note</em>: If you only want to <strong>view</strong> (rather than change) the instrument tuning, follow steps 1 and 2 only.
Right-click on the staff and select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/staff_properties_en.png?itok=dDCTMtwn">


Press the <kbd><samp class="button">Edit String Data…</samp></kbd> button at the bottom of the dialog box. 
The <strong>String Data</strong> dialog opens:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/String%20data_en.png?itok=okfW8Q8O">


Click on a string pitch and select <kbd><samp class="button">Edit String…</samp></kbd>. 
Or, alternatively, just double-click the string pitch.
Select a new pitch in the <strong>Note Selection</strong> box and click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd>. 

Or, alternatively, just double-click the new pitch.
Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd> to close the "<strong>String Data</strong>" dialog box. 
Then click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd> to close the <strong>"Staff/Part Properties"</strong> dialog.


<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) If tuning is changed when the tablature for that instrument already contains some notes, fret marks will be adjusted automatically  (if possible); (2) Any change of tuning to a particular instrument applies <em>only</em> to the score at hand, and does not change any program default settings.
<h4>Add a string</h4>
Right-click on the staff, select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>, then press <kbd><samp class="button">Edit String Data</samp></kbd>.
Click on a string pitch and select <kbd><samp class="button">New String...</samp></kbd>.
Select the new pitch and press <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd>—or, alternatively, just double-click the new pitch. 

The new string is inserted <em>below</em> the selected string.
<strong>Note</strong>: After adding a tablature string you will need to adjust the number of lines in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff/Part properties</a> dialog.
<h4>Delete a string</h4>
Right-click on the staff, select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>, then press <kbd><samp class="button">Edit String Data</samp></kbd>.
Click on a string pitch and select <kbd><samp class="button">Delete String</samp></kbd>.
<strong>Note</strong>: After deleting a tablature string you will need to adjust the number of lines in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff/Part properties</a> dialog.

<h4>Mark unfretted string "open"</h4>
This feature is used to mark a (bass) course as unstopped (i.e. 
like a harp string, only played in the open position): as on a Baroque lute or Theorbo etc. 

This means that only "0" (zero) or "a" is accepted as a fret mark: any other fret mark will be converted to 0/a.
Right-click on the staff, select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>, then press <kbd><samp class="button">Edit String Data</samp></kbd>.
Check one or more boxes in the "Open" column.

<h4>Change number of instrument frets</h4>
This property defines the maximum fret number which can be entered on a tablature staff.
Right-click on the staff, select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>, then press <kbd><samp class="button">Edit String Data</samp></kbd>.

Select or enter a new number in the "<strong>Number of frets</strong>" spin box.
<h3>Change tablature display</h3>
<h4>From Staff / Part Properties</h4>
To access the full range of tablature display options, use the <strong>Staff / Parts Properties</strong> dialog:
Right-click on the staff and select <samp>Staff/Part Properties…</samp>.
Click on the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#advanced-style-properties">Advanced Style Properties…</a> button.


<h4>From the Instruments dialog</h4>
Some basic tablature display options are available from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Instruments</a> dialogue:

Press the keyboard shortcut <strong>I</strong>; or from the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Instruments…</samp>.
Select a tablature type from the drop-down list under "Staff Type" in the right-hand pane:
<strong>Simple</strong>: Displays fretmarks only. 

Best for staff/tablature systems.
<strong>Common</strong>: Displays fretmarks, note stems and beams.
<strong>Full</strong>: Displays fretmarks, enhanced note stems, beams, and rests.

<strong>Tab 6 str. 
Italian</strong>/<strong>French</strong>: Historical tablature options for the lute.


The same options are available from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Choose Instruments</a> page of the New Score Wizard.
<h3>Combine pitched staff with tablature</h3>
Plucked-string instruments—such as the guitar—are commonly notated using both a music staff <em>and</em>  tablature (TAB) together. 

MuseScore gives you the option of having the two staves either <strong>unlinked</strong> or  <strong>linked</strong>:
<strong>Unlinked Staves</strong>: The advantage of using this option is that each staff can be edited independently. 
To transfer music notation from one staff to the other, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">select</a> the desired range and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">copy and paste</a> it onto the other staff.

<strong>Linked Staves</strong>: The staves are "mutually updating": i.e. 
any change you make to the notation in one staff is immediately applied to the other staff as well.


<strong>A note on fret mark conflicts</strong>:  When the same note is entered in two different voices, MuseScore tries to ensure that the fret marks do not overlap on the same string. 
Any overlaps which <em>do</em> occur are marked with red squares: these appear <em>only</em> in the document window and <em>not</em> on any printed copy. 
In almost all cases (e.g. 

frets 0 to 4 on the 6th string), overlapping is the desired result and no further adjustment is required. 
You can hide the red marks by selecting "View" and unticking "Show Unprintable."
<h4>Create a <em>new</em> staff/tablature pair with the New Score Wizard</h4>
Open the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score wizard</a>.
Enter the score details (optional). 
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Next</samp></kbd>.

On the <strong>Choose template file</strong> page, click on <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Choose Instruments</a> under "General".
Select a music staff (not tab) in the "Strings – Plucked" section of the left-hand column. 
Then click <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd>.

In the right-hand column, click on the newly-created line, labelled "Staff 1". 
This reveals the "Add Staff/Linked Staff" options in the centre column:
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Staff</samp></kbd> to create an <strong>unlinked</strong> staff/tab pair.

Click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Linked Staff</samp></kbd> to create a <strong>linked</strong> staff/tab pair.
In the <strong>Staff type</strong> column, click on the dropdown list for the newly-created staff and select a tablature option (this can be modified later, if required, on the score page—see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff/Part Properties</a>).
Change the staff order using the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> button if needed.

Complete the rest of the New Score Wizard, or click <kbd><samp class="button">Finish</samp></kbd>.

<em>Note</em>: To create unlinked staves with <em>separate</em> mixer channels, instead of step "5" (above), select a Tablature staff in the left-hand column and click <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd>. 

Then continue with steps 6 and 7.
<h4>Create a <em>new</em> staff/tablature pair in an existing score</h4>
Open the <strong>Instruments</strong> editor (press <kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd>, or from the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Instruments…</samp>).

Then follow steps 4–8 above.
<h4>Create a staff/tablature pair from an existing staff</h4>
To add tablature to a plucked-string staff in the score (or vice versa):

Open the <strong>Instruments</strong> editor (press <kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd>, or from the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Instruments…</samp>).
In the right-hand column, select the staff you want to create the staff/tab pair from, then follow one of the options shown in step 5 above.
Continue with steps 6–8 above.


<h3>Enter notes in tablature</h3>
<h4>Using a computer keyboard</h4>
In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>, select the measure or existing note from which you want to begin note entry.
Switch to note input mode (<kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>): a short 'blue rectangle' appears around one tablature string: this is the <em>current string</em>.
Select the duration of the note or rest that you wish to enter  (see <a href="#select-note_duration">below</a>).

Press the up/down arrow keys to move the cursor to the desired string. 
Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate through the score.
Press <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd> to enter a fret mark from 0 to 9 on the current string; to enter numbers with several digits press each digit in sequence. 

 Keys <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>K</kbd></kbd> (skipping <kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd>) can also be used: convenient when working in French tablature. 
For <kbd><kbd>L</kbd></kbd> , <kbd><kbd>M</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>, use the alphanumeric keyboard  and type respectively <kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd></kbd>... 
(<strong>Note</strong>: You cannot enter a number higher than the "Number of frets" value set in the <a href="#change-number-of-frets">Edit String Data</a> dialog).

Press <kbd><kbd>;</kbd></kbd> (semicolon) to enter a rest of the selected duration.
You can enter notes in different <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voices</a> if required—just as you would in a standard staff.


See also, <a href="#edit-notes">Edit notes</a> (below).
<h5>Historical tablature</h5>
Period notation for bass strings (lutes and sim.) is supported:

<strong>French tablature</strong>: letters with prefixed slash-like strokes right under the tab body: i.e. 
7th string: "a", 8th string: "/a", 9th string: "//a" and so on, all in the first position below the tab body.
<strong>Italian tablature</strong>: numbers with 'ledger line'- like segment of string above the tab body: i.e. 

7th string: "0" one position above the tab body with one 'ledger line'; 8th string: "0" two positions above the tab body with two 'ledger lines' and so on.
Input of fretmarks is via computer keyboard only: by moving the note entry cursor below (French) or above (Italian) the tab body, 'shadow' slashes or ledger lines will indicate the target string to which the fret mark will be applied; pressing one of the fret keys, will enter (and lay out) the note on that string.
<h4>Using a mouse</h4>
To enter notes into tablature with a mouse:
Enter note input mode and select the note or rest duration (see <a href="#select-note_duration">below</a>).
Click on a string to create a note there. 

Notes are initially created on fret 0 (or <em>a</em> for French tablatures): to correct, type in the right number from the keyboard.
You can also increase/decrease the fret mark using <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>.
You can enter notes in different <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/2/voices">voices</a> if required—just as you would in a standard staff.

See also, <a href="#edit-notes">Edit notes</a> (below).
<h4>Select note duration</h4>
In note input mode, you can use any of the following methods to set note duration in tablature:

Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd>: Sets duration from a 128th note to a longa (availability of these shortcuts may depend on the platform and/or keyboard layout);
Press <kbd><kbd>NumPad</kbd><kbd>1</kbd></kbd> to <kbd><kbd>NumPad</kbd><kbd>9</kbd></kbd>: Sets  duration from a 128th note to a longa (if a numeric keypad exists and <kbd><kbd>NumLock</kbd></kbd> is on);
Click on a note duration icon in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note Input toolbar</a> above the document window;

Press <kbd><kbd>Q</kbd></kbd> to decrease the selected duration and <kbd><kbd>W</kbd></kbd> to increase it.
<h3>Edit notes</h3>
<h4>Change fret number</h4>
<em>In Note input mode</em>:
Position the cursor above the fret mark and retype the desired number.
Increment or decrement the fret mark using <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (The fret mark automatically changes strings, if necessary, to achieve the lowest possible fret position).

<em>In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#normal-mode">Normal mode</a></em>:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more fret marks.
Use any of the following commands:

To increment or decrement, without changing the string: Press <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> / <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>.
To increment or decrement, changing strings, when possible, to minimize the fret number: Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> / <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>


<strong>Note</strong>: The fret mark cannot be higher than the "Number of frets" value set in the <a href="#change-number-of-frets">Edit String Data</a> dialog.
<h4>Change string number</h4>
To move the fret mark to an adjacent string without changing the pitch (if the string is free and can produce that note):

<em>In Note input mode</em>:
Position the cursor over a fret mark, and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> / <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> / <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>).
<em>In Normal mode</em>:

Select one or more fret marks, and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> / <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> / <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>).
Drag a fret mark up or down to an adjacent string.
<h4>Crosshead notes</h4>
To change a fret mark to a crosshead note:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more fret marks (in non-note-input mode).
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> to toggles ghost noteheads on/off.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Sound and playback</span></h2>
MuseScore has "Sound and playback" capabilities built-in. 
This chapter covers the playback controls and ways to extend the instrument sounds.


<b>External links</b>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/96811">How to restore sound if playback stops working</a>
<h2><br><span class="orange">Mid-staff instrument changes</span></h2>
When a musician is required to double on a different instrument for a section of a piece, the instruction to switch instruments is generally placed above the staff at the beginning of that section. 
A return to the primary instrument is handled in the same manner.

MuseScore enables users to insert a special class of text called <strong>Change Instrument</strong> text for this purpose. 
This class of text is different from either <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#staff-text">Staff</a> or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#system-text">System</a> text in that it links the text to the playback and changes the sound to the new instrument.
<h3>Effect of instrument change</h3>
When an instrument change is made:
The sound played will be changed to that of the new instrument from that point onward, but the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">mixer</a> display remains unchanged.
Subsequent notes are automatically adjusted to indicate the correct <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/concert-pitch">written pitch</a> for the new instrument (but the new <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/key-signatures#add">key signature</a> still needs to be added manually—see <a href="#add-instrument-change">below</a>).

The new instrument name will be displayed in front of the following systems.
<h3>Add an instrument change</h3>
Select the start point of the change by clicking on a note or rest;

Open the main palette by typing F9 (or from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#show-panels">View menu</a>), and click on <strong>Text</strong> to open the text sub-palette:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/Change-instrument-Text_en.png?itok=QU1REMwm">
A click on the <strong>Change Instr</strong>  text in the palette opens the dialog (double-click in versions prior to 3.4)

The top box shows the current instrument, the bottom the list of selectable instruments;


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Change-instrument-Select_en.png?itok=v9URwkQi">

Choose the instrument, then click OK. 
When an instrument is selected and the OK button is pressed, the text indicating which instrument the player will use appears in the score.

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/key-signatures#add">Insert a new key signature</a>, if required, at the change, for the staff in question.

<strong>Note</strong>: Mid-staff instrument changes are limited to the <em>same type of staff</em>. 

For example, you cannot change between a percussion staff and a pitched instrument staff or vice versa.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Mixer</span></h2>

The Mixer allows you to change instrument sounds, adjust volume and panning, and make other adjustments to the playback for each staff.
<h3>Opening the Mixer</h3>
To display/hide the mixer, use one of the following:

Press <kbd><kbd>F10</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd></kbd>).
From the main menu, select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Mixer</samp>.
The Mixer is split into a <a href="#details-area">Details Area</a> on the top and a <a href="#track-area">Track Area</a> below.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-08/mixerPanel_en.png?itok=nDzg2Om7">

<h3>Track Area</h3>
The track area is at the bottom and displays the <a href="#master-gain">Master Gain</a> as well as a row of tracks. 

The Track Area displays allows you to adjust the volume of the instruments used by your staves. 
 Clicking on one of the panels selects it, and also allows you to edit other instrument parameters, such as choice of instrument, name, pan, chorus, reverb, etc. 
in the Details area.

MuseScore creates one "part track" for each staff in your score. 
 These part tracks can be further subdivided into "channel tracks" corresponding to the different sounds used within the staff. 
 While many staves only need a single channel track, others require multiple channels so that the instrument can play more than one  <a href="#mid-staff-change">sound</a> (e.g. 

a violin which can play in arco, tremolo or pizzicato voices); or because of a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mid-staff-instrument-changes">Mid-staff instrument change</a>. 
 These extra channel tracks can be shown or hidden by clicking the arrow button on top of the track control.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-04/channelsExpanded.png?itok=lTiNyUsQ">



<em>Expanded part track, showing the child tracks in pink.</em>
<h4>Master Gain</h4>
The Master Gain controls the overall output volume. 

To adjust it, click and drag the slider handle or enter a value in the box underneath.
<h4>Channel display arrow</h4>
Every <strong>part track</strong> has a button on the top with an arrow on it, enabled, when that instrument has multiple channels, like e.g. 

violin (for arco, pizzicato, tremolo), disabled otherwise. 
 When clicked, this will toggle whether the channel tracks of the staff are displayed next to it. 
<strong>Channel tracks</strong> do not have an arrow button. 

 Instead, the name of the track they are a part of is displayed.
<h4>Mute and Solo</h4>
At the top of each track is a green <strong>solo</strong> button and a red <strong>mute</strong> button: each can be toggled on or off. 

 If any Solo button is checked then only tracks that have solo lit will play. 
 If no solo is lit, all parts can potentially play. 
 Mute does the opposite: any track that has mute lit will not play. 

 By using a combination of mute and solo buttons, you can control which instruments are heard during playback.
<h4>Pan</h4>
The dial below the mute button controls panning left and right. 

 You can click and drag on the dial to change the pan value. 
<strong>Note</strong>: MuseScore does not yet support pan values for the part track, so the part track displays the pan value of the first channel instead. 
 Setting the pan value of the part track will automatically set all of its children to the same value as well.

<h4>Volume</h4>
The slider in the middle of the track controls the playback volume. 
<strong>Note</strong>: MuseScore does not yet support volume values for the part track, so the part track displays the volume value of the first channel instead. 

 Setting the volume value of the part track will automatically set all of its children to the same value as well.
<h4>Track name</h4>
The text box at the bottom of the track contains the current name of the track's part or channel.

<h3>Details Area</h3>
The details area displays and provides finer control of the currently selected track.

<h4>Name</h4>
The name of the part this track is associated with. 
 Both part tracks and channel tracks display the part name. 

<strong>Note</strong>: The part name is editable, but this only have effect for the Mixer. 
The channel name is not editable.
<h4>Channel</h4>
If a channel track is selected, the channel name is displayed here.
<h4>Drumset</h4>
Indicates if this part represents a melodic instrument or a drumkit. 

For regular melodic instruments, each pitch in the same patch usually has the same timbre, while drumkit patches usually have different timbres for each pitch.
<h4>Sound (formerly Patch)</h4>
To change the sound in a track:

Click on the desired track so that its details appear in the <a href="details-area">Details area</a>.
Click on the "Sound" dropdown list and select another instrument.


The "Sound" drop-down menu lists every instrument supported by your current <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files">SoundFont</a>. 
If you have multiple SoundFonts loaded in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer">Synthesizer</a>, all the patches from all the SoundFonts (and/or SFZ files) will appear in the order set in the Synthesizer.
<strong>Tip</strong>: To find an instrument, click on the "Sound" list and type the first letter of the instrument name. 

Repeat as required.
<h4>Volume</h4>
The overall loudness with which the sound is played.

<h4>Pan</h4>
The panning applied to the part.
<h4>Track color</h4>
To change the change the color of the track area:
Click the colored rectangle to enter the color palette, and make the desired changes.
Setting the color of a part track will automatically change the colors of all its child tracks as well.

<h3>MIDI controls</h3>
<h4>Port and Channel</h4>
The output MIDI port and channel the part is played on.

<h4>Reverb / Chorus</h4>
The reverb/chorus value sent to MIDI out. 
 This is information sent to MIDI devices and will not affect MuseScore's built in audio playback

<h4>Mute Voice</h4>
This allows you to mute individual voices within each staff. 
 Each row represents a different staff within a part. 

 So pressing '2' on the top row will mute the second voice on the first staff of the part.
<h4>Hide Details Button</h4>
At the bottom of the detail area is a wide button with a tiny triangle on it. 

 Clicking this button will hide the detail area to give you more room. 
 Clicking on it again will restore the detail area.
<strong>Note</strong>: From Preferences &gt; Score it is possible to check the box Show MIDI controls in the Mixer to preset it expanded when opening the Mixer.

<h3>Mid-staff sound change (pizz., con sordino, etc.)</h3>
Some instruments come with multiple channels in the Mixer that can be used to change sounds midway through a score. 
For example, a staff for a stringed instrument (violin, viola, cello etc.) is allocated <em>three</em> channels: one for "arco" (or "normal"), another for "pizzicato" and another for "tremolo." A trumpet staff will have one channel for "normal" and another reserved for "mute," and so on.

The following instructions use pizzicato strings as an example, but the same principle can be applied to any other instrument staff that allows sound changes.
Select the first note of the section you want to be pizzicato;
From the main menu, choose <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>→<samp>Staff Text</samp> or use the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd>;

Type "pizz." This text is for visual reference only and does not affect playback;
Right-click on the applied staff text and select <samp>Staff Text Properties…</samp>;
In the "Change Channel" tab of the "Staff Text Properties" dialog, select one or more voices on the left;

From the dropdown menu, select <samp>pizzicato</samp>;
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2021-11/Staff_text_properties_en_0.png?itok=2WzmQIf4">

Click <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> or press <kbd><kbd></kbd></kbd> (Return) to return to the score.


Every note after the staff text you added now sounds pizzicato. 
To return to a normal strings sound later in the piece, follow the same guidelines as above except type "arco" in step 3 and select <samp>arco</samp> in step 6.

Most of the time is it far easier to just apply the corresponding text (pizz., tremolo, arco, mute, open, etc) from the Text Palette.

The Piano Roll Editor allows you edit individual notes and tweak aspects of their playback.
<h3>Opening the Piano Roll Editor</h3>
To open the Piano Roll Editor (PRE), right-click on a measure in the score and choose the Piano Roll Editor option from the context menu. 
The Piano Roll Editor will open showing the staff and measure where you clicked. 
If the Piano Roll Editor is already open, it will be updated to show the new staff and measure you clicked on.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/2018-11/PianoRoll.png?itok=E2oEzpdm">
The Piano Roll Editor is divided into several sections. 
At the very top is a row of buttons and controls that affect <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/play-mode">playback</a> and can modify notes. 
The name of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">part</a> being edited is at the top right.

The central portion contains the <strong>Note Display Area</strong> which allows you to view and edit notes. 
Each note is displayed as a block, with yellow blocks representing selected notes, and darker green blocks representing unselected notes (these colors can be changes in the Preferences). 
Given sufficient space, each block will display its pitch on the left and the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a> it is assigned to on the right. 

Changing the size of the note blocks is covered in the <a href="#navigation">navigation</a> section.
To the left of the Note Display Area is the <strong>Keyboard</strong>. 
By clicking on a key in the Keyboard, you can hear a sample of that note playing. 

As you move the mouse in either the Node Display Area or the Keyboard, a key on the keyboard will light, corresponding to the pitch you are over. 
You can also hover your mouse over a particular key to get more information about that pitch. 
If you are using a Drumkit, the keys of the keyboard will show the name of the drum assigned to that particular pitch. 

For instruments that are not concert C, the keyboard will be adjusted so that the C of the keyboard matches the C of the instrument.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/2018-12/drumkit.jpg?itok=r4ipPxhZ">
Along the top of the Note Display Area is the <strong>Measure Ruler</strong> which displays the current position of the playback head, as well as the current looping range if it set.

The bottom of the editor contains the <strong>Levels Display Area</strong>. 
It is a bar graph showing extra data values assigned to each note, such as its <em>velocity</em> or <em>cutoff</em> time. 
To the left of the Levels Display Area is a dropdown menu allowing you to select the type of data you wish to see displayed or edited.

<h3>Navigation</h3>
There are several ways to move about in the Piano Roll Editor. 
First of all, you can click and drag on the scroll bars on the edges of the Note Display Area.

The mouse wheel can also be used to pan and zoom as follows:
<strong>Scroll vertically</strong>: Mouse wheel.
<strong>Scroll horizontally</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + mouse wheel.

<strong>Zoom vertically</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> + mouse wheel.
<strong>Zoom horizontally</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + mouse wheel.
To jump to a particular measure, switch back to score view and find the measure you wish to see. 

Then right-click on the measure and select Piano Roll Editor. 
The Piano Roll Editor will scroll to center on the measure you clicked.
<h3>Selecting Notes</h3>
In the Note Display Area, you can click on single notes or click and drag to select a group of notes. 
 Holding down the modifier keys will affect how your selection changes:
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>: Invert existing selection: i.e. 

notes that were previously selected are deselected, and notes which were not selected are selected. 
Useful for toggling a note between selected and not selected.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>: Add notes to selection.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>: Subtract notes from selection.
<h3>Editing Notes</h3>
<strong>To change the pitch of a selection of notes</strong>: Drag a selected note up or down to a new pitch; or press the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> arrows. 

<em>Note</em>: Dragging the note horizontally to change the start time is not supported at the moment.
<strong>To delete a selection of notes</strong>: Press the <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> key.
<strong>To move a note selection to another voice</strong>: Click the desired voice number button at the top of the editor.

<strong>To add notes</strong>:
Notes can be inserted by clicking in the Piano Note Area with the modifier keys held. 
These edit operations will use the beat or subbeat line to the left of the spot where you click as the point where a note is altered:

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>: A note of the current insert note duration will be added at the subbeat and pitch where you clicked. 
The note insert length is the same as the one you use to add notes in note entry mode in the score. 
If you wish to change the duration, you will need to select this in the Score View as the Piano Roll Editor does not currently have these buttons. 

If notes already exist in this location, a chunk will be cut out of them to make room for the note you are inserting, unless they happen to have the same start time and duration of the note you're adding, in which case the new note will simply be appended to the existing chord. 
Tuplets are currently not supported, and so will be ignored.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-12/durationButtons.jpg?itok=SzUpozpo">
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>: Looks for a chord that already spans this subbeat line. 

 If it finds one, appends a new pitch to the existing chord. 
Otherwise, this is a rest and the rest will be replaced with a note of equal start time and duration to the existing rest.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>: Looks for a chord or rest that spans this subbeat. 

This chord will be cut in two at this subbeat line. 
Tuplets are currently not supported, and so will be ignored.
<strong>To edit note event data</strong>:

Note event data can be changed in the Levels Display Area. 
To edit event data such as velocity or cutoff time, first select the notes you wish to edit in the note area. 
Then click in the Levels Display Area on the corresponding bar; the value of the level will changed to correspond to the point where you clicked. 

You can also click and drag in this area to change the levels of several notes with a single gesture. 
If you want the levels to all be set to the same value, hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> while dragging. 
Only selected notes will have their value changed - this is to prevent you from accidentally changing the values of other notes.

The Levels area can display the same data in multiple ways. 
For example, velocity data can be displayed both as absolute (i.e., relative to the output midi volume) and relative (i.e., as an offset to the dynamics value). 
 You can switch between these display modes as you see fit.

</dl>
<h4>Second Row</h4>
<dl>

<dt><strong>Cursor</strong></dt>
<dd>Provides feedback on the current measure and pitch of the position of the mouse within the Note Display Area.</dd>
<dt><strong>Subdiv</strong></dt>

<dd>
Subdivides the beat by adding extra divisions to the Note Display Area. 
The value indicated the number of time the beat will be subdivided. 

So for 4/4 time, a division of 2 will draw grid lines at every eighth note; a division of 3 at every sixteenth note, and so on. 
Setting the subdivision is necessary for some editing operations if you wish to place notes off the beat.
For larger numbers of subdivisions, you may need to be zoomed in to see the extra grid lines since grid lines are not drawn below a certain density. 

Combines with the tuplet control which also affects grid line placement.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Tuplet</strong></dt>

<dd>
Adds additional grid lines, subdividing the beat to show the rhythmic placement of tuplets. 
For example, setting tuplets to 3 will show the beat subdivided into three parts. 

Combines with the subdiv control to show subdivisions of the tuplet. 
For example, setting tuplets to 3 and subdiv to 2 will draw grid lines showing the tuplet beats subdivided into two parts - i.e., the beat will be subdivided into 6.
Selecting a tuplet mode other than 1 will disable some of the note insertion tools for the Piano Roll Editor. 

For larger numbers of subdivisions, you may need to be zoomed in to see the extra grid lines since grid lines are not drawn below a certain density.

</dd>

<dt><strong>Stripe pattern</strong></dt>
<dd>Changes the pattern of stripes shown behind the notes in the Note Display Area. 
By default the pitches of C major are  highlighted, but you can change this to highlight the pitches of a different key, or even scales such as the diminished or whole tone.</dd>

<dt><strong>Velocity</strong></dt>
<dd>
Shows the velocity of the currently selected note (only one note may be selected). 

Indicates the loudness of the note. 
This can be expressed as 'Offset' or 'User':
Offset: Value is treated as a multiplier for the velocity already set by the dynamics.

User: This is the raw value being sent to MIDI and overrides the dynamics value. 
 Values are between 0 and 127, where 64 is "middle, neither loud nor soft".
When you switch from User to Offset or vice versa, the value will be recalculated to best match the value in the other system. 

This way you could, for example, switch to User mode to set the value as you would like it to sound in MIDI output and then switch to Offset so that this value respects the dynamic marking instead of overriding it. 
At the moment you switch back, the offset value will be recalculated to match the User value in loudness but will no longer act as an override so you may later change the dynamic.
</dd>

<dt><strong>Pitch</strong></dt>
<dd>Shows the pitch and octave of the selected note in text format (i.e. 
f#4).


The pitch will change if the note is dragged Up or down to a new pitch. 
 Currently cannot be edited.</dd>
<dt><strong>OnTime</strong></dt>

<dd>Shifts the start of the note in time, which can be used to modify the playing style. 
Negative values will make the note sound earlier, positive will make it sound later. 
The duration of the note corresponds to a value of 1000 (e.g. 

setting the value to 250 will make the note sound 1/4 of its duration later).</dd>
<dt><strong>Length</strong></dt>
<dd>Set the time that the note is sounding, which may be used to modify the degree of "legato". 

Lower values will make the note sound more staccato, higher values will make it sound more legato. 
The duration of the note corresponds to a length of 1000, but the value can be set higher. 
950 is usually considered "non-legato".</dd>

</dl>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
Some keys are hooked up to perform special actions:

<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>: Move selected notes up one semitone
<kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>: Move selected notes down one semitone

<h2><br><span class="orange">SoundFonts and SFZ files</span></h2>
Audio playback is provided by MuseScore's onboard <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer">synthesizer</a>, which houses a large selection of <strong>virtual</strong> (or <strong>software</strong>) <strong>instruments</strong>—including percussion and sound effects.
MuseScore supports virtual instruments in two formats:

<a href="#soundfonts">SoundFont</a> (.sf2/.sf3): A single file containing one or more virtual instruments.
<a href="#sfz">SFZ</a> (.sfz): A set of audio and definition files containing one or more virtual instruments.
<h3>SoundFonts</h3>
MuseScore comes with its own GM (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI">General MIDI</a>) SoundFont, <strong>MuseScore_General.sf3</strong>, containing over 128 instruments, sound effects and various drum/percussion kits.
GM (General MIDI) is a universal format, so once your score is set up for correct playback using MuseScore's native Soundfont, you should be able to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#export">export</a> it in a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats">format</a> of your choice and have it play back on any other user's computer.
Many different Soundfonts are available on the Internet: some free, some commercial. 

For a list of free soundfonts, see <a href="#list">below</a>.
<h4>Install a SoundFont</h4>
After finding and decompressing a SoundFont (see →<a href="#list">below</a>), double-click to open it. 

In most cases, the SoundFont file type will already be associated with MuseScore, and MuseScore will start and a dialog will appear asking if you want to install the SoundFont. 
Occasionally an application other than MuseScore will be associated with the SoundFont file type; if this is the case, you will need to right-click or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click on the file, so as to display a menu from which you can choose to open the file in MuseScore. 
In either case, when the dialog appears asking if you want to install the SoundFont, click "Yes" to place a copy of the SoundFont file in MuseScore's SoundFonts directory. 

This directory can be viewed or changed in MuseScore's Preferences, but the default location is:
Windows: <code>%HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Soundfonts</code>
macOS and Linux: <code>~/Documents/MuseScore3/Soundfonts</code>

In contrast to user-added SoundFonts, the initial default SoundFont installed with MuseScore is located in a system directory, meant only for that purpose, which should <em>not</em> be modified. 
This directory and its default SoundFont file is:
Windows x86 (32-bit) / MuseScore x86: <code>%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3</code>

Windows x64 (64-bit) / MuseScore x86: <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3</code>
Windows x64 (64-bit) / MuseScore x86_64: <code>%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3</code>

<h4>Uninstall</h4>
To uninstall a SoundFont, simply open the folder where its file is installed and delete it.

<h3>SFZ</h3>
An SFZ is a collection of files and directories, an SFZ file and a bunch of actual sound files in WAV or FLAC format, with the SFZ file being a text file that basically describes what sound file is located where and to be used for what instrument and pitch range.
<h4>Install an SFZ</h4>
After downloading an SFZ (see →<a href="#list">below</a>), you need to manually extract all the files that belong to the SFZ (the SFZ file(s) and all the sub-directories and other files) into the directory listed <a href="#install">above</a>. 
Leave the sub-directories and their contents as they are. 
 Note, however, that on occasion, an SFZ file in its folder may seek the actual WAV sound files inside the SFZ sub-directory itself, usually in a folder labeled "Libs". 

 If the SFZ zip file you download has a Libs folder in it, move it into the main SFZ sub-directory.
<h4>Uninstall</h4>
To uninstall an SFZ, simply open the folder where its files are installed (see <a href="#install">above</a>) and delete them all.

<h3>Synthesizer</h3>
Once a SoundFont has been <a href="#install">installed</a> on your system, it also needs to be loaded into the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer">Synthesizer</a>. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer#load-soundfont">To load a soundfont</a>.

<h3>Mixer</h3>
The Mixer allows you to easily change the sounds for each staff (even while the score is playing). 
For further details, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a>.

<h3>List of downloadable soundfonts</h3>

<h4>Unzipping downloaded soundfonts</h4>
Since soundfonts are large, they are often zipped (compressed) into a variety of formats, including .zip, .sfArk, and .tar.gz. 
You need to unzip (decompress) these files before they can be used.

ZIP is standard compression format supported by most operating systems.
sfArk is a compression format designed especially for compressing SoundFont files. 
To decompress it, use <a href="https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/en">Polyphone</a> (cross-platform software); or this online service: <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/sfark-to-sf2">https://cloudconvert.com/sfark-to-sf2</a>

.tar.gz is a popular compression format for Linux. 
Windows users can use <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7-Zip</a>; Mac users can use <a href="http://unarchiver.c3.cx/unarchiver">The Unarchiver</a>, or macOS' built-in Archive Utility. 
Note that if using 7-Zip, you will need to apply decompression twice—once for GZip and once for TAR.

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
If the toolbar play panel is greyed out, or not visible, follow the instructions below to get your sound working again:
Right-click on the menu bar and make sure there is a check mark next to the <samp>Playback Controls</samp> menu item. 

If this step does not solve your problem, go to Step 2.
If the play panel disappears after changing the SoundFont, go to <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Preferences...</samp> → <samp>I/O</samp> tab and click OK without making any changes. 
After restarting MuseScore, the play panel should reappear.

If you are setting up a SoundFont for the first time, please use one of the recommended SoundFonts listed above.
If playback stutters, then your computer may not be able to handle the SoundFont being used. 
The following advice may help:

Reduce the amount of RAM (memory) used by MuseScore by using a smaller SoundFont. 
See the <a href="#list">list</a> above for suggestions.
Increase the amount of RAM available for MuseScore by quitting all applications except MuseScore. 

If you still have problems and a large SoundFont is important to you, consider more RAM for your computer.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Swing</span></h2>

MuseScore's <strong>swing</strong> feature allows you to change the playback of your score from a straight to a swing rhythm. 
Swing can be applied globally or only to a section of the score, and is fully variable.
<h3>Apply swing to a score section</h3>
To apply swing to <em>all</em> staves in a system:
Click on the note where you want swing to start;
Click <strong>Swing</strong> in the Text palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4);


This inserts a System Text object which affects all staves in the system with a default swing percentage of 60%.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the Swing text as required;
If you need to vary swing from the default setting, right-click the Swing text and select <samp>System text properties...</samp> Click on the "Swing Settings" tab and adjust note duration and "Swing ratio" as required.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-01/Swing_Settings_EN.png?itok=tMfuJhcu">


To apply swing only to <em>specific</em> staves in a system:

Click on the note where you want swing to start;
Add <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">Staff text</a>;
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the appearance of the text as required;

Right-click on the text, select <samp>Staff Text Properties...</samp>, and click on the "Swing settings" tab. 
Modify as required;
Repeat steps 1–4 for other staves if needed.


Swing text can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-basics#text-formatting">formatted</a> just like any other text object.
<h4>Triplet in tempo marking</h4>
Often this notation is used to indicate swing:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/swing_markings.png?itok=6PEKrC09, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-06/swing_markings.png?itok=z5GxnIKs 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_1480/public/2019-06/swing_markings.png?itok=QBtwVbFn">
MuseScore does not have a way to include a triplet in text as a tempo marking, but there is an easy workaround:

Add Swing text as described <a href="#setup">above</a> and make it invisible (shortcut <kbd><kbd>V</kbd></kbd>, or untick "Visible" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>);
Add an appropriate <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/images">Image</a> of the required tempo marking to the score. 
These can be downloaded from the bottom of the "How To" page: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/266325">How to create a visual swing marking</a>.

Resize and reposition the image as required.
<h3>Return to straight rhythm</h3>
If you want playback to return to straight time after a swing section, use one of the following options:

<strong>From version 3.4</strong>:
Add <strong>Straight</strong> text from the "More" field of the Workspace's text palette to the first note or rest of the "straight" section (see <a href="#setup">above</a>).
<strong>Prior to version 3.4</strong>:

Add <strong>Swing</strong> text to the first note or rest of the "straight" section  (see <a href="#setup">above</a>).
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the text to indicate a return to straight time: e.g. 
"Straight."

Right-click on the text and select <samp>System Text Properties…</samp>. 
Click on the "Swing Settings" tab and set "Swing to "Off."
<h3>Apply swing globally</h3>
If you wish to apply swing to the whole score, you can do so from the menu:
Select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> → <samp>Score</samp>.
In the "Swing Settings" section, set the desired note value and "swing ratio."

<h2><br><span class="orange">Synthesizer</span></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
To display the <strong>Synthesizer</strong>: from the menu, select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Synthesizer</samp>.

The Synthesizer controls MuseScore's sound output and allows you to:
Load and organize different sound sample libraries to play back the music.
Apply <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer#effects"> effects</a> such as reverb and compression.

Adjust overall  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer#tuning">tuning</a>.
Alter the output volume.
Select Midi Continuous Controllers to use with Single Note Dynamics (versions 3.1 and above).

The Synthesizer window is divided into the following sections/tabs:
<strong>Fluid</strong>: A software synthesizer that plays SF2/SF3 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files">SoundFont</a> sample libraries.
<strong>Zerberus</strong>: A software synthesizer that plays SFZ format sample libraries.

<strong>Master Effects</strong>: Used to apply <a href="#effects">multi-effects</a> to the score.
<strong>Tuning</strong>: Used to adjust overall playback <a href="#tuning">tuning</a>.
<strong>Dynamics</strong> (versions 3.1 and above): Used to configure Single Note Dynamics Midi controllers.

<h3>Save/Load Synthesizer settings</h3>
The buttons at the bottom of the Synthesizer window have the following functions:
<table>

<thead><tr>
<th>Button</th>
<th>Function</th>

</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td><kbd><samp class="button">Set as Default</samp></kbd></td>
<td>Saves <em>all</em> current synthesizer settings as the <em>default</em> settings. 
These are automatically applied to the Synthesizer when you open MuseScore.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><kbd><samp class="button">Load Default</samp></kbd></td>

<td>Loads the last saved <em>default</em> settings to the Synthesizer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td><kbd><samp class="button">Save to Score</samp></kbd></td>
<td>Saves <em>all</em> current synthesizer settings to the <em>current</em> score only.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><kbd><samp class="button">Load from Score</samp></kbd></td>
<td>Loads the settings from the <em>current</em> score to the synthesizer.</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<strong>Notes</strong>: (1)  "Synthesizer settings" include the order of SoundFonts and SFZ files, effects set-up, master tuning and volume. 
(2) Only one set of Synthesizer settings can be in effect at a time—i.e. 
if multiple scores are open at once, it is not possible to make changes to the Synthesizer in one score and leave other scores' settings untouched. 

(3) Changes to synthesizer settings will not be heard in exported <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#audio">audio files</a> unless saved to the score first (see table, above). 
See also <a href="#tuning">Tuning</a> (below).
<h3>Fluid</h3>
Click on the <strong>Fluid</strong> tab to access the control panel for SF2/SF3 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#soundfonts">SoundFont</a> sample libraries. 
By default, the SoundFont <code>MuseScore_General.sf3</code> should already be loaded.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/Synthesizer_Fluid_3.3.3_EN.png?itok=Zi3cjZ-i, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-01/Synthesizer_Fluid_3.3.3_EN.png?itok=116jI379 2x">


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/2020-01/Synthesizer_Fluid_3.3.3_EN.png?itok=H9BnEUn5">
You can load, rearrange and delete soundfonts as required. 
Playback can be shared between any combination of different soundfonts (and/or SFZ files). 
The order of soundfonts in <strong>Fluid</strong> is reflected in the <em>default</em> order of instruments in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">mixer</a>.

<h4>To load a soundfont</h4>
Click on the <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd> button
Click on a soundfont in the list.


To be able to load the soundfont, it first needs to be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#install">installed</a> in your <strong>Soundfonts folder</strong>. 
This will ensure that it appears in the list in step 2 (above).

<h4>To reorder the soundfonts</h4>
Click on a soundfont
Use the up/down arrows (on the right-hand side) to adjust the order.

Repeat with other soundfonts in the list if required.
Or use the double up arrow (on the top right-hand side) to move any SoundFont to the top of the list.


The order of virtual instrument sets in the Synthesizer is reflected in the order of instruments listed in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a>. 
So, if playback of a score depends on a mix of instrument sets, it is advisable to save the Synthesizer configuration to the score in question by pressing the <kbd><samp class="button">Save to Score</samp></kbd> button. 
When you next wish to play back the score, press the <kbd><samp class="button">Load from Score</samp></kbd> to load the same configuration. 

However, remember this only sets the <em>order</em> of instruments—not the instruments themselves, which should be in place on your computer.
<h4>To remove a soundfont</h4>
Click on the name of the soundfont

Click on the <kbd><samp class="button">Delete</samp></kbd> button.

This removes the soundfont from the synthesizer but does not <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#uninstall">uninstall</a> it from the Soundfonts folder: it will still be available if you wish to reload it later.

<h3>Zerberus</h3>
Click on the <strong>Zerberus</strong> tab to access the control panel for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#sfz">SFZ</a> sound sample libraries. 
You can <a href="#load-soundfont">add</a>, <a href="#remove-soundfont">delete</a> or <a href="#reorder-soundfonts">reorder</a> files in a similar way to the <a href="#fluid">Fluid</a> tab. 

Note that, as with Fluid, the SFZ files must first be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#install">installed</a> in your <strong>soundfonts</strong> folder before they can be loaded into the synthesizer.
<h3>Volume</h3>
The slider on the right of the Synthesizer controls the playback volume: any changes made here last only to the end of the session, unless saved to the score or set as the new default.

<h3>Effects</h3>
The <strong>Master Effects</strong> tab of the Synthesizer allows you to add <a href="#zita1">reverb</a> and <a href="#sc4">compression</a> to your score.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/MasterEffects-Zita1-SC4_en.png?itok=eGsn7CXK, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-06/MasterEffects-Zita1-SC4_en.png?itok=BhJepK6d 2x">

<em>Master Effects with Zita1 Reverb and SC4 Compressor.</em>
To turn an effect on or off:
Select an option from the drop-down list next to <strong>Effect A</strong> or <strong>Effect B</strong> (the effects are applied in series, A → B).

To store and load effects configurations, use the buttons at the bottom of the Synthesizer window. 
See <a href="#synth-settings">Synthesizer settings</a> (above) for details.
<h4>Zita 1 reverb</h4>
The <strong>Zita 1</strong> stereo reverb module allows you to simulate the ambience of anything from a small room to a large hall. 
The pre-delay, reverb time and tone of the reverb can be finely tuned using the controls provided:
<strong>Delay</strong>: Set a pre-delay for the reverb from 20-100 ms.

<strong>Low RT60</strong> (Low frequency reverb time): Use the grey control to adjust the center frequency (50–1000 Hz) of the low frequency band which you want to affect: the green control adjusts the reverb time (1–8 secs) of this frequency band.
<strong>Mid RT60</strong> (Mid-range reverb time): Adjust the reverb time (1–8 secs) of the mid-range frequency band.
<strong>HF Damping</strong>: Adjusts the high frequency component of the reverb. 

Increasing this value increases the frequency of the cut-off point and makes the reverb appear brighter and longer.
<strong>EQ1</strong>: Allows you to cut or boost (-15 to +15) a frequency band (center = 40 Hz - 2 KHz) in the <em>lower</em> part of the spectrum.
<strong>EQ2</strong>: Allows you to cut or boost (-15 to +15) a frequency band (center = 160 Hz - 10 KHz) in the <em>higher</em> part of the spectrum.

<strong>Output</strong>: Controls the amount of effect applied. 
"Dry" is no effect. 
"Wet" indicates 100% reverb. 

"Mix" is a 50/50 balance of wet/dry signal.
<strong>Note</strong>: EQ1 and EQ2 affect the tone of the reverb only, <em>not</em> the dry (unprocessed) signal.
To quickly set up an effects patch, set "Output" to "Mix" and adjust the "Mid RT60" control to the desired reverb time. 

Then fine tune the effect as explained above.
<h4>SC4 compressor</h4>
The <strong>SC4</strong> stereo compressor gives you fine control over the playback's dynamic range, reducing the volume variation between loud and soft sounds. 

It offers the following controls:
<strong>RMS</strong>: Adjusts the balance between RMS (0) and Peak (1) compression. 
In the former, the compressor responds to averaged-out levels in the signal; in Peak mode, the compressor responds to peak levels.

<strong>Attack</strong>: (1.5–400 ms) The length of time it takes for compression to engage fully after the signal exceeds the threshold level.
<strong>Release</strong>: (2–800 ms) The time it takes for compression to return to zero after the signal falls below the threshold level.
<strong>Threshold</strong>: (in dB) The signal level  above which compression starts to take effect. 

Lowering the threshold increases the amount of signal that is compressed.
<strong>Ratio</strong>: The amount of compression applied to the signal above the threshold. 
The higher the ratio, the greater the compression. 

Varies between 1:1 and 20:1.
<strong>Knee</strong>: Allows you to select a range between "soft knee" and "hard knee". 
The softer the knee, the more gradual the transition between uncompressed and compressed signal.

<strong>Gain</strong>: Compression tends to lower the volume, so use this control to boost the signal as required.
To quickly set-up, try setting RMS = 1, Threshold = -20 db, Ratio = 6. 
Increase Gain to restore the lost volume. 

Then fine-tune as explained above.
<h3>Tuning</h3>
The <strong>Tuning</strong> tab is where you can adjust the program's <strong>master tuning</strong>. 

For Concert Pitch instruments, A4 = 440 Hz by default.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Tempo</span></h2>
<strong>Tempo markings</strong> can be found in the Tempo <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> of the Basic and Advanced  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>. 
They are supplied as metronome marks, but can be subsequently edited to display any tempo or expression you want. 

Playback tempo can be varied throughout the score by using multiple tempo markings, visible or invisible.
<h3>Add a tempo marking</h3>
Use any of the following methods:

Select a note or rest and press the <strong>keyboard shortcut</strong> <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd>.
Select a note or rest, and from the <strong>menu bar</strong> choose <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text...</samp>→<samp>Tempo Marking</samp>.
Select a note or rest and click an appropriate metronome mark in the <strong>Tempo</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (double-click in versions prior to 3.4);

Drag-and-drop a metronome mark from the <strong>Tempo</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> directly onto a note or rest.
<strong>Note</strong>: If a tempo marking is applied from the menu or using a keyboard shortcut, the beat note automatically follows the time signature. 
The advantage of applying from a palette is that <em>you</em> can choose which beat note to use.

<h3>Edit tempo</h3>
To change the tempo of an existing metronome mark in the score:
Go into <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing#text-edit-mode">Edit mode</a> on the tempo mark in question;

Edit the metronome number and/or the beat note as required;
Exit Edit mode.
You can also override the tempo of an existing metronome mark from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>:

Select the tempo mark;
Untick "Follow text" in the <strong>Tempo text</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>;

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/inspector_tempo_text.PNG?itok=Q9FQOeeA">


Set the desired playback tempo in the "Tempo" field underneath.
<strong>Note</strong>: Playback may be faster or slower if the tempo setting in the <a href="#play-panel">play panel</a> is at a percentage other than 100%.
<h3>Edit tempo text</h3>
Tempo marks can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> and formatted just like any other <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> object. 
To set text properties or text style, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">Text styles and properties</a>.
The tempo indicated by a metronome mark usually persists even if overwritten by an expression—such as Andante, Moderato etc. 

You can also <em>add</em> further text to a plain metronome mark. 
e.g.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/met_mark_5.jpg?itok=OJpHr6Ur">


<h3>Overriding the tempo marking</h3>
You can temporarily override the indicated <a href="#tempo-marking">tempo</a>, and play the score back at any tempo you like using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/play-mode#play-panel">play panel</a>:
Display the play panel: <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Play Panel</samp> or <kbd><kbd>F11</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd></kbd>):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/play_panel_v3_en.png?itok=pxhLwrSj">
Move the tempo slider up or down as required. 
The tempo is shown both as an absolute value and as a percentage of the currently indicated tempo mark. 
Double-click the tempo slider to reset it.

<em>Note:</em> BPM is always measured and displayed in quarter note beats per minute, regardless of the (denominator of the) time signature in effect.
<h3>Ritardando and accelerando playback</h3>
You can simulate <strong>ritardando</strong> ("<em>rit.</em>") and <strong>accelerando</strong> ("<em>accel.</em>") playback by adding hidden tempo markings to the score. 

The printed indication to the musician should be added as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">staff/system text</a> in addition.
In the example illustrated below, the tempo was originally 110 BPM (beats per minute). 
At the ritardando, the tempo decreases by 10 BPM on the first note of each measure. 

Each tempo change is made invisible by unchecking the <strong>Visible</strong> checkbox in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, so that only the ritardando shows on the printed score:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/ritardando_0.png?itok=GH7CUzdd">

A <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins">plugin</a> has been developed to automate this process: <em><a href="https://musescore.org/project/tempochanges">TempoChanges</a></em>

<h3>Fermatas</h3>
Fermatas, available in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/articulations-and-ornaments">Articulations and Ornaments</a> palette, have a <strong>Time stretch</strong> property that can be set via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
By default, this property is set to 1.00. 

To have MuseScore play back a fermata for twice its normal duration, click on the fermata and set "Time stretch" to 2.00. 
This of course does not work for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/articulations-and-ornaments#barline">fermatas applied to barlines</a>, as barlines don't have a duration to stretch.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Dynamics</span></h2>
<strong>Dynamics</strong> are symbols indicating the relative loudness of a note or phrase of music. 
They can be found in the Dynamics <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in either the Basic or Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#workspaces">workspace</a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Dynamics.png?itok=ODZ-ejaE">

Additional dynamics are available in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/master-palette">Master Palette</a> (<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>Note</strong>:  if you wish to adjust the <em>overall</em> playback volume of the score, use the volume slider in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/play-mode#play-panel">Play Panel</a>, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer">Synthesizer</a>.

<h3>Add a dynamic</h3>
<strong>To apply a dynamic to the score</strong>, use one of the following methods:
Select a note and click a dynamic symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag a dynamic symbol from a palette onto a note.
<strong>To create a crescendo or decrescendo</strong>, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/hairpins">Hairpin</a>.
<h3>Adjust properties</h3>
The default dynamic of the score is <strong><em>mf</em></strong> (mezzoforte)—set at MIDI velocity 80 (out of 127). 
Depending on the dynamic governing a particular section of the score, velocity (and the resulting loudness) may be less than or greater than this.
<h4>To edit the velocity of a dynamic</h4>
Select the dynamic and, in the <strong>Dynamic</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> edit the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#velocity">Velocity</a> value—higher for louder, lower for softer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-09/Velocity_speed.png?itok=4CjhZ19u">
<h4>To adjust the range</h4>
<em>Note</em>: Range = the staves in the system affected by the dynamic.

Select the dynamic, and in the <strong>Dynamic</strong> section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>, choose an option from "Dynamic range". 
The default is "Part," which means that all staves for a particular instrument will be affected. 
"Staff" limits the effect to the staff attached to the dynamic. 

"System" means that all staves in the system will be affected by the dynamic.
<h4>To change the placement (above or below stave)</h4>
For a single dynamic mark: select the dynamic, and type <kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> to flip the placement or use the Inspector, see below.

For all dynamic marks on a stave:
Right-click on one dynamic, then choose <em>Select &gt; All Similar Elements on Same Stave</em>
In the <strong>Dynamic</strong> section of the <strong>Inspector</strong> choose the required option <em>Above</em> or <em>Below</em> from "Placement"

For all dynamic marks in the score:

See above, then use the "Set as Style" button of Inspector
<h3>Customize a dynamic</h3>
Dynamics can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> just like any other text object. 
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing#special-character-shortcuts">Special character shortcuts</a> can be used to add the following symbols:
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Piano <em>p</em></strong>.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Forte <em>f</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Mezzo <em>m</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Rinforzando <em>r</em></strong>.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></kbd>: <strong>Sforzando <em>s</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Niente <em>n</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Z <em>z</em></strong>.

You can also edit the velocity and range etc. 
(see <a href="#adjust-properties">above</a>). 
If desired, you can save the result for future use in a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">custom palette</a>.

<h3>Single Note Dynamics (SND)</h3>
As of version 3.1, MuseScore supports <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#single-note-dynamic">single note dynamics</a>. 
In addition to <a href="#edit-velocity">editing the velocity</a>, you can also edit the velocity change in the inspector. 

Entering a number into this field will change the velocity of the note by approximately that amount after the initial velocity is played. 
A negative number can be used to lower the volume after the initial note and a positive number will make the note play louder after the initial volume. 
See links (below) for further details.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Capo playback</span></h2>
MuseScore allows you to transpose the playback of a staff, without affecting the music notation. 
This simulates the effect of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capo">capo</a> (Wikipedia) on the instrument.

<h3>Add capo to a single staff</h3>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-basics">Add</a> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">staff text</a> to the note/rest from which you want capo playback to start;
Click on "Properties" in the "Staff Text" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, or right-click on the staff text and  select <samp>Staff Text Properties...</samp>; then click on the <strong>Capo Settings</strong> tab;

Check the "Capo Settings" checkbox, and set <strong>Capo fret</strong> to the fret number you wish to apply the capo at (each fret increases the pitch by a semitone);
Click <kbd><samp class="button">Ok</samp></kbd> to apply your changes;
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the wording of the text as desired.


<h3>Add capo to linked staff/tablature</h3>
Same method as above, but in step 1, add the staff text to the music staff only.

<h3>Add capo to unlinked staff/tablature</h3>
Same method as above, but apply the staff text to both staff and tablature.
<strong>Note</strong>: Capo playback will apply from the note that the staff text is attached to, until either the next staff text with "Capo Settings" enabled, or until the end of the score.

<h3>Remove capo</h3>
To remove capo playback from a staff, returning the instrument to its normal tuning:
Add staff text with a "Capo fret" setting of "No capo".

<h2><br><span class="orange">Playback: Chord symbols / Nashville numbers</span></h2>
As of MuseScore version 3.5, both <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols">chord symbols</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols#nns">Nashville numbers</a> (but not <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols#rna">Roman numerals</a>) automatically sound when you play back the score.


As of MuseScore 3.5.1 this only happens with scores initially created with MuseScore 3.5 or later, for older scores you'd need to enable it, using the methods described <a href="#playback-off">below</a>.
<h3>Turn playback on/off</h3>
<em>Note</em>: Settings made below also affect <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#audio">Audio</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#midi">MIDI</a> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#export">export</a>.

<h4>For all scores (as of version 3.5.1)</h4>
To enable or disable chord symbol playback for <em>all</em> scores:
Select <samp>Edit</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>)→<samp>Preferences…</samp>→<samp>Advanced</samp>); then the following options, as required:

<strong>To disable/enable playback of pre-version 3.5 scores</strong>: Check/Uncheck <code>score/harmony/play/disableCompatibility</code> (default is checked—no playback)
<strong>To disable/enable playback of version 3.5 or later scores</strong>: Check/Uncheck<code>score/harmony/play/disableNew</code>  (default is unchecked, playback)
<h4>For the current score</h4>
<h5>As of version 3.5.1</h5>
<em>To turn playback of ALL chord symbols on/off</em>:
Tick/Untick <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp>Chord Symbols</samp>→<kbd><samp class="button">Play</samp></kbd>.

<h5>As of version 3.5</h5>
<em>To turn playback of ALL chord symbols on/off</em>:
Select a chord symbol or Nashville number

In the "Chord Symbol" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> check/uncheck the "Play" box.
Click on the associated "Set as style" button (to the right of that box, you may need to scroll a bit)


Alternatively, you can mute the playback track(s) in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">mixer</a>—see <a href="#change-volume">below</a>. 
This might be necessary, for example, when you have chord symbols on more than one staff and want to have playback for only one of them. 
Score <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">parts</a> need to be adjusted separately.

<em>To turn playback of a SELECTION of chord symbols on/off</em>:
Select a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">range</a> of symbols.
Right-click a chord symbol or Nashville number.

Click on <samp>Select</samp>→<samp>Select all similar elements in selected range</samp>, <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd>.
In the "Chord Symbol" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> check/uncheck the "Play" box.
or

Click on first chord symbol or Nashville number in that range.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+click</kbd> on last chord symbol or Nashville number in that range.
In the "Chord Symbol" section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> check/uncheck the "Play" box.

<strong>Note</strong>: This does not affect the parts which need to be adjusted seperately.
<h3>Change playback sound</h3>
The default sound for chord symbols is "Grand Piano". 

As of version 3.5.1, scores created from Guitar solo <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#choose-template">templates</a>, use "Nylon String Guitar" instead.
To change the chord symbol playback sound:
Open the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a> (shortcut: <kbd><kbd>F10</kbd></kbd>, Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd></kbd>)

In the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer#track-area">Track area</a> locate the <strong>track</strong> for the part in question.
Click on the "Show channels" arrow to display all the <em>child tracks</em> for that part.
Click on the track whose name contains the words "harmony" or "Chord syms." (may be truncated, should be the rightmost).

Select a new "Sound" in the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer#patch">Sound</a> drop-down list.
This setting is shared between score and parts.
<h3>Change playback volume / Mute track</h3>
Open the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a> (shortcut: <kbd><kbd>F10</kbd></kbd>, Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd></kbd>)
In the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer#track-area">Track area</a> locate the <strong>track</strong> for the part in question.
Click on the "Show channels" arrow to display all the <em>child tracks</em> for that part.

Click on the track whose name contains the words "Chord syms." (may be truncated, should be the rightmost).
Adjust the volume slider; or press the "M" button to mute the track.
You'd need to do this for the score and/or the parts, separately.

<h3>Turn symbol sound on/off when editing</h3>
To turn the sound of the symbols on/off when editing:
From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>)→<samp>Preferences…</samp>→<samp>Note input</samp>.

Check/Uncheck the "Play chord symbol when editing" option.

<h3>Interpretation and voicing of chord symbols</h3>
If desired, you can adjust the playback properties of selected chord symbols as follows:
Select one or more chord symbols.
In the Inspector make changes as follows:

<strong>Interpretation</strong>. 
The options are:
<em>Literal</em>;

<em>Jazz</em>. 
This adds color tones (e.g. 
the major 9th) but <em>may</em> also omit certain notes—this depends on both the chord itself and the context (the next chord in particular).

<strong>Voicing</strong>. 
Options are:
<em>Auto</em>

<em>Root only</em> = Just the bass note;
<em>Close</em> = arranges the notes within the span of an octave;
<em>Drop 2</em> =  lowers the second highest note of the chord by one octave;

<em>Six Note</em>;
<em>Four Note</em> = 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th intervals;
<em>Three Note</em>.
<strong>Note</strong>: All voicings include a bass note, 2 octaves below the root note of the chord.

<strong>Duration</strong>: Options are
<em>Until next chord symbol</em>
<em>Until measure end</em>

<em>Chord/rest duration</em>.

The following shows how the Interpretation and Voicing options affect the playback of a C major seventh symbol (Cmaj7 or CM7).

<strong>Note</strong>: The "Close" and "Auto" Voicing options are the same for this particular chord, but this isn't necessarily the case for every chord. 
 So if you specifically want "Close", it is best to make the option explicit.

<h3>Add text</h3>
To add a text-based element to the score, use one of the following general methods:
<strong>Keyboard shortcut</strong>: For example, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd>to enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">Staff text </a>, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd></kbd> to enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lyrics">Lyrics</a>, and so on.

<strong>Menu command</strong>: <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp> allows you to choose from a range of text-based elements.
<strong>Workspace</strong>: Select a note and click an icon in one of the palettes (double-click in versions prior to 3.4); or, alternatively, drag a symbol from a palette onto the staff. 
E.g. 

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/swing">Swing text</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/tempo">Tempo text</a> etc.
<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) The exact method depends on the type of text you are adding (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">Text</a>). 
(2) For general-purpose <strong>text boxes</strong> attached to staves, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">Staff and system text</a>.

<h3>Text formatting</h3>
When a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties#text-objects">text object</a> is created in MuseScore, it assumes the corresponding <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties#text-styles">Text Style</a>: all <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#staff-text">staff text</a>, for example, has a unique Text Style, as have tempo markings, dynamics, chord symbols etc. 
Each Text Style consists of a number of text properties (font-face, font-size, font-style etc.), which can be viewed, mainly, in the <strong>Text Styles</strong> dialog (<samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties#text-styles">Text Styles</a></samp>).

A newly-created <strong>text object</strong> starts off with identical text properties to the Text Style. 
These can be viewed in the Inspector:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/inspector_text_0.png?itok=fKCoyQyZ">


However, these text properties are <em>not</em> limited to those of the default Text Style: if need be, you can edit them in the Inspector <em>independently</em> of Text Style.
Finally, if you want to apply formatting to specific characters in a text object (font-face, font-size, Bold, Italic, Underline, superscript, subscript), you can do so in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">text edit mode</a>.
<h3>Adjust position of text objects</h3>
To position a text object, use any of the following methods:
Drag the object.
Select the object and adjust the X or Y offset values in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#categories">Inspector</a>.

Select the object and apply any of the following keyboard shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd>: Move text left 0.1 <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">staff space</a>.
<kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd>: Move text right 0.1 staff space.

<kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>: Move text up 0.1 staff space.
<kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>: Move text down 0.1 staff space.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd>): Move text left one staff space.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>): Move text right one staff space.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>): Move text up one staff space.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd></kbd>): Moves text down one staff space.

<h3>Text anchors</h3>
When you apply a text element to the score, its <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#anchor">anchor</a> position will depend on the type:
<strong>Title, Subtitle, Composer, Poet</strong>: Anchored to a frame.

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/fingering">Fingering</a>: Anchored to note heads.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lyrics">Lyrics</a>: Anchored to a time position.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols">Chord symbol</a>: Anchored to a time position.

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#staff-text">Staff text</a>: Anchored to a time position.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#system-text">System text</a>: Anchored to a time position.
Sticking: Anchored to a time position.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Text editing</span></h2>
<strong>Text edit mode</strong> allows you to add or delete text, and apply formatting (e.g. 

<strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, underline etc.) to individual characters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/textedit_2.png?itok=20KqXIsQ">
<h3>Enter/exit text edit mode</h3>
To enter <strong>Text edit mode</strong> use one of the following methods:

Double-click a text object.
Click on an already selected text object.
Right-click on a text object and select <samp>Edit element</samp>.

Click on a text object and press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>E</kbd></kbd>.
<em>Note</em>: Creating a new text object (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-basics#add-text">Text basics</a>) also puts the program into text edit mode.
You can access the various formatting functions from the <strong>Text toolbar</strong>, which appears below the document window:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/text_toolbar.PNG?itok=P3V0-p61">

To exit <strong>Text edit mode</strong> use one of the following:
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.

Click on a part of the score outside the edit window.
<h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
In <strong>Text edit mode</strong>, the following keyboard shortcuts are available:

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd></kbd>) toggles <strong>bold face</strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd></kbd>) toggles <em>italic</em>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd></kbd>) toggles underline.

<kbd><kbd>Home</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>End</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd> <kbd> <kbd>→</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd>  <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> moves cursor.
<kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Delete</kbd></kbd>) removes character to the left of the cursor.
<kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>→ Delete</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>) removes character to the right of the cursor.

<kbd><kbd></kbd></kbd> starts new line.
<kbd><kbd>F2</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd></kbd>) Inserts special characters (see below).
<h3>Symbols and special characters</h3>
You can use the <strong>Special Characters</strong> window to insert quarter notes, fractions, and many other kinds of special symbols or characters into your text. 
A few symbols can also be accessed by <a href="#special-character-shortcuts">shortcut</a> (see below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/special_characters_en.png?itok=QkspGy5L">


)" title="The Special Characters palette contains buttons for inserting symbols into the text (e.g. 
quarter note), or special characters (e.g. 
copyright symbol, )">

To open <strong>Special Characters</strong>, use any of the following methods:
Click on the 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Keyboard.png?itok=1b1GNcG3">


icon in the text toolbar (below the score window).
Press <kbd><kbd>F2</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>Note</strong>: (1) This only works in <a href="#text-edit-mode">Text edit mode</a>; (2) The Special Characters dialog should not be confused with the menu item of the same name in the macOS version of MuseScore.

The dialog is divided into 3 tabs: Common symbols, musical symbols and unicode symbols. 
The musical and unicode tabs are further subdivided into alphabetically-arranged categories.
Double-clicking an item in the Special Characters dialog immediately adds it to the text where the cursor is positioned. 

Multiple items can be applied without closing the dialog box, and the user can even continue to type normally, delete characters,  enter numerical character codes etc., with it open.
<h4>Special character shortcuts</h4>
In <strong>Text edit mode</strong> the following keyboard shortcuts can be used to access certain special characters:

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>#</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>#</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Sharp </strong>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Text styles and properties</span></h2>
<h3>Text styles</h3>
When you create a text object, it initially assumes the properties of the  <strong>Text Style</strong> applicable to its class. 

<em>Staff text</em> objects, for example, have their own style, as do <em>tempo markings</em>, <em>lyrics</em>, <em>chord symbols</em>, and so on.
To view and edit any <strong>Text Style</strong>: select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp>Text Styles</samp>. 
This gives you access to the following properties:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-08/text_style_properties_en.png?itok=Dy1OOwJg">

<strong>Name</strong>: Change the name of a user style if desired.
<strong>Font face</strong> / <strong>Font size</strong>: The name of the font (e.g. 

<em>Times New Roman</em>, <em>Arial</em> etc.) and its size in points.
<strong>Follow staff size</strong>: Whether text size changes in proportion to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#scaling">score scaling</a>.
<strong>Font style</strong>: The font style to use, e.g. 

Italic, Bold or Underline.
<strong>Align</strong>: Horizontal (left, center, right) and Vertical.
<strong>Color</strong>: Color of the text.

<strong>Offset</strong> <strong>X</strong>/<strong>Y</strong>: Horizontal and vertical offsets in sp. 
units.
<strong>Frame</strong>: Choose to have a circular or square frame around the text.

<strong>Border</strong>: Color of the frame border.
<strong>Highlight</strong>: Color of the background within the frame.
<strong>Thickness</strong>: Thickness of the line of the frame in space units.

<strong>Margin</strong>: Inner frame margin in space units.
<strong>Corner radius</strong>: For box frame, radius of rounded corner.
<strong>Notes</strong>: Opacity is set by the parameter "Alpha channel" in the "Select Color" dialog: a value between 0, transparent, and 255, opaque.

Alternatively, you can edit the properties of a <strong>Text Style</strong> by selecting an object of the desired style in the score, adjusting its properties in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, and clicking the <strong>Set as style</strong> buttons as you go. 
This will automatically update the <strong>Text Style</strong> and all relevant text objects in the score.
<h3>Text objects</h3>
If you want to format a <em>particular</em> <strong>text object</strong> in the score differently to its <a href="#text-styles">Text Style</a>, select it and adjust its text properties in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-08/inspector_text_en.png?itok=fT7x_cC1">

If you have made changes to a particular text property in the Inspector, but want to revert that property to the <strong>Text Style</strong> definition, press the "Reset to style default" button.

<h3>Save and load text styles</h3>
Text Styles (together with all other styles in a document) can be saved as a <em>style file</em> and loaded into other MuseScore files.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Staff and system text</span></h2>

<strong>Staff Text</strong> or <strong>System Text</strong> is invaluable as general purpose text. 
To apply to the score, use one of the following methods:
Select a note or rest; then for <strong>Staff text</strong>, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>T</kbd></kbd>; or for <strong>System text</strong>, press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>+<kbd><kbd>T</kbd></kbd>.

Select a note or rest; then select the desired option from <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>.
Select a note or rest, then click the desired text from a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag the desired text from a palette onto a note or rest.

This will create an empty bounding box for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">text entry</a>. 
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> or click on an empty space outside the box to exit.
Apart from their indicative use, staff and system text also have optional playback properties: see below.

<h3>Staff text</h3>
<strong>Staff Text</strong> is applied to one <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#staff">staff</a> (or Grand staff) in the score, and is indicative only for that staff; any playback effect associated with the text is limited in the same way. 
The text will appear in the corresponding instrument <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">part</a>.
If you choose to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-score">hide empty staves</a>, any staff text belonging to an empty staff will also be hidden.

<h4>Staff text properties</h4>
The regular properties of the text, such as font, size, italics etc, can be viewed and updated directly in the inspector, but staff text can also have properties related to playback.
Staff text can, for example, be used to apply indications such as <em>Solo</em> or <em>Pizzicato</em> to one staff in a score. 

Depending on what the instruction of the staff text is,  playback of that staff at the text location can sometimes be altered to match the instruction. 
The playback properties of a staff text can be accessed in two ways:
Select the staff text, and click on "Properties" in the "Staff Text" section of the Inspector.

Right-click on the text and choose "Staff Text Properties," then click on the relevant tab.
The dialog window that opens contains tabs for the following playback properties:
<dl>

<dt>Change Channel</dt>
<dd>This property can be used to change the sound of an instrument, such as switching between open and muted sound for a trumpet, or between arco and pizzicato for a violin. 
This only works for instruments which are defined to have more than one channel. 

You can check this by selecting the "Change Channel" tab and click on one of the option fields in the "Channel:" column. 
If there is only one option "normal", this instrument only has one channel. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer#mid-staff-change">Mid-staff Sound Change</a> for more info.</dd>

<dt>Swing Settings</dt>
<dd>To switch between playing with "straight" and "swing" feeling for just this staff/instrument. 
Note that you can also apply swing to all staffs in the score or to the the complete score from start to finish. 

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/swing">Swing</a> for more info.</dd>
<dt>Capo Settings</dt>
<dd>For stringed instruments you can apply a "capo", transposing the playback up by a number of frets/halftone steps. 

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/capo-playback">Capo playback</a> for more info.</dd>
<dt>MIDI Action</dt>
<dd>This tab's settings currently do nothing and can be ignored.</dd>

</dl>
When staff text is copied and pasted elsewhere in the score, or if it is added to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">custom palette</a>, the playback properties are also copied.
<h3>System text</h3>
<strong>System text</strong> is applied to one staff in the score, but is indicative for <em>every</em> staff in the system. 
Any associated playback properties are applied to the whole system. 
The text will appear in all instrument <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">parts</a>.

System text is never hidden by the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-score">hide empty staves</a> feature.
<h4>System text properties</h4>
To add or edit <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/swing">Swing</a>:

Right-click on the text and choose <strong>System Text properties</strong>, then click on the <strong>Swing Settings</strong> tab.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Chord symbols</span></h2>
<strong>Chord symbols</strong>  are an abbreviated way of representing musical chords (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_names_and_symbols_(popular_music)">Chord names and symbols</a> (Wikipedia) for further details). 

For example:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-06/chord-symbols.png?itok=rktSFd1v">
<strong>Note</strong>: To fill measures with slashes, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tools#fill-with-slashes">Fill with slashes</a> or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tools#toggle-rhythmic-slash-notation">Toggle rhythmic slash notation</a>.
As well as conventional chord symbol notation, MuseScore as of version 3.3 also supports the <a href="#nns">Nashville Number System</a> (NNS), and <a href="#rna">Roman Numeral Analysis</a> (RNA).

<h3>Enter a chord symbol</h3>
Select a start note or a slash;
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd></kbd>);

The cursor is now positioned above the staff ready for input. 
Enter the chord symbol just like normal text, as follows:
<strong>Root note</strong>: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

<strong>Sharp</strong>: <kbd><kbd>#</kbd></kbd> (hash symbol, <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd> on a UK keyboard).
<strong>Flat</strong>: <kbd><kbd>b</kbd></kbd> (small letter "b").
<strong>Double sharp</strong>: <kbd><kbd>x</kbd></kbd> (small letter "x")  or <kbd><kbd>#</kbd><kbd>#</kbd></kbd> (two hash symbols).

<strong>Double flat</strong>: <kbd><kbd>b</kbd><kbd>b</kbd></kbd> (small letter "b" twice).
<strong>Natural</strong>: <kbd><kbd>natural</kbd></kbd>. 
 <em>Note</em>: There should be no space <em>before</em> the word "natural", but any chord text following it should be separated by a space—the latter inserted using the command <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>. 

Thus, to write <strong>Bm</strong>: enter "Bnatural", then press<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>, then type "m". 
You can also use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd></kbd>. 
Note that neither of these transpose or play back (other than the root note), or export to MusicXML properly.

For other symbols, see <a href="#chord-symbol-syntax">Chord symbol syntax</a> (below).
Move the cursor forward or backwards to continue entering or editing chord symbols (see <a href="#commands">Keyboard commands</a> below);
Exit chord symbol mode by pressing <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.


When you exit a chord symbol, the characters entered will automatically assume the correct format: by default a <strong>root note</strong> typed in lower case will turn into upper case (for alternative options, see <a href="#automatic-capitalization">Automatic Capitalization</a>); a "<strong>#</strong>", "<strong>b</strong>" or "<strong>natural</strong>" will turn into a proper sharp (), flat () or natural () and so on. 
Do not try to use actual flat, sharp and natural signs, as MuseScore will not understand those properly.

<h4>Keyboard commands</h4>
The following commands are available during chord symbol entry:
<kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> move Cursor to next note, rest, or beat

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> move cursor to previous note, rest, or beat
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>) add a space to the chord name

<h4>Chord symbol syntax</h4>
MuseScore understands most of the abbreviations used in chord symbols:
<strong>Major</strong>: M, Ma, Maj, ma, maj, Δ (type <kbd><kbd>t</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd></kbd></kbd> for the triangle)
<strong>Minor</strong>:  m, mi, min, -

<strong>Diminished</strong>: dim, ° (entered with lowercase letter <kbd><kbd>o</kbd></kbd>, shows as ° if using the <a href="#appearance">Jazz style</a>, as o, the Greek omicron, otherwise)
<strong>Half-diminished</strong>:  (entered with <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd>, number zero, shows as  if using the <a href="#appearance">Jazz style</a>, as 0 (zero) otherwise). 
Alternatively, you can, of course, choose abbreviations such as mi7b5 etc.

<strong>Augmented</strong>: aug, +
The following abbreviations are also valid: <em>extensions</em> and <em>alterations</em> like b9 or #5, sus, alt, and no3; <em>inversions</em> and <em>slash chords</em>, such as C7/E; <em>commas</em>;  <em>parentheses</em>, which can enclose part, or even all, of a chord symbol.
<h4>Edit a chord symbol</h4>
An existing chord symbol can be edited in a similar way to ordinary text: See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Text editing</a>.
<h3>Transpose chord symbols</h3>
Chord symbols are automatically transposed by default if you apply the menu <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition">Transpose</a> command to the containing measures. 

If this is not required, you can untick the "Transpose chord symbols" option in the same dialog.
<h3>Chord symbol text</h3>
To adjust the appearance of <em>all</em> <strong>chord symbol</strong> text, use any of the following options:

From the main menu, choose <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style</samp> → <samp>Text Styles</samp> → <samp>Chord Symbol</samp>. 
Then edit the text properties as required.
Select a chord symbol and make changes in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, pressing the "Set as style" buttons as you go.

<h3>Chord symbol style</h3>
To access formatting options for <strong>chord symbols</strong>:
From the menu, select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-chord-symbols">Chord Symbols</a></samp>. 

Adjustable properties are listed under the following headings:
<h4>Appearance</h4>
Three options are possible: <strong>Standard</strong> and <strong>Jazz</strong> and <strong>Custom</strong>. 

 You can select between these using the radio buttons.
In the <strong>Standard</strong> style, chords are rendered simply, with the font determined by your <a href="#chord-symbol-text">chord symbol text</a> style.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-07/standard.png?itok=qgPxNJNz">


In the <strong>Jazz</strong> style, the MuseJazz font is used for a handwritten look, with distinctive superscript and other formatting characteristics. 
The Jazz style is selected by default if you use any of the Jazz templates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-07/jazz.png?itok=WLhXH2eY">


The <strong>Custom</strong> style option allows you to customize the look of chord symbols (and also ensures compatibility with older scores). 
Select a customized <strong>Chord symbols style file</strong> in the field below: this can be created by copying and modifying one of the pre-existing files in the "styles" folder. 
Documentation can be found in the same folder. 

Note, however, that this is for advanced users only, and there is no guarantee these files will be supported in the future.
<h4>Note spelling</h4>
By default, MuseScore uses letter names for chord symbols. 

 For users in regions where other note naming schemes are used, MuseScore provides the following controls:
<strong>Standard</strong>: A, B, B, C, C,...
<strong>German</strong>: A, B, H, C, C,...

<strong>Full German</strong>: A, B, H, C, Cis,...
<strong>Solfeggio</strong>: Do, Do, Re, Re,...
<strong>French</strong>: Do, Do, Ré, Ré,...

<h5>Automatic Capitalization</h5>
By default, MuseScore automatically capitalizes all note names on exit, regardless of whether you entered them in upper or lower case. 
 However, you can also choose other automatic capitalization options:

<strong>Lower case minor chords</strong>: c, cm, cm7,...
<strong>Lower case bass notes</strong>: C/e,...
<strong>All caps note names</strong>: DO, RE, MI,...

You can also turn off the automatic capitalization completely, in which case note names are simply rendered the way you type them.
<h4>Positioning</h4>
<strong>Distance to fretboard diagram</strong>: If a fretboard diagram is present, this value is the height at which the chord symbol is applied <em>above</em> the diagram (negative values can be used).

<strong>Minimum chord spacing</strong>: The space to leave between chord symbols.
<strong>Maximum barline distance</strong>: Changes the size of the gap between the last chord symbol in the measure and the following barline. 
You only need to adjust this value if there is a continuous problem in the score with overlap between the last symbol in one measure and the first symbol in the next.

<strong>Note</strong>: In addition to the settings described here, the default position of applied chord symbols is also determined by settings in the <a href="%7B#chord-symbol-text">Text Styles</a> dialog. 
The effect is cumulative.
<h4>Capo</h4>
Enter the number of the capo position at which you want to display substitute chords, in brackets, after all chord symbols in the score.
<h3>Nashville Number System</h3>
The Nashville Number System (NNS), available in MuseScore since version 3.3, is a shorthand way of representing chords based on scale degrees rather than chord letters. 

This allows an accompaniment to be played in any key from the same chord chart.
To start entering Nashville notation:
Select a start note;

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>→<samp>Nashville Number</samp>.

Just as with standard chord symbols, you can type Nashville notation normally and MuseScore will do its best to recognize and format the symbols appropriately. 

The same shortcuts used for navigation when entering standard chord symbols (e.g. 
<kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>, see <a href="#commands">above</a>)  are available for Nashville notation as well.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-02/nashville-120.png?itok=RmFnXsxq">


<h3>Roman Numeral Analysis</h3>
As of MuseScore 3.3, the <strong>Roman Numeral Analysis</strong> system is supported—a type of musical analysis where chords are represented by upper and lower case Roman numerals (I, ii, III, iv etc.), superscripts, subscripts and other modifying symbols. 
It is used to notate and analyze the harmony of a composition independent of its key (see <a href="#external-links">External links</a> for further details).

<strong>Note</strong>: Unlike standard chord symbols and Nashville notation, which MuseScore formats using its own algorithms, RNA uses the free and open source <a href="https://github.com/MarcSabatella/Campania">Campania font</a> to format the symbols. 
This allows MuseScore to format the symbols as you type, rather than applying the formatting only when you are done. 
Also, if you install the Campania font on your system normally, you can use it in other programs as well and benefit from the same formatting.

<h4>Enter RNA</h4>
Select a start note;
From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>→<samp>Roman Numeral Analysis</samp>. 

Alternatively, set up a keyboard shortcut to do the same thing in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">Preferences</a>;
Input the RNA symbols for the chord just like normal text, as follows;
<strong>Major chord</strong>: Upper case roman numerals

<strong>Minor chord</strong>: Lower case roman numerals
<strong>Diminished chord</strong>: o (lower case)
<strong>Half-diminished chord</strong>: 0 (zero)

<strong>Augmented chord</strong>: +
<strong>Chord inversions</strong>: Enter up to 3 single-digit numbers, top note first
<strong>Accidentals</strong>: # (sharp), b (flat)

For other symbols, see the images below, "<a href="#rna-examples">Examples of RNA</a>".
Move the cursor forward or backwards to continue entering or editing symbols for other chords;
When RNA is completed, exit by pressing <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>, or by clicking on a blank section of the score.

Just as with standard chord symbols, you can type Roman numeral analysis normally and MuseScore will do its best to recognize and format the symbols appropriately. 
The same shortcuts used for navigation when entering standard chord symbols are available for Roman numeral analysis as well (see <a href="#commands">Keyboard commands</a> (above)).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Fingering</span></h2>
Fingering symbols for various instruments are found in the Fingering <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in the Advanced workspace.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Fingering_0.png?itok=D140pS95">
<strong>Keyboard</strong> music employs the numbers 1–5 to represent fingers of the left or right hand.

<strong>Guitar</strong> music uses the numbers 0–4 to represent left-hand fingering (T is occasionally used for the thumb). 
Right-hand fingering is indicated by the letters p, i, m, a, c. 
Circled numbers represent instrument strings.

The last five symbols in the palette are used for <strong>lute</strong> fingering in historical music.
<em>Note</em>: <strong>To enable the display of fingering in tablature</strong>, right-click on the TAB, and select <samp>Staff/Part Properties...</samp>→<kbd><samp class="button">Advanced Style Properties</samp></kbd>; then check the box labelled  "Show fingering in tablature".
<h3>Add fingering to a single note</h3>
Use any of the following methods:
Select a note and click one of the fingering symbols in a Palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop a fingering symbol from a palette onto a note

When fingering is added to a note, the focus immediately shifts to the symbol, so you can adjust it right away.

<strong>Example</strong>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/adeste_0.png?itok=FkrBpegb">


<h4>Special characters</h4>
In most cases, lyrics can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> just like normal text. 
However, special keyboard shortcuts are required to enter the following characters:

<strong>Space character</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>- (hyphen)</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>_ (underscore)</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>_</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>_</kbd></kbd>).

<strong>Line feed</strong>: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd></kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd></kbd>) or <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd> (from the numeric keypad).
<h4>Verse numbers</h4>
To number verses, simply type the number (e.g. 

1.) and a <a href="#special-characters">space</a> before the first syllable. 
MuseScore will automatically align the numbers and first syllable correctly.
<h4>Melisma</h4>
A <strong>melisma</strong> is a syllable or word that extends over two or more notes. 
It is indicated by an underline extending from the base of a syllable to the last note of the melisma. 
The underline is created by positioning the cursor at the end of a syllable and pressing <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>_</kbd></kbd>: once for each note in the melisma. 

See the image below:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/lyrics1_1.png?itok=GtQoxTIl">
The above lyric was created in the following manner:
Type the letters, <kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>o</kbd><kbd>u</kbd><kbd>l</kbd><kbd>,</kbd></kbd>.

At the end of the word, press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>_</kbd><kbd>_</kbd><kbd>_</kbd>.</kbd>
Type the letters <kbd><kbd>T</kbd><kbd>o</kbd></kbd>, then press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>.
For non-last syllables to extend, just use additional dashes <kbd><kbd>-</kbd></kbd>, usually only one of them will show (more when the distance between the syllables is large enough), and the syllable will right-align to the first note, similar to last syllables that got notated with a melisma, see above.

<h4>Elision (Lyric) slur / Synalepha</h4>
Two syllables under a note can be joined with an <strong>elision slur</strong>, also known as a "lyric slur" or "synalepha". 
For example:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/synalepha_0.png?itok=ra5k8ci4">

To create the example lyric text, starting with the syllable text "te":
Type <kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>e</kbd></kbd>;

Click on the keyboard icon 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Keyboard_0.png?itok=kFCmiaMr">

in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or press <kbd><kbd>F2</kbd></kbd> to open the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing#symbols-and-special-characters">Special Characters</a> palette;

Use one of the following options:
Double-click one of the three elision slurs in the "Common Symbols" tab: "Narrow elision", "Elision", or "Wide elision" (these can be found between the "C Clef" and the "<strong><em>p</em></strong>" dynamic—see image below):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/special_characters_elision_en.png?itok=FR22xHOy">
Double-click the elision slur found after the 7/8 fraction in the "Common Symbols" tab (next to last character in the image above). 

Depending on the font, add one or more spaces before/after the slur using <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>Note</strong>: Not all fonts include the "undertie" character (U+203F  "undertie", present in "Special Characters" mainly for compatibility with MuseScore 1.x scores). 
To find out which fonts on your computer support it, see "<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/font/fontlist.htm?text=te%20%CD%9C%20A">fontlist</a>" (look for any font that shows a tie between "te" and "A" instead of a blank rectangle).

Type <kbd><kbd>A</kbd></kbd>.

As of 3.6: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>AltGr</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></kbd>).

Copy the lyrics from the text-file into the clipboard.
Select the start note in MuseScore, and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd></kbd>) (step 3 under <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lyrics#enter-lyrics">Enter lyrics in a score</a>).
Repeatedly applying <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste#paste-notes">paste</a> will enter successive words of the lyrics. 

You may need to enter melismas and make other corrections as you go along.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Rehearsal marks</span></h2>
<strong>Rehearsal marks</strong> can be used in a number of ways:

To identify specific points in a score to facilitate rehearsing.
As bookmarks in the score to which you can instantly navigate—using the <a href="#search">Find/Search</a> command.
To mark the various sections in the score.

Typically, <strong>rehearsal marks</strong> consist of one or more letters and/or numbers, and appear in sequence in the score—e.g. 
A, B, C…, or 1, 2, 3… etc. 
Alternatively, they may display measure numbers (usually larger than standard measure numbers, boldface and/or enclosed in boxes). 

Multimeasure rests are automatically broken before and after rehearsal marks.
Rehearsal marks can be added to the score (i) <em>automatically</em>—which ensures that they are named in sequence—or (ii) <em>manually</em>, allowing you to name them as you wish.
<h3>Add a rehearsal mark</h3>
<h4>Manual Placement</h4>
To create a rehearsal mark manually:
Click on a note (or rest) at the desired location;

Select one of the following options:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd></kbd>);
From the menu, choose <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Text</samp> → <samp>Rehearsal Mark</samp>;

Enter the desired text.
<h4>Automatic placement</h4>
<h5>Add an alphanumeric rehearsal mark</h5>
Use either of the following options:
Click on a note (or rest) at the desired location, then click the [B1] rehearsal mark icon in the "Text" <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop the rehearsal mark from the "Text" palette onto the score.

<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) By default, marks are added in the sequence, A, B, C etc. 
(2) To change the format of subsequently-added marks (to lower case letters, or numbers), edit the previous rehearsal mark accordingly. 
(3) Marks added between existing rehearsal marks append a number or letter to the previous mark: it is a good idea to apply the <a href="#resequence-rehearsal-marks">Resequence</a> command afterwards (see below).

<h5>Add a measure-number rehearsal mark</h5>
Add the first rehearsal mark in the series as an alphabetical one; then <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edit</a> it to read the <em>same</em> as the number of the measure it is attached to;
Add subsequent marks as shown <a href="#add-alphanumeric-mark">above</a>. 

They will automatically adopt the measure-number format.

<h3>Automatically resequence rehearsal marks</h3>
MuseScore allows the user to automatically re-order a series of rehearsal marks if they have got out of sequence for any reason. 
Use the following method:
Before making a selection, you can, if desired, establish a new format for the rehearsal marks (lower/upper case, number, or measure number) by manually altering the first mark in the range accordingly.

Select the range of measures you wish to apply the <strong>Resequence</strong> command to (if there is no selection then the program assumes you wish to resequence all measures).
From the menu, select <samp>Tools</samp> →  <samp>Resequence Rehearsal Marks</samp>.


MuseScore automatically detects the sequence based on the <em>first rehearsal mark</em> in the selection—all rehearsal marks in the selection are then altered accordingly. 
The following sequences are possible:
A, B, C etc.

a, b, c etc.
Numerical: 1, 2, 3 etc.
Numerical: according to measure numbers. 

This requires the number of the first mark in the series to be equal to the number of the measure it is attached to.
<h3>Text style</h3>
Rehearsal marks are a variety of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#system-text">system text</a>, appearing both on the score and on every <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">part</a>. 

By default, they are in a large bold font, and enclosed in frames. 
All aspects of their appearance can be changed globally via the rehearsal mark <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">Text style</a>.
<h3>Search for a rehearsal mark</h3>

<h2><br><span class="orange">Tempo</span></h2>
<strong>Tempo markings</strong> can be found in the Tempo <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> of the Basic and Advanced  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>. 
They are supplied as metronome marks, but can be subsequently edited to display any tempo or expression you want. 

Playback tempo can be varied throughout the score by using multiple tempo markings, visible or invisible.
<h3>Add a tempo marking</h3>
Use any of the following methods:

Select a note or rest and press the <strong>keyboard shortcut</strong> <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd>.
Select a note or rest, and from the <strong>menu bar</strong> choose <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text...</samp>→<samp>Tempo Marking</samp>.
Select a note or rest and click an appropriate metronome mark in the <strong>Tempo</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (double-click in versions prior to 3.4);

Drag-and-drop a metronome mark from the <strong>Tempo</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> directly onto a note or rest.
<strong>Note</strong>: If a tempo marking is applied from the menu or using a keyboard shortcut, the beat note automatically follows the time signature. 
The advantage of applying from a palette is that <em>you</em> can choose which beat note to use.

<h3>Edit tempo</h3>
To change the tempo of an existing metronome mark in the score:
Go into <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing#text-edit-mode">Edit mode</a> on the tempo mark in question;

Edit the metronome number and/or the beat note as required;
Exit Edit mode.


You can also override the tempo of an existing metronome mark from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>:
Select the tempo mark;
Untick "Follow text" in the <strong>Tempo text</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>;


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/inspector_tempo_text.PNG?itok=Q9FQOeeA">

Set the desired playback tempo in the "Tempo" field underneath.


<strong>Note</strong>: Playback may be faster or slower if the tempo setting in the <a href="#play-panel">play panel</a> is at a percentage other than 100%.
<h3>Edit tempo text</h3>
Tempo marks can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> and formatted just like any other <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> object. 

To set text properties or text style, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">Text styles and properties</a>.
The tempo indicated by a metronome mark usually persists even if overwritten by an expression—such as Andante, Moderato etc. 
You can also <em>add</em> further text to a plain metronome mark. 

e.g.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/met_mark_5.jpg?itok=OJpHr6Ur">
<h3>Overriding the tempo marking</h3>
You can temporarily override the indicated <a href="#tempo-marking">tempo</a>, and play the score back at any tempo you like using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/play-mode#play-panel">play panel</a>:

Display the play panel: <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Play Panel</samp> or <kbd><kbd>F11</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd></kbd>):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/play_panel_v3_en.png?itok=pxhLwrSj">

Move the tempo slider up or down as required. 

The tempo is shown both as an absolute value and as a percentage of the currently indicated tempo mark. 
Double-click the tempo slider to reset it.


<em>Note:</em> BPM is always measured and displayed in quarter note beats per minute, regardless of the (denominator of the) time signature in effect.
<h3>Ritardando and accelerando playback</h3>
You can simulate <strong>ritardando</strong> ("<em>rit.</em>") and <strong>accelerando</strong> ("<em>accel.</em>") playback by adding hidden tempo markings to the score. 

The printed indication to the musician should be added as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">staff/system text</a> in addition.
In the example illustrated below, the tempo was originally 110 BPM (beats per minute). 
At the ritardando, the tempo decreases by 10 BPM on the first note of each measure. 

Each tempo change is made invisible by unchecking the <strong>Visible</strong> checkbox in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, so that only the ritardando shows on the printed score:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/ritardando_0.png?itok=GH7CUzdd">

A <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins">plugin</a> has been developed to automate this process: <em><a href="https://musescore.org/project/tempochanges">TempoChanges</a></em>

<h3>Fermatas</h3>
Fermatas, available in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/articulations-and-ornaments">Articulations and Ornaments</a> palette, have a <strong>Time stretch</strong> property that can be set via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
By default, this property is set to 1.00. 

To have MuseScore play back a fermata for twice its normal duration, click on the fermata and set "Time stretch" to 2.00. 
This of course does not work for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/articulations-and-ornaments#barline">fermatas applied to barlines</a>, as barlines don't have a duration to stretch.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Dynamics</span></h2>
<strong>Dynamics</strong> are symbols indicating the relative loudness of a note or phrase of music. 
They can be found in the Dynamics <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in either the Basic or Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#workspaces">workspace</a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Dynamics.png?itok=ODZ-ejaE">

Additional dynamics are available in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/master-palette">Master Palette</a> (<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>).
<strong>Note</strong>:  if you wish to adjust the <em>overall</em> playback volume of the score, use the volume slider in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/play-mode#play-panel">Play Panel</a>, or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/synthesizer">Synthesizer</a>.

<h3>Add a dynamic</h3>
<strong>To apply a dynamic to the score</strong>, use one of the following methods:
Select a note and click a dynamic symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag a dynamic symbol from a palette onto a note.
<strong>To create a crescendo or decrescendo</strong>, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/hairpins">Hairpin</a>.
<h3>Adjust properties</h3>
The default dynamic of the score is <strong><em>mf</em></strong> (mezzoforte)—set at MIDI velocity 80 (out of 127). 
Depending on the dynamic governing a particular section of the score, velocity (and the resulting loudness) may be less than or greater than this.
<h4>To edit the velocity of a dynamic</h4>
Select the dynamic and, in the <strong>Dynamic</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> edit the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#velocity">Velocity</a> value—higher for louder, lower for softer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-09/Velocity_speed.png?itok=4CjhZ19u">

<h4>To adjust the range</h4>
<em>Note</em>: Range = the staves in the system affected by the dynamic.
Select the dynamic, and in the <strong>Dynamic</strong> section of the <strong>Inspector</strong>, choose an option from "Dynamic range". 
The default is "Part," which means that all staves for a particular instrument will be affected. 

"Staff" limits the effect to the staff attached to the dynamic. 
"System" means that all staves in the system will be affected by the dynamic.
<h4>To change the placement (above or below stave)</h4>
For a single dynamic mark: select the dynamic, and type <kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd> to flip the placement or use the Inspector, see below.
For all dynamic marks on a stave:
Right-click on one dynamic, then choose <em>Select &gt; All Similar Elements on Same Stave</em>

In the <strong>Dynamic</strong> section of the <strong>Inspector</strong> choose the required option <em>Above</em> or <em>Below</em> from "Placement"

For all dynamic marks in the score:


See above, then use the "Set as Style" button of Inspector
<h3>Customize a dynamic</h3>
Dynamics can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> just like any other text object. 

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing#special-character-shortcuts">Special character shortcuts</a> can be used to add the following symbols:
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Piano <em>p</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Forte <em>f</em></strong>.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Mezzo <em>m</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Rinforzando <em>r</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></kbd>: <strong>Sforzando <em>s</em></strong>.

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Niente <em>n</em></strong>.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd>): <strong>Z <em>z</em></strong>.
You can also edit the velocity and range etc. 

(see <a href="#adjust-properties">above</a>). 
If desired, you can save the result for future use in a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">custom palette</a>.
<h3>Single Note Dynamics (SND)</h3>
As of version 3.1, MuseScore supports <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#single-note-dynamic">single note dynamics</a>. 
In addition to <a href="#edit-velocity">editing the velocity</a>, you can also edit the velocity change in the inspector. 
Entering a number into this field will change the velocity of the note by approximately that amount after the initial velocity is played. 

A negative number can be used to lower the volume after the initial note and a positive number will make the note play louder after the initial volume. 
See links (below) for further details.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Swing</span></h2>

MuseScore's <strong>swing</strong> feature allows you to change the playback of your score from a straight to a swing rhythm. 
Swing can be applied globally or only to a section of the score, and is fully variable.
<h3>Apply swing to a score section</h3>
To apply swing to <em>all</em> staves in a system:
Click on the note where you want swing to start;
Click <strong>Swing</strong> in the Text palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4);


This inserts a System Text object which affects all staves in the system with a default swing percentage of 60%.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the Swing text as required;
If you need to vary swing from the default setting, right-click the Swing text and select <samp>System text properties...</samp> Click on the "Swing Settings" tab and adjust note duration and "Swing ratio" as required.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-01/Swing_Settings_EN.png?itok=tMfuJhcu">

To apply swing only to <em>specific</em> staves in a system:
Click on the note where you want swing to start;

Add <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">Staff text</a>;
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the appearance of the text as required;
Right-click on the text, select <samp>Staff Text Properties...</samp>, and click on the "Swing settings" tab. 

Modify as required;
Repeat steps 1–4 for other staves if needed.


Swing text can be <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">edited</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-basics#text-formatting">formatted</a> just like any other text object.
<h4>Triplet in tempo marking</h4>
Often this notation is used to indicate swing:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-06/swing_markings.png?itok=6PEKrC09, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-06/swing_markings.png?itok=z5GxnIKs 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_1480/public/2019-06/swing_markings.png?itok=QBtwVbFn">
MuseScore does not have a way to include a triplet in text as a tempo marking, but there is an easy workaround:
Add Swing text as described <a href="#setup">above</a> and make it invisible (shortcut <kbd><kbd>V</kbd></kbd>, or untick "Visible" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>);

Add an appropriate <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/images">Image</a> of the required tempo marking to the score. 
These can be downloaded from the bottom of the "How To" page: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/266325">How to create a visual swing marking</a>.
Resize and reposition the image as required.

<h3>Return to straight rhythm</h3>
If you want playback to return to straight time after a swing section, use one of the following options:
<strong>From version 3.4</strong>:

Add <strong>Straight</strong> text from the "More" field of the Workspace's text palette to the first note or rest of the "straight" section (see <a href="#setup">above</a>).
<strong>Prior to version 3.4</strong>:
Add <strong>Swing</strong> text to the first note or rest of the "straight" section  (see <a href="#setup">above</a>).

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Edit</a> the text to indicate a return to straight time: e.g. 
"Straight."
Right-click on the text and select <samp>System Text Properties…</samp>. 

Click on the "Swing Settings" tab and set "Swing to "Off."
<h3>Apply swing globally</h3>
If you wish to apply swing to the whole score, you can do so from the menu:

Select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> → <samp>Score</samp>.
In the "Swing Settings" section, set the desired note value and "swing ratio."

<h2><br><span class="orange">Mid-staff instrument changes</span></h2>

When a musician is required to double on a different instrument for a section of a piece, the instruction to switch instruments is generally placed above the staff at the beginning of that section. 
A return to the primary instrument is handled in the same manner.
MuseScore enables users to insert a special class of text called <strong>Change Instrument</strong> text for this purpose. 

This class of text is different from either <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#staff-text">Staff</a> or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text#system-text">System</a> text in that it links the text to the playback and changes the sound to the new instrument.
<h3>Effect of instrument change</h3>
When an instrument change is made:

The sound played will be changed to that of the new instrument from that point onward, but the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">mixer</a> display remains unchanged.
Subsequent notes are automatically adjusted to indicate the correct <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/concert-pitch">written pitch</a> for the new instrument (but the new <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/key-signatures#add">key signature</a> still needs to be added manually—see <a href="#add-instrument-change">below</a>).
The new instrument name will be displayed in front of the following systems.

<h3>Add an instrument change</h3>
Select the start point of the change by clicking on a note or rest;
Open the main palette by typing F9 (or from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#show-panels">View menu</a>), and click on <strong>Text</strong> to open the text sub-palette:


<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/Change-instrument-Text_en.png?itok=QU1REMwm">
A click on the <strong>Change Instr</strong>  text in the palette opens the dialog (double-click in versions prior to 3.4)

The top box shows the current instrument, the bottom the list of selectable instruments;

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Change-instrument-Select_en.png?itok=v9URwkQi">


Choose the instrument, then click OK. 
When an instrument is selected and the OK button is pressed, the text indicating which instrument the player will use appears in the score.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/key-signatures#add">Insert a new key signature</a>, if required, at the change, for the staff in question.

<strong>Note</strong>: Mid-staff instrument changes are limited to the <em>same type of staff</em>. 
For example, you cannot change between a percussion staff and a pitched instrument staff or vice versa.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Repeats and jumps</span></h2>
<h3>Simple repeats</h3>
You can create a <strong>simple repeat</strong> by placing a <strong>start</strong> and an <strong>end repeat</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/barlines">barline</a> at the beginning and end of a passage. 

These can be applied from the <em>Barlines</em> or <em>Repeats &amp; Jumps</em> palette.

<strong>Note</strong>: If the start of a repeat coincides with the <em>beginning</em> of a piece or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section</a>, the start repeat barline can be omitted if desired. 

Similarly, an end repeat barline can be omitted at the <em>end</em> of a score or section.

Ensure that the start and end barlines are correctly positioned. 

For a volta section, ensure that each volta, except the last one, terminates with an end repeat barline.
<strong>In the case of a simple repeat</strong>, where more than one repeat is needed, right-click on the measure containing the end repeat barline and select <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#properties">Measure properties</a>. 
Adjust <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#play-count">Play count</a> so that it is equal to the number of times you want the section to play back.

<strong>In the case of a complex volta section</strong>, such as the following:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-04/volta_example.png?itok=qujDIBsk">


Make sure that the volta "Repeat list" is set up correctly—see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas#volta-properties">Volta properties</a>. 

Right-click on the measure containing the end repeat barline and select <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#properties">Measure properties</a>. 
Adjust <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#play-count">Play count</a> so that it is one greater than the number of measures listed in the Volta "Repeat list." In this case, since 5 measures are listed, the "Play count" needs to be set to 6.


<h3>Repeat symbols and text</h3>
Text and symbols related to repeats are located in the "<strong>Repeats &amp; Jumps</strong>" <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> (in the Basic and Advanced workspaces). 
This palette contains:

Symbols for measure repeat, Segno, Segno Variation (Serpent), Coda, and Coda Variation (Codetta)
D.S., D.C., al Coda, al Fine, To Coda, and Fine text
Repeat barlines

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-08/Palette-Repeats.png?itok=ZPZqSavi">

To add a <strong>repeat</strong> symbol to the score use either of the following:
Select a measure, then click the desired repeat symbol in the palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag and drop a repeat symbol from the palette <em>onto</em> (not above!) the desired measure (so the measure changes color).
<h3>Jumps</h3>
<strong>Jumps</strong> are symbols in the score which tell the musician to skip to a named <a href="#markers">marker</a> (see below). 

Jumps include the various kinds of D.C. 
(Da Capo) and D.S. 
(Dal Segno) text.

To set correct playback of jumps:
Make sure that the "Play Repeats" 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Button-Play_Repeats.png?itok=fZc-ASP1">
button on the toolbar is selected. 

This is a toggle, so you can turn off playback by clicking the same button.
<em>After</em> the jump, and following established convention, only the last round of any simple repeat section is played back. 
If you want playback to take these repeats in full:

Select the applicable jump symbol;
In the "Jump" section of the Inspector, check "Play Repeats".


<strong>Note</strong>: Jumps are taken only after all simple repeats in the section are played through.
If you click on a <em>jump</em>, some text boxes and a checkbox are displayed in the <strong>Jump</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
These have the following effects on playback:

<strong>Jump to</strong>: Playback jumps to the <a href="#markers">marker</a> whose "Label" is the same as the "Jump to" tag.
<strong>Play until</strong>: Playback continues until it reaches a <a href="#markers">marker</a> whose "Label" is the same as the "Play until" tag.
<strong>Continue at</strong>: Playback jumps to the next <a href="#markers">marker</a>  whose "Label" is the same as the "Continue" tag.

<strong>Play repeats</strong>: Ticking this box tells MuseScore to play repeats after D.C. 
(Da Capo) or D.S. 
(Dal Segno) jumps. 

If this option is not ticked then <a href="#simple-repeats">simple Repeats</a> are not taken after jumps and playback works as if it were the last repeat.
<strong>Note</strong>: The tags <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>, referring to the beginning and end of a score or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section</a>, are <em>implicit</em> and don't need to be added by the user.
<h3>Markers</h3>
<strong>Markers</strong> are the places referred to by the <a href="#jumps">jumps</a>. 
A list of markers (in addition to the implicit "start" and "end") follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/dal_segno.png?itok=eUdzvtHs">


: Segno (tag: <em>segno</em>)
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/dal_segno_var.png?itok=O4AeH7kk">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-06/coda_var.png?itok=AF5Pq-85">

: Coda Variation (tag: <em>varcoda</em>)

<strong>Fine</strong>: (tag: <em>fine</em>)
<strong>To Coda</strong>: (tag: <em>coda</em>)
If you click on a marker, the following properties appears in the <strong>Marker</strong> section of the Inspector:

<strong>Marker type</strong>: This can be changed from the dropdown list, if required.
<strong>Label</strong>: This is the (identifier) tag associated with the marker. 
See also, <a href="#jumps">Jumps</a> (above).

<h3>Examples of jumps</h3>
<strong>Da Capo (D.C.)</strong>: At the "D.C." sign, playback jumps to the start (i.e. 
to the implicit <em>start</em> tag) and plays the entire score or section again (i.e. 

up to the implicit <em>end</em> tag).
<strong>Da Capo (D.C.) al Fine</strong>: At the "D.C. 
al Fine" sign, playback jumps to the start (i.e. 

to the implicit <em>start</em> tag) and plays the score up to the <strong>Fine</strong> (i.e. 
the <em>fine</em> tag).
<strong>Dal Segno (D.S.) al Fine</strong>: At the "D.S. 

al Fine" sign, playback jumps to the <strong>Segno</strong> symbol (i.e. 
the <em>segno</em> tag) and then plays up to the <strong>Fine</strong> (i.e. 
the <em>fine</em> tag)

<strong>Dal Segno (D.S.) al Coda</strong>: At the "D.S. 
al Coda" sign, playback jumps to the <strong>Segno</strong> symbol (i.e. 
the <em>segno</em> tag) and then plays up to the <strong>To Coda</strong> (i.e. 

the <em>coda</em> tag). 
Playback then continues at the <strong>Coda</strong> symbol (i.e. 
the <em>codab</em> tag).

<strong>Note</strong>: The properties (i.e. 
the tag names) of jumps and markers can be set via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-02/multiple%20jumps.png?itok=2g5UU1L_">


You need to modify them if using multiple jumps and markers.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Figured bass</span></h2>
<h3>Adding a new figured bass indication</h3>
Select the note to which the figured bass applies;
Press the <strong>Figured Bass</strong> shortcut. 
The default is<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd></kbd>): this can be changed in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">Prefences: Shortcuts</a> if desired;

Enter the text in the editor 'blue box' as required (see below);
Use one of the following options as required:
Press <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to move to the next note ready for another figured bass indication (or click outside the editor box to exit it). 

The editor advances to the next note, or to the rest of the staff to which figured bass is being added. 
(To move to a point in between, or to extend a figured bass group for a longer duration, see <a href="#duration">Duration</a> (below)).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/trunk_fb_sample_1_1.png?itok=io9DCQms">


<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> moves the editing box to the previous staff note or rest.
<kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> advances the editing box to the beginning of the next measure.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> moves the editing box to the beginning of the previous measure.


<h3>Text format</h3>
<h4>Digits</h4>
Digits are entered directly. 
Groups of several digits stacked one above the other are also entered directly in a single text, stacking them with <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_sample_2_0.png?itok=ggu-Axx8">


<h4>Accidentals</h4>
Accidentals can be entered using regular keys:
<table>

<thead><tr>
<th><em>To enter:</em></th>
<th><em>type:</em></th>

</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>double flat</td>
<td>bb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>flat</td>
<td>b</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>natural</td>

<td>h</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>sharp</td>
<td>#</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>double sharp</td>
<td>##</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These characters will automatically turn into the proper signs when you leave the editor. 
Accidentals can be entered before, or after a digit (and of course, in place of a digit, for altered thirds), according to the required style; both styles are properly aligned, with the accidental 'hanging' at the left, or the right.
<h4>Combined shapes</h4>
Slashed digits or digits with a cross can be entered by adding <kbd><kbd>\</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>/</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd> after the digit (combining suffixes); the proper combined shape will be substituted when leaving the editor:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/trunk_fb_sample_3_0.png?itok=2U-kjsrx">

The built-in font can manage combination equivalence, favoring the more common substitution:

1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ result in 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_modern_1.png?itok=UIUPEjBA">
(or 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_historic_1.png?itok=hYz8aRe3">


)
and 5\, 6\, 7\, 8\, 9\ result in 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_modern_2.png?itok=uUSHgZJo">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_historic_2.png?itok=JAwLWcCl">

)

Please remember that <kbd><kbd>/</kbd></kbd> can only by combined with <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd>; any other 'slashed' figure is rendered with a question mark.
<kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd> can also be used before a digit; in this case it is not combined, but it is properly aligned ('+' hanging at the left side).
<h4>Parentheses</h4>
Open and closed parentheses, both round: '(', ')' and square: '[', ']', can be inserted before and after accidentals, before and after a digit, before and after a continuation line; added parentheses will not disturb the proper alignment of the main character.
<em>Notes</em>: (1) The editor does not check that parentheses, open and closed, round or square, are properly balanced. 
(2) Several parentheses in a row are non-syntactical and prevent proper recognition of the entered text. 

(3) A parenthesis between a digit and a combining suffix ('+', '\', '/') is accepted, but prevents shape combination.
<h4>Continuation lines</h4>
Continuation lines are input by adding an '_' (underscore) at the end of the line. 

Each digit of a group can have its own continuation line:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/trunk_fb_sample_4_0.png?itok=PTKoUYwy">
Continuation lines are drawn for the whole duration of the figured bass group.
<strong>'Extended' continuation lines</strong>

Occasionally, a continuation line has to connect with the continuation line of a following group, when a chord degree has to be kept across two groups. 
Examples (both from J. 
Boismortier, <em>Pièces de viole</em>, op. 

31, Paris 1730):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_sample_4_b_0.png?itok=S7BoslVc">

In the first case, each group has its own continuation line; in the second, the continuation line of the first group is carried 'into' the second.

This can be obtained by entering several (two or more) underscores "__" at the end of the text line of the first group.
<h4>Duration</h4>
Each figured bass group has a duration, which is indicated by a light gray line above it (of course, this line is for information only and it is not printed or exported to PDF).

Initially, a group has the same duration of the note to which it is attached. 
A different duration may be required to fit several groups under a single note or to extend a group to span several notes.
To achieve this, each key combination in the table below can be used to (1) advance the editing box by the indicated duration, and (2) set the duration of the previous group up to the new editing box position.

Pressing several of them in sequence without entering any figured bass text repeatedly extends the previous group.

(The digits are the same as are used to set the note durations)

Setting the exact figured bass group duration is only mandatory in two cases:
When several groups are fit under a single staff note (there is no other way).
When continuation lines are used, as line length depends on the group duration.

However, it is a good practice to always set the duration to the intended value for the purposes of plugins and MusicXML.
<h3>Editing existing figured basses</h3>
To edit a figured bass indication already entered use one of the following options:

Select it, or the note it belongs to and press the same <em>Figured Bass</em> shortcut used to create a new one.
Double-click it.
The usual text editor box will open with the text converted back to plain characters ('b', '#' and 'h' for accidentals, separate combining suffixes, underscores, etc.) for simpler editing.

Once done, press <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to move to a next note, or click outside the editor box to exit it, as for newly created figured basses.
<h3>Style</h3>
To configure how figured bass is rendered: from the menu, select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style…</samp> → <samp>Figured Bass</samp>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/format_style_figured_bass_en_.png?itok=3f2wYjE4">
<strong>Font</strong>: The dropdown list contains all the fonts which have been configured for figured bass. 
A standard installation contains only one font, "MuseScore Figured Bass," which is also the default font.
<strong>Size</strong>: Select a font-size in points. 

<em>Note</em>: This value is also modified by any change made to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#scaling">Scaling</a> (<samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Page Settings</samp>…), or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Scale</a> ("Staff properties").
<strong>Vertical Position</strong>: The distance (in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">spaces</a>) from the top of the staff to the top margin of the figured bass text. 
Negative values go up (figured bass above the staff) and positive values go down (figured bass below the staff: a value greater than 4 is needed to step over the staff itself).

<strong>Line Height</strong>: The distance between the base line of each figured bass line, as a percentage of font size.
The following picture visualizes each numeric parameter:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_param_0.png?itok=E5GCq2uC">


<strong>Alignment</strong>: Select the vertical alignment: with <em>Top</em>, the top line of each group is aligned with the main vertical position and the group 'hangs' from it (this is normally used with figured bass notation and is the default); with <em>Bottom</em>, the bottom line is aligned with the main vertical position and the group 'sits' on it (this is sometimes used in some kinds of harmonic analysis notations):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_vertalign.png?itok=ntIGzdlK">
<strong>Style</strong>: Choose between "Modern" or "Historic." The difference between the two styles is shown below:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_sample_5.png?itok=fz9uiKPA">


<h3>Proper syntax</h3>
For the relevant substitutions and shape combinations to take effect and for proper alignment, the figured bass mechanism expects input texts to follow some rules (which are in any case, the rules for a syntactical figured bass indication):
There can be only one accidental (before or after), or only one combining suffix per figure;

There cannot be both an accidental <strong>and</strong> a combining suffix;
There can be an accidental without a digit (altered third), but not a combining suffix without a digit.
Any other character not listed above is not expected.

If a text entered does not follow these rules, it will not be processed: it will be stored and displayed as it is, without any layout.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Frames</span></h2>
A <strong>Frame</strong> is a rectangular container for empty space, text or pictures in the score. 
It can be one of three types:

<a href="#horizontal">Horizontal</a>: Used to create a break in a particular system. 
Can contain one or more text objects and/or images.
<a href="#vertical">Vertical</a>: Inserted above a system or appended to the last system. 

Can contain one or more text objects and/or images.
<a href="#text">Text</a>: Inserted above a system or appended to the last system. 
Can contain one text object only.

<h3>Horizontal frame</h3>
A <strong>horizontal frame</strong> is used to create a break in a system. 
For example, you can:

Create a coda, with an adjustable gap separating it from the rest of the score (as in the example below).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Horizontal_Frame_0.png?itok=gLt4btPe">

Create an offset at the beginning of the score, where there is no staff name to perform the same function.

Create an adjustable right margin at the end of a system.
Create space for some text or image(s).
Create a space between a 'historical incipit' and the beginning of the modern edition.

<h4>Insert/append horizontal frame</h4>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#create-a-frame">Create a Frame</a> (below).
<h4>Adjust width of horizontal frame</h4>
Use one of the following methods:
Click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the frame and drag the handle to the right or left.
Select the frame and adjust "Width" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

<h4>Add text or image to horizontal frame</h4>
<strong>To add text</strong>: Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Text</samp>.
<strong>To add an image</strong>: Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Picture</samp>.

<h3>Vertical frame</h3>
A <strong>vertical frame</strong> can be inserted above a system or appended to the last system. 
It can contain one or more text objects and/or images. 

The height is adjustable and the width equals the system width.
It can be used, for example, to:
Create an area at the head of a score for Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist text etc. 

(see <a href="#add-text-image-vf">below</a>).
Create a title page (see <a href="#external-links">below</a>).
Add single- or multi-column lyric text (at the end of a score).

Create subtitles and other annotations between systems.
<h4>Insert/append vertical frame</h4>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#create-a-frame">Create a Frame</a> (below).

<h4>Adjust height of vertical frame</h4>

Click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the frame and drag the handle up or down.

Select the frame and adjust "Height" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<h4>Edit vertical frame properties</h4>
Selecting the frame allows you to adjust various parameters in the Inspector:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/inspector_vertical_frame.PNG?itok=hdMVii2q">
<strong>Top Gap</strong>: Adjusts distance between frame and element above.
<strong>Bottom Gap</strong>: Adjusts distance between frame and element below.
<strong>Height</strong>: Adjusts height of the frame.
<strong>Left Margin</strong>: Moves left-aligned text objects to the right.
<strong>Right Margin</strong>: Moves right-aligned text objects to the left.
<strong>Top margin</strong>: Moves top-aligned text objects downwards (see also <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> → <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-page">Page</a>).
<strong>Bottom Margin</strong>: Moves bottom-aligned text objects upwards (see also <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> → <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-page">Page</a>).
<h4>Add text or image to vertical frame</h4>
<strong>To add text</strong>: Right-click on the frame, select <samp>Add</samp>, and choose one of the text options.

<strong>To add an image</strong>: Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Picture</samp>.
You can create as many objects as you like within a frame. 
Their positions can be adjusted independently by dragging or, more accurately, by altering the offset values in the Inspector. 

To format text objects, see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Text editing</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">Text styles and properties</a>.
<h4>Insert horizontal frame in vertical frame</h4>
Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Insert Horizontal Frame</samp>.

The <a href="#horizontal">horizontal frame</a> is automatically <em>left-aligned</em> and fills the entire vertical frame. 
To <em>right-align</em> it:
Reduce the <a href="#edit-width-hf">width</a> of the horizontal frame.

Deselect the frame then drag it to the right. 
To restore left-alignment, drag the frame to the left.


<h4>"Title" frame</h4>
A vertical frame is automatically created at the beginning of a score, showing the title, subtitle, composer, lyricist etc., when you fill in the information fields provided on page 1 of the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#enter-score-information">New Score Wizard</a>.
If the score does not have a vertical frame at the beginning, you can create one as follows:

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Text</samp> → <samp>Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist</samp>;
Type the desired text;
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>, or click on an empty space, to exit.

<h3>Text frame</h3>
A <strong>Text frame</strong> looks like a <a href="#vertical">vertical frame</a>, but is specialized for text input: <em>one</em> text object is allowed per frame. 
The height automatically expands to fit the content and there is no height adjustment handle.

A text frame can be used, for example, to:
Create lyric text at the end of a score.
Create subtitles and other annotations between systems.

Create and insert an empty [blank] page anywhere in the score, including at the beginning.
<h4>Insert/ append text frame</h4>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#create-a-frame">Create a Frame</a> (below).

<h4>Edit text frame properties</h4>

<h2><br><span class="orange">Lines</span></h2>
The <strong>Lines</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> of the Advanced workspace contains the following lines:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Palette-Lines_0.png?itok=bts2f5Tq">

As you can see, the palette includes: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs">Slurs</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/hairpins">Hairpins</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Volta brackets</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/octave-lines">Octave lines</a>, and many others.
<h3>Applying lines to the score</h3>
Most lines (except <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/slurs">Slurs</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Volta brackets</a>  and the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/early-music-features#ambitus">Ambitus</a>) can be applied from a palette in the following ways:
<h4>To apply a line to <em>just</em> one note</h4>
Click on a note, then <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></kbd> on the next note;

In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

<h4>To apply a line across a range of notes</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#shift-click-selection">range</a> of notes;
In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).


<h4>To apply a line from a note to the end of that measure</h4>
Use any of the following methods:
Click on a note, then, in a palette, click on a line (double-click the latter in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag and drop a line onto the score.
<h4>To apply a line across a range of measures</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#select-measure">Select</a> one or more measures;

In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

<h3>Lines and playback properties</h3>
Some lines, such as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/hairpins">Hairpins</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Voltas</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/octave-lines">Ottavas</a> etc., also have an effect on the <em>playback</em> of the score itself. 
Each <strong>end handle</strong> is connected by a dotted line to an <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#anchor">anchor</a> on the staff (visible in  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">Edit mode</a>). 
These anchors indicate the <em>extent</em> of the playback effect.

<h3>Adjust vertical position</h3>
In <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#normal-mode">Normal mode</a>, apply one of the following methods:
Click on one or more lines and change the vertical offset in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Inspector</a>;

Click on a line, press and hold <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and drag it up/down with a mouse.
<strong>Note</strong>: You can also adjust the vertical position in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#lines">Edit</a> mode.
<h3>Change length</h3>
<strong>Note</strong>: The following two methods move the end of the line <em>and</em> its <a href="#lines-playback-properties">anchor</a> <em>together</em>. 
This ensures that correct playback of the score is maintained (if applicable), and that the line can be extended between <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#system">systems</a> if required.
<h4>Using keyboard shortcuts</h4>
Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">Edit mode</a> and click on an end handle;
Apply one of the following shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle, and its anchor, to the right by one note (or, in the case of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">Voltas</a>, one measure)

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the end handle, and its anchor, to the left by one note (or, in the case of Voltas, one measure);

<h4>By dragging (as of version 3.5)</h4>
Click on the end handle of a line and drag it with the mouse.
<h4>Fine adjustment</h4>
To make <strong>fine adjustments</strong> to the position of the line end (without changing the position of the anchor):

Enter <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#enter-exit">Edit mode</a> and click on an end handle;
Apply one of the following shortcuts:
<kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to move the handle right by 0.1 <strong>sp</strong> (1 sp = one staff space = the distance between two staff lines).

<kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd> to move the handle left 0.1 sp.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>) to move the handle right one sp.
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd>) to move the handle left one sp.


<h3>Text lines</h3>
A <strong>text line</strong> is a line that has <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text">text</a> embedded within it—such as a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voltas">volta</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/octave-lines">ottava</a>, guitar barre line etc.

When you apply a text line to the score from a palette, the <em>line</em> properties always remain unchanged, but the <em>text</em> properties may, under certain circumstances, assume those of the current <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">style</a> for text lines. 
For details, see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#text-line-behavior">Behavior of applied text and lines</a>.
<h3>Custom lines</h3>
Any line in the score can be customized by adjusting its properties in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, as follows:
Select the line;
If <em>line hooks</em> are needed, make a selection from <strong>Begin hook</strong>, <strong>End hook</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> (in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#text-line-core">Text Line Core</a> section);

To add <em>text</em>, tick <strong>Begin Text</strong>, <strong>Continue Text</strong> or <strong>End Text</strong>, then type in the "Text" box:
<strong>Begin</strong>: Text added here appears at the beginning of the line;
<strong>Continue</strong>: Text added here appears at the beginning of a continuation line (in the next system, if any);

<strong>End</strong>: Text added here appears at the end of the line;
Edit <em>text properties</em> and <em>alignment</em> as required;
Edit <strong>Placement</strong>: "Above" or "Below" sets the text so that it is on the line. 

"Left" places the text to the left of the line;
Make adjustments to the line color, thickness and style (solid, dashed etc.) in the <strong>Line</strong> section. 
The <strong>Diagonal</strong> option allows you to create a diagonal line by dragging the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#lines">end handles</a>;

To save the result for future use, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">Custom palettes</a>.

<h3>Copying lines</h3>
Once applied to the score, lines cannot be copied using the usual <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste">copy and paste</a> procedures. 
However, you can <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste#duplicate">duplicate</a> lines within a score:
Press and hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>), click on the line and drag it to the desired location.

<h3>Extended ornament lines</h3>
To add an accidental to an extended ornament (e.g. 
a trill line), select the line and click on a symbol in the Accidentals palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Measure</span></h2>
To open the <strong>Measure</strong> dialog, select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp>Measure</samp>.

This allows you to adjust the distance between various items within measures.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
If you change a <strong>measure style</strong> property, MuseScore automatically adjusts the score to maintain the correct spacing between notes and rests according to best music engraving practice. 

It will also correctly reposition any <em>elements</em> attached to notes or rests, such as fingerings, dynamics, lines etc.
All settings related to measure width and note spacing are <em>minimum</em> values. 
Measures are automatically stretched, if necessary, to maintain existing <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#page-margins">page margins</a>.

All the properties listed below use the <strong>staff space</strong> (abbreviated to "sp") as the basic unit of measurement. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#scaling">Page settings: Scaling</a> for more details.
<h3>Options</h3>
<strong>Minimum measure width</strong>: Sets the minimum horizontal length of measures. 
In measures containing very little content (e.g., a single whole note or whole measure rest), the measure will only shrink as far as this minimum.
<strong>Spacing (1=tight)</strong>: Condenses or expands the space <em>after</em> notes or rests. 

This setting thus affects not only space between notes but also between the last note and the ending barline. 
For the space between the <em>beginning</em> of the measure and the first note or rest, see <strong>Note left margin</strong> (below).
<strong>Note left margin</strong>: Sets the distance from the start barline to the first note.

<strong>Barline to grace note distance</strong>:  Sets the distance between a barline and a grace note that occurs before the first actual note in a measure (independently of the "Note left margin" setting).
<strong>Barline to accidental distance</strong>:  Sets the distance between a barline and an accidental placed before the first note in a measure (independently of the "Note left margin" setting).
<strong>Note to barline distance</strong>:  Sets the distance from the  last note to the following barline.

<strong>Minimum note distance</strong>:  Specifies the smallest amount of space MuseScore will allow after each note (depending on other factors, <em>more</em> space may be allowed).
<strong>Clef left margin</strong>:  Sets the distance between the very beginning of each line and the clef. 
(This option is rarely needed.)

<strong>Key signature left margin</strong>:  Sets the distance between the beginning of the measure and a key signature.
<strong>Time signature left margin</strong>:  Sets the distance between the beginning of the measure and a time signature (if there is no key signature in between).
<strong>Time signature to barline distance</strong>: To be added

<strong>Clef/key right margin</strong>:  Sets the distance between a mid-staff clef or key signature and the following note or rest.
<strong>Clef to barline distance</strong>: Sets the distance between a barline and a clef change preceding it.
<strong>Clef to key distance</strong>: Sets the distance from the clef to a key signature following it.

<strong>Clef to time signature distance</strong>: Sets the distance from the clef to the time signature following it (if there is no key signature in between).
<strong>Key to time signature distance</strong>: Sets the distance from a key signature to the following time signature.
<strong>Key to barline distance</strong>: To be added..

<strong>System header distance</strong>: Sets the distance from a clef or key signature at the beginning of a system to the first note or rest.
<strong>System header with time signature distance</strong>: Sets the distance from a time signature at the beginning of a system to the first note or rest.
<strong>Multimeasure rest margin</strong>:  Sets the distance between a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-rests#multimeasure-rest">multimeasure rest</a> and the barlines on either side.

<strong>Staff line thickness</strong>:  Sets the thickness of the lines of the staff, which allows you to make the staff thicker and darker, if you need greater visibility on your printouts.
<strong>Note</strong>: Changes to an individual measure's <strong>Stretch</strong> (using <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Stretch</samp> → <samp>Increase/Decrease Layout Stretch</samp>) are calculated after, and proportional to, the global  <strong>Spacing</strong> setting.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Page settings</span></h2>
<strong>Page settings</strong> allows you to adjust the <em>overall</em> dimensions of your score such as <a href="#page-size">page size</a>, <a href="#page-margins">page margins</a>, and <a href="#scaling">scaling</a>. 
It is one of the main layout tools in MuseScore—along with the options available from <samp>Format</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style</a></samp>…

To open the <strong>Page settings</strong> dialog: from the menu, select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Page Settings</samp>....
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2017-11/page_settings_0.png?itok=SaCBNB7A">
<h3>Page size</h3>
Here you can select the paper format, either by standard name (e.g., Letter or A4), or by specifying the height and width in either mm or inches (use the radio buttons to choose which unit of measurement to use). 

The initial default page size depends on your localization—in the United States, Letter size paper is standard.
You can also choose to format your music in <strong>Landscape</strong> or <strong>Portrait</strong> orientation using the radio buttons. 
You can optionally use <strong>Two sided</strong> layout (i.e., book format, with mirror left and right margins for even and odd pages—see <a href="#page-margins">below</a>).

<h3>Odd/Even Page Margins</h3>
The <strong>Even Page Margins</strong> and <strong>Odd Page Margins</strong> settings allow you to define the printable area of your pages. 
Aside from changing the margins around the music on the page, other settings, such as the positions of headers and footers, are calculated relative to the margins defined here.

If the "Two sided" checkbox under "Page Size" is selected, you can set margins differently for mirroring odd and even pages. 
Otherwise, only one set of margins can be modified, but will apply to all pages.
To display page margins in your score on screen (though not in print), go to <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Show Page Margins</samp>.

<h3>Scaling</h3>
The <strong>Scaling</strong> property allows you to increase or decrease the size of your score.
In MuseScore, the sizes of score elements, such as note heads, note stems, accidentals, clefs etc., are defined in terms of a unit of measurement called a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">staff space</a>—abbreviated to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp.</a> (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary">Glossary</a>) . 

As you change the "Staff space" setting, <em>all</em> score elements follow suit and thus correct proportions are maintained. 
The exception is <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">Text</a> in which you can set an <em>absolute</em> value, independent of "Scaling."
<strong>Note</strong>: Changing the "Scaling" does not always change the number of systems per page, because system distance can vary between limits set under "Min system distance" and "Max system distance" (see <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp>Page</samp>).

<h3>Unit</h3>
Here you can choose to display the values in Inches or millimeters.
<h3>First page number</h3>
Sets the number of the first page of the particular score. 
Page numbers below 1 won't get printed—e.g., setting the first page number to <em>-1</em> would result in the first and second page showing no page number, and page number 1 appearing on the third page.
<h3>Apply to all Parts</h3>
The <kbd><samp class="button">Apply to all Parts</samp></kbd> button is available when modifying a <strong>part</strong>, rather than the main score (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">Part extraction</a>). 
If you change the page settings of one part and want the rest of the parts to have the same settings, this button will apply the change to all parts in one go.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Breaks and spacers</span></h2>
The <strong>Breaks &amp; Spacers</strong> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> contains the following non-printing symbols:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/MS_breaks_spacers_grey_color.png?itok=uwbSJ40S">




The first three symbols are called <a href="#breaks">breaks</a>; the vertical lines are known as <a href="#spacers">spacers</a>.
<h3>Breaks</h3>
A <strong>break</strong> can be applied to either a measure <em>or</em> a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames">frame</a>. 
There are three types:
<strong>System break</strong>: Forces the next part of the score to start in a new <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#system">system</a>.

<strong>Page break</strong>: Forces the next part of the score to start on a new page.
<strong>Section break</strong>: Forces the next part of the score to start in a new system and starts a new <a href="#section-break">section</a> (see below). 
It can be combined with a page break if required.

<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) Break symbols are visible on the screen, but do not appear on printouts. 
(2) To add (or remove) system breaks over <em>all</em> or <em>part</em> of the score, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#system-breaks">Add/Remove System breaks</a>. 
(3) To split a measure, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#split-join">Measure operations: Split and join</a>.

<h4>Add a break to a measure</h4>
Breaks can be added using either (1) a <em>keyboard shortcut</em>; or (2) a <em>break symbol</em> from a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a>.
<h5>Using a keyboard shortcut</h5>
To add a <strong>System break</strong> or a <strong>Page break</strong> only:
Select any one of the following:
Barline;

Measure;
Notehead;
Text element associated with a staff (e.g. 

lyric syllable, chord symbol, staff text etc.);
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#measure-range">Range of measures</a> (if you choose this option, a break will be applied before and after the selection);
Choose one of the following options:

<strong>System break</strong>: Press<kbd><kbd></kbd></kbd> (toggle).
<strong>Page break</strong>: Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd></kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd></kbd></kbd>) (toggle).


<h5>Using a palette break symbol</h5>
<em>Any</em> break can be added from a workspace <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a>:
Select any one of the following:

Barline;
Measure;
Notehead;

Text element associated with a staff (e.g. 
lyric syllable, chord symbol, staff text etc.);
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#measure-range">Range of measures</a> (if you choose this option, a break will be applied before and after the selection);

Click a break symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4). 
Repeat to toggle off.
Alternatively, <em>drag</em> any break symbol from a palette onto a measure.

<h4>Add a break to a frame</h4>
To add a break to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames">frame</a>, use one of the following options:
Drag a break from a palette onto a frame.

Select a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames">frame</a> then click a palette break symbol (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
<h4>Delete breaks</h4>
Use one of the following options:

Select one or more breaks and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.
See also: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#system-breaks">Add / Remove System breaks</a>.
<h4>Move a break</h4>
Although breaks are not visible on printed output, you can reposition one, if required, by entering <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">edit mode</a> on it and using the keyboard arrow buttons (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-basics#adjust-text-position">Adjust position of text objects</a>).
<h4>Section break</h4>
A <strong>Section break</strong>, as the name suggests, is used to create separate sections within a score. 

Like a <strong>system break</strong>, it forces the next measure or frame to begin a new system, and can also be used in association with a <strong>page break</strong> if required. 
A section break could be used, for example, to divide a piece into separate movements.
Each section can have its own measure numbering independent of the rest of the score. 

By default, the first measure of a section is numbered "1" (see image below), though like the first measure of the score itself, the number is not displayed unless configured in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#properties">measure properties</a> dialog. 
The same dialog can be used to change the numbering according to your preference.
If you change Time signature or Key signature at the beginning of the new section, there will be no courtesy signature at the end of the previous section. 

See example below:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/section_break_0.png?itok=N8oEol4G">

When you play back the score, the program adds a short pause between each section. 

In addition, the first <em>end repeat barline</em> in a section always sends the playback cursor to the beginning of the section, so a <em>start repeat barline</em> is optional.
The following properties can be adjusted in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> after selecting the section break:
<em>Pause</em>: Length of pause, in seconds, at end of the section.

<em>Start new section with  long instrument names</em> (checkbox).
<em>Start new section with measure number one</em> (checkbox).
<em>Start new section with first system indentation</em> (checkbox, as of 3.6).

Prior to version 3.4, the same properties are accessed by right-clicking the break and selecting <samp>Section Break Properties.</samp>
<h3>Spacers</h3>
There are three types of  <strong>spacers</strong>:

<strong>Staff spacer up</strong> (Up-pointing arrow): For adding space <em>above</em> a staff. 
The user sets a minimum height—which may increase (but not decrease) automatically if required by subsequent changes in layout.
<strong>Staff spacer down</strong> (Down-pointing arrow):  For adding space <em>below</em> a staff. 

The user sets a minimum height—which may increase (but not decrease) automatically if required by subsequent changes in layout.
<strong>Staff spacer fixed down</strong> (Capital letter "I"): For adding a <em>fixed</em> space below the staff. 
The height set by the user is <em>always</em> adhered to and overrides any automatic layout settings. 

This spacer can also be used to draw staves closer than autoplacement would normally allow.
<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) Spacers are designed for <em>local</em> adjustments only. 
If you wish to adjust the space between staves across the <em>whole</em> score, use the settings in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-page">Format → Style... 

→ Page</a> instead. 
(2) Spacer symbols are visible on the screen, but do not appear on printouts. 
(3) Spacers cannot be applied to a frame.

<h4>Add a spacer</h4>
Either select a measure, then click a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> spacer symbol (double-click in versions prior to 3.4); or, drag a spacer symbol from a palette onto a measure.
To set the spacer height use one of the following:

Adjust the "Height" property in the <strong>Spacer</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
Select the spacer and use the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> keys and/or  <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> to move the end-handle up and down
Drag the adjustment handle of the spacer.


<h4>Delete a spacer</h4>
Click on the spacer and press the <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> key.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Frames</span></h2>
A <strong>Frame</strong> is a rectangular container for empty space, text or pictures in the score. 
It can be one of three types:

<a href="#horizontal">Horizontal</a>: Used to create a break in a particular system. 
Can contain one or more text objects and/or images.
<a href="#vertical">Vertical</a>: Inserted above a system or appended to the last system. 

Can contain one or more text objects and/or images.
<a href="#text">Text</a>: Inserted above a system or appended to the last system. 
Can contain one text object only.

<h3>Horizontal frame</h3>
A <strong>horizontal frame</strong> is used to create a break in a system. 
For example, you can:

Create a coda, with an adjustable gap separating it from the rest of the score (as in the example below).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/Horizontal_Frame_0.png?itok=gLt4btPe">
Create an offset at the beginning of the score, where there is no staff name to perform the same function.
Create an adjustable right margin at the end of a system.

Create space for some text or image(s).
Create a space between a 'historical incipit' and the beginning of the modern edition.
<h4>Insert/append horizontal frame</h4>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#create-a-frame">Create a Frame</a> (below).
<h4>Adjust width of horizontal frame</h4>
Use one of the following methods:

Click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the frame and drag the handle to the right or left.
Select the frame and adjust "Width" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<h4>Add text or image to horizontal frame</h4>
<strong>To add text</strong>: Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Text</samp>.
<strong>To add an image</strong>: Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Picture</samp>.
<h3>Vertical frame</h3>
A <strong>vertical frame</strong> can be inserted above a system or appended to the last system. 
It can contain one or more text objects and/or images. 
The height is adjustable and the width equals the system width.

It can be used, for example, to:
Create an area at the head of a score for Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist text etc. 
(see <a href="#add-text-image-vf">below</a>).

Create a title page (see <a href="#external-links">below</a>).
Add single- or multi-column lyric text (at the end of a score).
Create subtitles and other annotations between systems.

<h4>Insert/append vertical frame</h4>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#create-a-frame">Create a Frame</a> (below).
<h4>Adjust height of vertical frame</h4>
Use one of the following methods:
Click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the frame and drag the handle up or down.
Select the frame and adjust "Height" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

<h4>Edit vertical frame properties</h4>
Selecting the frame allows you to adjust various parameters in the Inspector:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/inspector_vertical_frame.PNG?itok=hdMVii2q">


<strong>Top Gap</strong>: Adjusts distance between frame and element above.
<strong>Bottom Gap</strong>: Adjusts distance between frame and element below.
<strong>Height</strong>: Adjusts height of the frame.
<strong>Left Margin</strong>: Moves left-aligned text objects to the right.
<strong>Right Margin</strong>: Moves right-aligned text objects to the left.
<strong>Top margin</strong>: Moves top-aligned text objects downwards (see also <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> → <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-page">Page</a>).
<strong>Bottom Margin</strong>: Moves bottom-aligned text objects upwards (see also <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> → <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-page">Page</a>).
<h4>Add text or image to vertical frame</h4>
<strong>To add text</strong>: Right-click on the frame, select <samp>Add</samp>, and choose one of the text options.

<strong>To add an image</strong>: Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Picture</samp>.
You can create as many objects as you like within a frame. 
Their positions can be adjusted independently by dragging or, more accurately, by altering the offset values in the Inspector. 

To format text objects, see  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Text editing</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">Text styles and properties</a>.
<h4>Insert horizontal frame in vertical frame</h4>
Right-click on the frame and select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Insert Horizontal Frame</samp>.

The <a href="#horizontal">horizontal frame</a> is automatically <em>left-aligned</em> and fills the entire vertical frame. 
To <em>right-align</em> it:
Reduce the <a href="#edit-width-hf">width</a> of the horizontal frame.

Deselect the frame then drag it to the right. 
To restore left-alignment, drag the frame to the left.


<h4>"Title" frame</h4>
A vertical frame is automatically created at the beginning of a score, showing the title, subtitle, composer, lyricist etc., when you fill in the information fields provided on page 1 of the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#enter-score-information">New Score Wizard</a>.
If the score does not have a vertical frame at the beginning, you can create one as follows:

From the menu, select <samp>Add</samp> → <samp>Text</samp> → <samp>Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist</samp>;
Type the desired text;
Press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>, or click on an empty space, to exit.

<h3>Text frame</h3>
A <strong>Text frame</strong> looks like a <a href="#vertical">vertical frame</a>, but is specialized for text input: <em>one</em> text object is allowed per frame. 
The height automatically expands to fit the content and there is no height adjustment handle.

A text frame can be used, for example, to:
Create lyric text at the end of a score.
Create subtitles and other annotations between systems.

Create and insert an empty [blank] page anywhere in the score, including at the beginning.
<h4>Insert/ append text frame</h4>
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames#create-a-frame">Create a Frame</a> (below).

<h4>Edit text frame properties</h4>
Selecting the frame allows you to adjust various parameters in the Inspector:
<strong>Top Gap</strong>: Adjusts distance between frame and element above.
<strong>Bottom Gap</strong>: Adjusts distance between frame and element below.
<strong>Height</strong>: Not applicable to text frames.
<strong>Left Margin</strong>: Moves left-aligned text objects to the right.
<strong>Right Margin</strong>: Moves right-aligned text objects to the left.
<strong>Top margin</strong>: Moves top-aligned text objects downwards.
<strong>Bottom Margin</strong>: Moves bottom-aligned text upwards.

<h3>Create a frame</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This document is written for blind and visually impaired users of MuseScore 3. 
It is not intended to provide a full description of all of the features of MuseScore; you should read this in conjunction with the regular MuseScore documentation.
MuseScore comes with support for the free and open source <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA screen reader</a> for Windows. 

You can also <a href="https://github.com/MarcSabatella/Accessibility/releases">install a script</a> to enable support for <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/MarcSabatella/Accessibility/tree/master/MuseScore/Orca">install a script</a> for <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/">Orca</a> on Linux.
Eventually we hope to support other screen readers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceOver">VoiceOver</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798">Narrator</a>. 
Currently, unsupported screen readers will usually read menus and dialogs, but reading the score note by note currently requires one of the supported screen readers.

Beginning with MuseScore 3.3, most of the features of MuseScore are fully accessible, it is viable both as a score reader and editor. 
Previous versions were more limited with respect to editing.
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
When you run MuseScore for the first time, you will be asked some questions on startup. 
We recommend you accept the defaults, but answer "no" to the question about showing tours, since these unfortunately are not yet accessible.
When MuseScore starts, the first thing you normally see is the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#start-center">Start Center</a> window. 

This shows you a list of recent scores that you can access via Shift+Tab and then using the left and right cursor keys. 
You may find it easier to open scores directly from the File menu, however so you can press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to close the Start Center if you prefer. 
In fact you may want to permanently disable it. 

After closing the Start Center, open the Edit menu (<kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></kbd>), choose Preferences, and in the General tab, uncheck Show Start Center, then close the Preferences window.
MuseScore includes keyboard shortcuts for many of its commands, and others that do not have shortcuts defined by default can be customized later, in Edit, Preferences, Shortcuts.
<h3>Finding your way around</h3>
The user interface in MuseScore works much like other notation programs or other document-oriented programs in general. 
It has a single main document window within which you can work with a score. 
MuseScore supports multiple document tabs within this window. 

It also supports a split-screen view to let you work with two documents at once, and you can have multiple tabs in each window.
In addition to the score window, MuseScore has a menu bar that you can access via the shortcuts for the individual menus:
File: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>

Edit: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></kbd>
View: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd></kbd>
Add: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>

Format: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd></kbd>
Tools: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd></kbd>
Plugins: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd>

Help: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd></kbd>
Hint: once you have opened a menu, it may take several presses of the <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> keys before everything is read properly. 
Also, if at any point the screenreader stops responding, a useful trick to kickstart it again is to press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> to move focus to the menu bar, then <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd> to return to the score. 

Sometimes switching to another application then back can help as well.
In addition to the menu bar, there are also a number of toolbars, palettes, and sub-windows within MuseScore, and you can cycle through the controls in these using <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> (or <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> to move backwards through this same cycle). 
When you first start MuseScore, or load a score, focus should be in the main score window.

If nothing is selected (press Esc to clear any selection), pressing Tab takes you to a toolbar containing a series of buttons for operations like New, Open, Play, and so forth. 
Tab will skip any buttons that aren't currently active. 
The names and shortcuts (where applicable) for these buttons should be read by your screen reader.

Once you have cycled through the buttons on the toolbar, the next window Tab will visit is the Palettes. 
This is used to add various elements to a score (dynamics, articulations, and so forth).
If an element is selected in the score, the first window visited by Tab is the Inspector, which is used for making various manual adjustments in your score. 

Many of these features are based on the visual appearance of the score (although a few relate to playback).
If you have opened one of the additional optional windows, such as the Selection Filter, the Tab key will also visit these. 
You can close windows you do not need by going to the View menu and making sure none of the first set of checkboxes is selected (the windows that appear before the Zoom settings). 

By default, only the Palettes and Inspector should be selected. 
See <a href="#setup">Initial Setup</a> for instructions for disabling the Start Center. 
<kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd> can be used to toggle the Palettes while <kbd><kbd>F8</kbd></kbd> will toggle the Inspector.

To return focus to the score window after visiting the toolbar, or a subwindow, press Esc. 
If something was selected before visiting the other window, the selection is left intact, but pressing Esc once focus is in the score window clears the selection. 
The selection is automatically restored when you commence navigation using the accessibility commands described below.

<h3>The score window</h3>
When you first start MuseScore 3 an empty example score is loaded by default. 
If you wish to experiment with editing features, this would be a good place to begin. 

Otherwise, you will probably want to start by loading a score. 
MuseScore uses the standard shortcuts to access system commands like <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd></kbd>) to open a file, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></kbd>) to save, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd></kbd>) to close, etc.
If you press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd></kbd>) to load a score, you are presented with a fairly standard file dialog. 

MuseScore can open scores in its own format (MSCZ or MSCX) as well as import scores in the standard MusicXML format, in MIDI format, or from a few other programs such as Guitar Pro, Capella, and Band-in-a-Box. 
Once you have loaded a score, it is displayed in a new tab within the score window. 
You can move between the tabs in the score window using <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> (does not apply for Mac). 

Hint: if the name of the score in the current tab is not read, ask your screen reader to read the title bar.
To read the score note by note, see below, but there are a few other interesting things you can do with a loaded score. 
You can press Space to have MuseScore play the score for you. 

You can use File / Export to convert to another format, including PDF, PNG, WAV, MP3, MIDI, MusicXML, etc. 
And of course, you can print it via File / Print or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd>).
If a score contains multiple instruments, it may already have linked parts generated. 

Linked parts are presented as part tabs within score tabs, but currently, there is no way to navigate these part tabs using the keyboard. 
The parts would not normally contain information different from the score; they would just be displayed differently (each part on its own page). 
If a score does not already have parts generated, you can do so through File / Parts, and that dialog is accessible. 

If you wish to print the parts, you can work around the inability of accessing part tabs individually by using the File / Export Parts dialog, which automatically exports PDF’s (or other formats) for all parts in one step.
<h3>Score reading</h3>
When you first load a score, the score window has the keyboard focus, but there will be nothing selected. 

The first step to reading a score is to select something, and the most natural place to begin is with the first element of the score. 
After a score is loaded, <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>) will select the literal first element, which is likely the title; <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd></kbd>) will select the first "musical" element (usually a clef or an initial barline).
As you navigate between elements, your screen reader should give the name of the selected element. 

You will hear it read the name of the element (for example, “Treble clef”) and also give position information (for example, “Measure 1; Beat 1; Staff 1; Violin”). 
The amount of information read is optimized to not repeat information that has not changed. 
Pressing Shift currently interrupts the reading, which might also be useful.

Most navigation in MuseScore is centered around notes and rests only—it will skip clefs, key signatures, time signatures, barlines, and other elements. 
So if you just use the standard <kbd><kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Left</kbd></kbd> keys to move through your score, you will only hear about notes and rests (and the elements attached to them). 
However, there are two special accessibility commands that you will find useful to gain a more complete summarization of the score:

Next element: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>)
Previous element: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></kbd>
These commands include clefs and other elements that the other navigation commands skip, and also navigate through all voices within the current staff, whereas other navigation commands such as <kbd><kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Left</kbd></kbd> only navigate through the currently selected voice until you explicitly change voices. 

For instance, if you are on a quarter note on beat 1 of measure 1, and there are two voices in that measure, then pressing Right will move on to the next note of voice 1—which will be on beat 2—whereas pressing <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>) will stay on beat 1 but move to the note on voice 2. 
 Only once you have moved through all notes on the current beat on the current staff will the shortcut move you on to the next beat. 
The intent is that this shortcut should be useful for navigating through a score if you don’t already know what the contents are.

When you navigate to an element, your screen reader should read information about it. 
For notes and rests, it will also read information about elements attached to them, such as lyrics, articulations, chord symbols, etc. 
The accessibility commands will also navigate through those elements individually.

One important note: <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> by themselves, with <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>, or with <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd> are not useful shortcuts for navigation! Instead, they change the pitch of the currently selected note or notes. 
Be careful not to inadvertently edit a score you are trying to read. 
Up and Down should only be used with Alt if your intent is navigation only. 

See the list of navigation shortcuts below.
If you should lose track of your place in the score - or if you lose the selection completely - press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd></kbd> ("location") to get the current location.
<h4>Moving forwards or backwards in time</h4>
The following shortcuts are useful for moving “horizontally” through a score:
Next element: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>
Previous element: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></kbd>

Next chord or rest: <kbd><kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>
Previous chord or rest: <kbd><kbd>Left</kbd></kbd>
Next measure: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>

Previous measure: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></kbd>
Go to measure: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>
First element: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd></kbd>

Last element: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>End</kbd></kbd>
<h4>Moving between notes at a given point in time</h4>
The following shortcuts are useful for moving “vertically” through a score:

Next element: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd>
Previous element: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></kbd>
Next higher note in voice, previous voice, or staff above: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd></kbd>

Next lower note in voice, next voice, or staff below: <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd></kbd>
Top note in chord: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd></kbd>
Bottom note in chord: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd></kbd>

The <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> commands are similar to the <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></kbd> commands in that they are designed to help you discover the content of a score. 
You do not need to know how many notes are in a chord, how many voices are in a staff, or how many staves are in a score in order to move vertically through the score using these commands.
<h4>Filtering score reading</h4>
Excluding certain elements like lyrics, or chord names while reading the score is possible by using the Selection filter (<kbd><kbd>F6</kbd></kbd>). 
Uncheck those elements you don't want to read. 
However, this feature may not currently be implemented.

<h3>Score playback</h3>
The <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> bar serves both to start and stop playback. 
Playback will start with the currently selected note if one is selected; where playback was last stopped if no note is selected; or at the beginning of the score on first playback.

MuseScore supports looped playback so you can repeat a section of a piece for practice purposes. 
To set the “in” and “out” points for the loop playback via the Play Panel (<kbd><kbd>F11</kbd></kbd>):
First select the note in the score window where the loop should start;

Go to the Play Panel and press the Set loop In position toggle button;
Back to the score window, navigate to the note where you want the loop to end;
Switch again to Play Panel, and press the Set loop Out position toggle button;

To enable or disable the loop, press the Loop Playback toggle button.

You can also control the loop playback and control other playback parameters, such as overriding the basic tempo of a score, using the View / Play Panel (<kbd><kbd>F11</kbd></kbd>).

<h3>Score creation and editing</h3>
While some advanced score editing techniques require visual inspection of the score, and a small number of commands may require the mouse, as of MuseScore 3.3 most score editing features are fully accessible.
You can enter music into the default empty score (a score with one staff, using a piano sound), or edit an existing score that you have opened already, or you can create a new score with the set of instruments you want.

<h4>Creating a new score</h4>
To create a new score, use File, New or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd>. 
A wizard then walks you through the score creation process.

The first screen of the wizard has fields to enter the title, composer, and other information. 
The second allows you to select a template (predefined scores for common ensembles like choral SATB or jazz big band) or to select instruments. 
The third allows you to select an initial key signature and tempo. 

Sometimes this screen gets skipped, so if this happens, press the Back button to go back. 
To select a key, use <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd>. 
The key signature control does not work well with some screenreaders, but if you give the "read current line" command (e.g., NVDA+L), it may read the currently-selected key. 

The next and final screen of the wizard allows you to select an initial time signature, pickup (anacrusis), and the number of measures to start with.
Once you have a score, you can begin editing it.
<h4>Note input</h4>
To enter notes, you need to be in note input mode. 
First, navigate to the measure in which you would like to enter notes, then press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>. 
Almost everything about note input is designed to be keyboard accessible, and the standard documentation should be good to help you through the process. 

Bear in mind that MuseScore can either be in note input or normal mode, and it won’t always be clear which mode of these you are in. 
When in doubt, press Esc. 
If you were in note input mode, this will take you out. 

If you were in normal mode, you will stay there, although you will also lose your selection.
The basic process of note input is to first select a duration (for example, using shortcuts 4-5-6 for eighth, quarter, half), then enter a note by typing its letter name. 
Once a duration is selected you can enter multiple notes of the same duration. 

Press <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> to enter a rest.
The <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> keys raise or lower the pitch by a half step, adding or removing accidentals as necessary. 
To change enharmonic spelling of a note, press <kbd><kbd>J</kbd></kbd>.

To enter a tie, select the duration of the tied note then press <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd>. 
To create triplets, select the total duration for the triplet, then press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd> (similarly for quadruplets and other tuplets). 
To enter music in multiple voices on a single staff, pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> plus a number from 1 to 4 will switch to that voice (keep in mind, the first voice for each staff is always voice 1).

There is much more to note input in MuseScore. 
See for the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input">section on Note Input in the Handbook</a>.
<h4>Selection</h4>
MuseScore supports the usual keyboard shortcuts for selection. 
Navigating is the same as selecting for single elements. 
To select a range of elements, navigate to the first, press and hold Shift, then navigate to the second. 

<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd> will select the entire score.
<h4>Palettes</h4>
As mentioned previously, many symbols other than notes are entered from the palettes window. 

The basic use model is, first select the element or elements in the score you want to apply the palette item to, then apply the palette element. 
There are a few different ways to select the palette element.
The simplest method to use at first is to simply browse the palettes window by keyboard. 

To reach the palettes window, press Shift+Tab. 
The screenreader may not specifically tell you that you are in the palettes window, but you will discover that you are as you navigate. 
Depending on whether you have used the palettes before, focus may be where you left off, or at the top. 

Press Tab a few times to get to the first palette within the window (Clefs). 
You can browse the list of palettes using the Up and Down cursor keys. 
The Right cursor key opens a palette, and then all four cursor keys can be used to navigate through the elements (they are arranged in a table). 

You can also use Tab to navigate the palette names and contents.
Once you have found a palette item you want to apply, press Enter to apply it to the currently-selected score elements and return focus to the score. 
The next time you press Shift+Tab to return to the palettes, the last-used palette item will still be selected, so Enter will apply it again. 

 The screenreader may stop responding after applying a palette item, even though focus has returned to the score, but the trick of pressing Alt followed by Esc should get it working again.
You can also use the palette search facility to quickly find a palette item. 
The search box is one of the first elements at the top of the palette, so you can navigate to it, or you can define a shortcut (Edit, Preferences, Shortcuts) for the "Palette search" command, which will subsequently take you directly to the search box. 

 Once you are in the box, type the first few characters of a search term, and only palette items matching that search will shown. 
You can then navigate to the search results and find the element you want. 
The Down cursor will take you directly to the first search result, then you can use Right after that. 

 However, on some systems MuseScore may crash when using the palette search function with a screen reader enabled.
Another way to reach the palettes window is with the <kbd><kbd>F9</kbd></kbd> shortcut, which toggles the palettes window on and off. 
 By default, the palettes window is open, so pressing F9 will close it, but then pressing it again opens the window and puts the cursor in the search box.

There is one other useful technique for palette accessibility, and that is the "Apply current palette element" command (for which you can define a shortcut). 
If you are in the score, this will apply the last-used palette element automatically (the equivalent of Shift+Tab followed by Enter).
<h4>Menus and Shortcuts</h4>
Some elements can be added or edited via menu commands or keyboard shortcuts. 
The Edit menu has standard copy and paste commands (and the usual shortcuts work too). 
The Add menu has commands to add notes, tuplets, measures, frames, text, and some lines. 

The Format menu has commands relating mostly to the visual appearance of the score (e.g., page and staff size, position and size of symbols, fonts used for text), which can be extremely useful in producing large print a.k.a. 
"modified stave notation" scores (see below). 
The Tools menu has a number of other useful commands, including ones to remove measures or other selected ranges, to transpose a selection, to join and split measures, and more. 

any of these commands have shortcuts defined by default that should be read by a screenreader. 
You can define custom shortcuts for most of the rest in Edit, Preferences, Shortcuts.
There are also shortcuts for a number of palette items, and the possibility to define others (although many palette items currently do not support this). 

Some useful shortcuts to remember include:
Ctrl+T: staff text

Alt+Shift+T: tempo


Ctrl+L: lyrics

Ctrl+K: chord symbol

Ctrl+M: rehearsal mark

S: slur

Shift+S: staccato

Shift+V: accent


Shift+N: tenuto

Shift+O: marcato

slash: grace note


less than: crescendo

greater than: diminuendo
<h3>Customization</h3>
You can customize the keyboard shortcuts by opening the Edit menu, selecting Preferences, then navigating to the Shortcuts tab. 
Once there, Tab will take you to the list of shortcuts, and you can navigate the list directly with the Up and Down cursor keys, but it is a very long list. 
You can instead hit Tab a few more times to reach the Search box, then type the first few characters of the command to filter the list, then navigate back to the list.

Once you have found the command you wish to customize, press Enter. 
You can then press the key combination you wish to be the shortcut. 
It can be a single key, a key with Shift, Ctrl, and/or other modifiers, or even a sequence or two or more keys pressed in succession. 

After entering the shortcut you wish, press Tab to get to the Add or Replace button (Tab is the only key that won't be interpreted as part of a shortcut sequence). 
If you reach Cancel without ever seeing Add or Replace, it means the shortcut you choose conflicts with another. 
Navigate back to the where you typed the shortcut and it will tell you the name of the command it conflicts with. 

Hit Tab to get to the Clear button to clear it, then try again with a different shortcut.
At some point, we may provide a set of special accessibility-optimized shortcuts. 
There is already a facility in the shortcut dialog to save and load shortcut definitions, so it is possible to share shortcut definitions with other users.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Albums</span></h2>
<strong>The Album feature has been disabled for 3.x. 
It will come back in 4.0.</strong>

The Album Manager allows you to prepare a list of multiple scores and save the list as an album file ("*.album"), print all the scores as one long print job with consistent page numbers, or even join the scores into a single new MSCZ score. 
This is ideal for preparing an exercise book or combining multiple movements of an orchestration.
To open the Album Manager, go to <kbd><samp>File</samp> → <samp>Album...</samp></kbd>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Album_en.png?itok=CZW4TDVT">
<h3>Create album</h3>
To create a new album, click the <kbd><samp class="button">New</samp></kbd> button. 
Fill in a title in the "Album Name:" box at the top.

To add scores to the album, click <kbd><samp class="button">Add Score</samp></kbd>. 
A file selection dialog will appear and let you choose one or multiple scores from your file system. 
Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd>.

The scores you add will appear in a list in the Album Manager. 
You can rearrange their order by selecting a score and clicking the <kbd><samp class="button">Up</samp></kbd> or <kbd><samp class="button">Down</samp></kbd> button.
<h3>Load album</h3>
If you have previously created an album, you can open it through the Album Manager by clicking the <kbd><samp class="button">Load</samp></kbd> button. 
A file selection dialog will appear to let you load the .album file from your file system.
<h3>Print album</h3>
To print an album as if it were a single document, click <kbd><samp class="button">Print Album</samp></kbd>. 
The scores loaded into the Album Manager are printed in the order they are listed in with the correct page numbers, ignoring the page number offset values in <kbd><samp>Layout</samp> → <samp>Page Settings...</samp></kbd> → <samp>First page number</samp> for all but the first score. 
As the album is printed in one print job, double-sided printing (duplex printing) also works as expected.

<h3>Join scores</h3>
To combine multiple scores into a single .mscz file, click <kbd><samp class="button">Join Scores</samp></kbd>. 
The scores are combined in the selected order into one single score. 

If not already present, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers">line-</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section breaks</a> are added to the last measure or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/frames">frame</a> of each score in the combined file.

All style settings are taken from the first score, different style settings from subsequent score are ignored.
All the scores should have the same number of parts and staves for this to work correctly, ideally with the same instruments in the same order. 

If the scores have the same total <em>number</em> of instruments but not the same ones, or not in the same order, then the instrument names from the first score will overwrite ones from subsequent scores. 
If some of the scores have fewer instruments than the first score, then empty staves will be created for those sections. 
<strong>Any part or staff that is not present in the first score will be lost in the joined score.</strong>

<h3>Save album</h3>
Upon clicking the <kbd><samp class="button">Close</samp></kbd> button, you will be prompted to save your album as a .album file. 
This file is not the same as a <a href="#join">joined score</a>; it simply consists of the list of scores. 

Album files can be loaded into the Album Manager as described <a href="#load">above</a>.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Automatic placement</span></h2>

MuseScore's <strong>automatic placement</strong> (AP) feature ensures that, in most cases, elements are correctly spaced and do not collide or overlap with each other.
<em>Note</em>: When you create an element, AP is automatically enabled, but can be turned off if required (see <a href="#disable-automatic-placement">Disable automatic placement</a>).
<h3>Default position</h3>
A newly-created element, such as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-and-system-text">staff text</a> or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/fingering">fingering</a>, assumes a default position on the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#staff">staff</a> specified by "positional" properties contained in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style</a> menu. 
These "positional" properties may include things such as:
<strong>Placement</strong>: Whether the element appears above or below the staff.

<strong>Offset</strong>: For elements with no "Placement above/below" properties, this specifies the default position. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">Offset X/Y</a>.
<strong>Autoplace min distance</strong>: Minimum distance from other elements when autoplace is enabled.

For details of the settings available for each element type, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Layout and formatting: Style</a>.
<h4>Change the default placement of an element</h4>
Use one of the following methods:

From the menu, select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style</samp>; choose an element type and then adjust the placement/position settings.
Select a relevant element in the score and change the placement/position settings in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>; then press the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#set-reset-buttons">Set as style</a>" button (<kbd><samp class="button">S</samp></kbd>) to update the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style</a> settings.
<h3>Manual adjustments</h3>
<h4>Adjust position of element</h4>
Use one of the following methods:
<strong>Select the element and adjust the X and Y offsets in the Inspector</strong> (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#element">X and Y offsets</a>).

<strong>Move the element using the arrow buttons</strong>. 
Change to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">edit mode</a> first, if necessary.
<strong>Drag and drop the element using the mouse</strong>. 

Use this method in preference to the above, if you want to <em>move an element across another one</em> (e.g. 
fingering across a slur). 
Once located on the other side you can use the X/Y offsets in the Inspector, or the keyboard arrow keys to fine tune the position.

<h4>Place element above/below staff</h4>
Elements with a "Placement" property available in the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> can be easily moved from <em>above</em> the staff to <em>below</em> it, and vice versa:
Select one or more elements.

Use one of the following methods:
Change the "Placement" setting in the Inspector.
Press <kbd><samp>X</samp></kbd> to toggle between above/below.

<strong>Note</strong>: When automatic placement is enabled for an element, you cannot position it in a way that causes a collision with other elements.
<h3>Disable automatic placement</h3>
Select the element and uncheck the "Automatic placement" box in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

The element reverts to its default position. 
It can be repositioned as desired and is no longer avoided when placing other elements.
<h3>Stacking order</h3>
To change the value for <strong>Stacking order</strong>:
Select the element and change the  "Stacking order" value in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
In cases where elements are allowed to overlap, <strong>Stacking order</strong> controls the order in which they are placed on top of each other. 

The element with the lower value will be placed behind.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Cross-staff notation</span></h2>

In piano scores, it is common to write a musical phrase extending across both staves—bass and treble. 
This can be entered in MuseScore as follows:
Enter the notation in one staff to begin with. 

e.g.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-11/crossbeams1.png?itok=27tFCF6M">

Select a note and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + ↓/↑ (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + ↓/↑). 

This moves all the notes in that <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a> down/up to the other staff. 
e.g.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2017-11/crossbeams1a.png?itok=s8Sv4ExY">
<em>Note</em>: If you only want to move certain notes in a chord you need to ensure that they are in a separate voice.

To adjust the beam, double-click it to show the handles. 
Use the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode#keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard arrows</a> or drag the handles to change the beam angle and height:

<h2><br><span class="orange">Early music features</span></h2>
MuseScore offers several specialized functions to create engravings of early music (particularly medieval and renaissance) akin to commercial editions from the 20th century onwards.
<h3>Unbarred (or unmetered) notation</h3>
In MuseScore, notes lasting longer than the duration of a measure are normally tied across barlines. 
However MuseScore has a special feature which allows it to display the note values intact, without splitting and tying them in this way. 
This enables you to notate music which is unbarred (i.e. 

not divided into measures), such as that of the <strong>renaissance</strong>:
From the menu bar, select  <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style...</samp>→<samp>Score</samp>.
Tick the box labelled "Display note values across measure boundaries … ."

Click "OK" or "Apply." The existing score is immediately updated.
<h4>Example</h4>
The example below shows an excerpt from the original score of "De Profundis Clamavi" for 4 voices by Nicolas Champion:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/EarlyMusicTut-Original.png?itok=Vma0GKzc">

And after activating "Display note values across measure boundaries … ."

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-01/EarlyMusicTut-Unbarred.png?itok=KAJuZDcz">

To get rid of the barlines, just untick the “Show barlines” box in the Staff / Part properties dialog. 

See also <a href="#mensurstrich">Mensurstrich</a> (below).

<strong>Note</strong>: The feature is still in development and may contain bugs. 

The longest supported note value is the longa (a dotted longa is still broken up and tied over).
<h3>Mensurstrich</h3>
Since a complete lack of barlines could make performing the music more difficult for current musicians, many modern engravers settled on a compromise called <em>Mensurstrich</em>, where barlines are drawn between, but not across, staves.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/EarlyMusicTut-Mensurstrich.png?itok=88ip4aA0">
To place barlines between staves:
In the lowest staff (usually the bottom staff of a system) where the proposed <em>Mensurstriche</em> is required, uncheck "Show barlines" in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff/Part Properties</a> dialog;
In the staff above where you want the <em>Mensurstriche</em>, click on one barline;

In the <strong>Barline</strong> section of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>, tick the "Span to next staff" option;
In the <strong>Barline</strong> section of the Inspector, adjust the "Span from" value so that the top of the barline meets the bottom line of the staff (e.g., set to 8);
Click the "Set as staff default" button.


<h3>Ambitus</h3>
Before there was the concept of an absolute pitch, performers were required to transpose vocal music to a singable range for their ensemble "on the fly." To aid them, an <strong>ambitus</strong> was sometimes included, marking the entire range of a voice at the beginning of the piece.

To apply an ambitus, use one of the following methods:
Drag the ambitus symbol (from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">Lines</a> palette of the Advanced workspace) onto a clef.
Select one or more clefs, then click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the ambitus symbol (in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/lines">Lines</a> palette of the Advanced workspace).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/EarlyMusicTut-Ambitus_en.png?itok=PXIqpCJ_">

When applied, the ambitus automatically displays the note range of the score: if there is a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers#section-break">section break</a> then <em>only</em> the note range of the section is displayed. 
Beyond the section break a new ambitus may be applied.

The note range of the ambitus can be adjusted manually by selecting it and changing the "Top note" and "Bottom note" values in the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
For automatic adjustment click the <kbd><samp class="button">Update Range</samp></kbd> button in the inspector.
<h3>Mensural time signatures</h3>
In the mensural notation system, time signatures did not define the length of a measure, but the length of breves and semibreves. 
MuseScore supports mensural time symbols as a display method in the Time signature properties dialog rather than as symbols, but they are just for show, as the proportion of e.g. 
half notes per whole notes cannot be modified.

One way to make use of these symbols is to replicate when composers of the renaissance had multiple voices in different time signatures simultaneously without using tuplets. 
Edit the time signature on a per-staff basis, as long as the beginning and end of a measure in all staves match up. 
If they do not, then consider increasing the size of the measures to the lowest common denominator.

<h3>Period tablature</h3>
Authentic-looking period tablature is possible for instruments such as the lute, theorbo etc. 
The various historical styles are well supported by a choice of fretmark and note symbol fonts, optional “upside-down” tablature, and special symbols for bass-string notes. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tablature">Tablature</a>.

<h3>Adding a new figured bass indication</h3>
Select the note to which the figured bass applies;

Press the <strong>Figured Bass</strong> shortcut. 
The default is<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd></kbd>): this can be changed in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#shortcuts">Prefences: Shortcuts</a> if desired;
Enter the text in the editor 'blue box' as required (see below);

Use one of the following options as required:
Press <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to move to the next note ready for another figured bass indication (or click outside the editor box to exit it). 
The editor advances to the next note, or to the rest of the staff to which figured bass is being added. 

(To move to a point in between, or to extend a figured bass group for a longer duration, see <a href="#duration">Duration</a> (below)).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/trunk_fb_sample_1_1.png?itok=io9DCQms">

<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> moves the editing box to the previous staff note or rest.

<kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> advances the editing box to the beginning of the next measure.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> moves the editing box to the beginning of the previous measure.


<h3>Text format</h3>
<h4>Digits</h4>
Digits are entered directly. 

Groups of several digits stacked one above the other are also entered directly in a single text, stacking them with <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_sample_2_0.png?itok=ggu-Axx8">
<h4>Accidentals</h4>
Accidentals can be entered using regular keys:

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th><em>To enter:</em></th>

<th><em>type:</em></th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>double flat</td>
<td>bb</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>flat</td>

<td>b</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>natural</td>
<td>h</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>sharp</td>
<td>#</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>double sharp</td>

<td>##</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

</table>
These characters will automatically turn into the proper signs when you leave the editor. 
Accidentals can be entered before, or after a digit (and of course, in place of a digit, for altered thirds), according to the required style; both styles are properly aligned, with the accidental 'hanging' at the left, or the right.

<h4>Combined shapes</h4>
Slashed digits or digits with a cross can be entered by adding <kbd><kbd>\</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>/</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd> after the digit (combining suffixes); the proper combined shape will be substituted when leaving the editor:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/trunk_fb_sample_3_0.png?itok=2U-kjsrx">


The built-in font can manage combination equivalence, favoring the more common substitution:
1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ result in 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_modern_1.png?itok=UIUPEjBA">


(or 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_historic_1.png?itok=hYz8aRe3">

)

and 5\, 6\, 7\, 8\, 9\ result in 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_modern_2.png?itok=uUSHgZJo">
(or 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_digits_historic_2.png?itok=JAwLWcCl">


)
Please remember that <kbd><kbd>/</kbd></kbd> can only by combined with <kbd><kbd>5</kbd></kbd>; any other 'slashed' figure is rendered with a question mark.
<kbd><kbd>+</kbd></kbd> can also be used before a digit; in this case it is not combined, but it is properly aligned ('+' hanging at the left side).

<h4>Parentheses</h4>
Open and closed parentheses, both round: '(', ')' and square: '[', ']', can be inserted before and after accidentals, before and after a digit, before and after a continuation line; added parentheses will not disturb the proper alignment of the main character.
<em>Notes</em>: (1) The editor does not check that parentheses, open and closed, round or square, are properly balanced. 

(2) Several parentheses in a row are non-syntactical and prevent proper recognition of the entered text. 
(3) A parenthesis between a digit and a combining suffix ('+', '\', '/') is accepted, but prevents shape combination.
<h4>Continuation lines</h4>
Continuation lines are input by adding an '_' (underscore) at the end of the line. 
Each digit of a group can have its own continuation line:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/trunk_fb_sample_4_0.png?itok=PTKoUYwy">


Continuation lines are drawn for the whole duration of the figured bass group.
<strong>'Extended' continuation lines</strong>
Occasionally, a continuation line has to connect with the continuation line of a following group, when a chord degree has to be kept across two groups. 

Examples (both from J. 
Boismortier, <em>Pièces de viole</em>, op. 
31, Paris 1730):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_sample_4_b_0.png?itok=S7BoslVc">
In the first case, each group has its own continuation line; in the second, the continuation line of the first group is carried 'into' the second.
This can be obtained by entering several (two or more) underscores "__" at the end of the text line of the first group.
<h4>Duration</h4>
Each figured bass group has a duration, which is indicated by a light gray line above it (of course, this line is for information only and it is not printed or exported to PDF).
Initially, a group has the same duration of the note to which it is attached. 
A different duration may be required to fit several groups under a single note or to extend a group to span several notes.

To achieve this, each key combination in the table below can be used to (1) advance the editing box by the indicated duration, and (2) set the duration of the previous group up to the new editing box position.
Pressing several of them in sequence without entering any figured bass text repeatedly extends the previous group.

(The digits are the same as are used to set the note durations)
Setting the exact figured bass group duration is only mandatory in two cases:
When several groups are fit under a single staff note (there is no other way).

When continuation lines are used, as line length depends on the group duration.
However, it is a good practice to always set the duration to the intended value for the purposes of plugins and MusicXML.
<h3>Editing existing figured basses</h3>
To edit a figured bass indication already entered use one of the following options:
Select it, or the note it belongs to and press the same <em>Figured Bass</em> shortcut used to create a new one.
Double-click it.

The usual text editor box will open with the text converted back to plain characters ('b', '#' and 'h' for accidentals, separate combining suffixes, underscores, etc.) for simpler editing.
Once done, press <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to move to a next note, or click outside the editor box to exit it, as for newly created figured basses.
<h3>Style</h3>
To configure how figured bass is rendered: from the menu, select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style…</samp> → <samp>Figured Bass</samp>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/format_style_figured_bass_en_.png?itok=3f2wYjE4">

<strong>Font</strong>: The dropdown list contains all the fonts which have been configured for figured bass. 

A standard installation contains only one font, "MuseScore Figured Bass," which is also the default font.
<strong>Size</strong>: Select a font-size in points. 
<em>Note</em>: This value is also modified by any change made to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#scaling">Scaling</a> (<samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Page Settings</samp>…), or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Scale</a> ("Staff properties").

<strong>Vertical Position</strong>: The distance (in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">spaces</a>) from the top of the staff to the top margin of the figured bass text. 
Negative values go up (figured bass above the staff) and positive values go down (figured bass below the staff: a value greater than 4 is needed to step over the staff itself).
<strong>Line Height</strong>: The distance between the base line of each figured bass line, as a percentage of font size.

The following picture visualizes each numeric parameter:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_param_0.png?itok=E5GCq2uC">
<strong>Alignment</strong>: Select the vertical alignment: with <em>Top</em>, the top line of each group is aligned with the main vertical position and the group 'hangs' from it (this is normally used with figured bass notation and is the default); with <em>Bottom</em>, the bottom line is aligned with the main vertical position and the group 'sits' on it (this is sometimes used in some kinds of harmonic analysis notations):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_vertalign.png?itok=ntIGzdlK">
<strong>Style</strong>: Choose between "Modern" or "Historic." The difference between the two styles is shown below:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/trunk_fb_sample_5.png?itok=fz9uiKPA">

<h3>Proper syntax</h3>
For the relevant substitutions and shape combinations to take effect and for proper alignment, the figured bass mechanism expects input texts to follow some rules (which are in any case, the rules for a syntactical figured bass indication):

There can be only one accidental (before or after), or only one combining suffix per figure;
There cannot be both an accidental <strong>and</strong> a combining suffix;
There can be an accidental without a digit (altered third), but not a combining suffix without a digit.

Any other character not listed above is not expected.
If a text entered does not follow these rules, it will not be processed: it will be stored and displayed as it is, without any layout.

<h2><br><span class="orange">File formats</span></h2>
MuseScore can import and export a wide variety of file formats, allowing you to share and publish scores in the format that best meets your needs.

<h3>MuseScore native format</h3>
MuseScore <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#save">saves</a> files in the following native formats:
<a href="#mscz">*.mscz</a>: The default MuseScore file format. 

Being compressed it takes up relatively little disk space.
<a href="#mscx">*.mscx</a>: An uncompressed MuseScore file format, mainly used for debugging or storing in a versioning system
<a href="#msczcomma">.*.mscz,</a> / <a href="#msczcomma">.*.mscx,</a>: These are backup files. 

Notice the point (full stop) added before the file name, and the comma added to the file extension.
<strong>A note about fonts</strong>: <em>MuseScore does not embed text fonts in saved or exported native format files. 
If you want your MuseScore file to be viewed by other MuseScore users, make sure you are using the built-in Edwin (since version 3.6), FreeSerif, or FreeSans font families for your text, or a font that the other parties have installed too. 

If a system does not have the fonts specified in your original file, MuseScore will use a fallback option, which may cause your score to appear differently.</em>
<h4>MuseScore format (<code>*.mscz</code>)</h4>
MSCZ is the standard MuseScore file format and recommended for most uses. 

A score saved in this format takes up very little disk space, but preserves all the necessary information. 
The format is a ZIP-compressed version of <code>.mscx</code> files and includes any images the score may contain and a thumbnail.
<h4>Uncompressed MuseScore format (<code>*.mscx</code>)</h4>
MSCX is the uncompressed version of the MuseScore file format. 
A score saved in this format will retain all information, except images. 
It can be opened with a text editor, allowing the user access to the file's source code.

<h4>MuseScore backup file (<code>.*.mscz,</code>) or (<code>.*.mscx,</code>)</h4>
Backup files are created automatically and saved in the same folder as your normal MuseScore file. 
The backup copy contains the previously saved version of the MuseScore file and can be important if your normal copy becomes corrupted, or for looking at an older version of the score.

The backup file adds a period to the beginning of the file name (<code>.</code>) and a comma (<code>,</code>) to the end (e.g. 
if your normal file is called "<code>untitled.mscz</code>", the backup copy will be "<code>.untitled.mscz,</code>"), and the period and comma need to be removed from the name in order to open the backup file in MuseScore. 
As it is stored in the same folder as your normal MuseScore file, you may also need to give it a unique name (e.g. 

changing "<code>.untitled.mscz,</code>" to "<code>untitled-backup1.mscz</code>").
<strong>Note:</strong> In order to see the MuseScore backup files, you may need to change your system settings to "Show hidden files". 
See also <a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/52116">How to recover a backup copy of a score</a>.

<h3>Graphic files (export only)</h3>
MuseScore can <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#export">export</a> a score as a graphic file in either <a href="#pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="#png">PNG</a> or <a href="#svg">SVG</a> format.
<h4>PDF (<code>*.pdf</code>)</h4>
<strong>PDF</strong> (Portable Document Format) files are ideal for sharing your sheet music with others who do not need to edit the content. 
This is a very widely-used format and most users will have a PDF viewer of some kind on their computers.
To set the resolution of exported PDFs:

From the menu bar, choose <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>), and select the "Export" tab;
Set the resolution in the "PDF" section.


<h4>PNG (<code>*.png</code>)</h4>
<strong>PNG</strong> (Portable Network Graphics) files are based on a bitmap image format, widely supported by software on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and very  popular on the web. 
MuseScore creates PNG images as they would appear if printed, one image per page.

To set the resolution of exported PNG images:
From the menu bar, choose <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>), and select the "Export" tab;
Set the resolution and transparency in the PNG/SVG section.

<strong>Note:</strong> If you want to create images that show only parts of the score (with or without screen-only items such as frame boxes, invisible notes, and out-of-range note colors), use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/image-capture">Image capture</a> instead.
<h4>SVG (<code>*.svg</code>)</h4>
<a href="http://w3.org/Graphics/SVG">SVG</a> (Scalable Vector Graphics) files can be opened by most web browsers (except Internet Explorer before version 9) and most vector graphics software. 

However, most SVG software does not support embedded fonts, so the appropriate MuseScore fonts must be installed to view these files correctly. 
SVG is the current format for all scores  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/share-scores-online">saved</a> on MuseScore.com.
To set resolution and transparency of exported SVG files, see the instructions under <a href="#png">PNG (above)</a>. 

Note that MuseScore does not (yet) support gradients on export (although it does for <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/images">images</a> in a score).
<h3>Audio files (export only)</h3>
MuseScore can create <em>normalized</em>, stereo audio of the score in any of the following formats: <a href="#wav">WAV</a>, <a href="#mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="#ogg">OGG VORBIS</a>, <a href="#flac">FLAC</a>. 

To export an audio file:
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp> → <samp>Export...</samp>;
Choose the desired format from the dropdown menu, then press <kbd><kbd>Save</kbd></kbd>.


You can adjust the <strong>sample rate</strong> of all audio formats as follows:
From the menu bar, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>), and click on the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences#export">Export</a> tab;

Set "Sample rate" in the "Audio" section.

<h4>WAV audio (<code>*.wav</code>)</h4>
WAV (Waveform Audio Format) is an <em>uncompressed</em> sound format. 
This was developed by Microsoft and IBM, and is widely supported by software for Windows, OS X, and Linux. 
It is an ideal format for use when creating CDs, as full sound quality is preserved. 

For sharing via email or the internet, use a compressed alternative such as <a href="#mp3">MP3</a>.
<h4>MP3 (<code>*.mp3</code>)</h4>
<strong>MP3</strong> is a very widely-used compressed audio format. 

MP3 files are ideal for sharing and downloading over the internet due to their relatively small size.
<strong>To set the MP3 bitrate</strong>:
From the menu bar, choose <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>), and select the "Export" tab;

Set the MP3 bitrate in the "Audio" section.

<h4>FLAC audio (<code>*.flac</code>)</h4>
<a href="http://xiph.org/flac">Free Lossless Audio Codec</a> (FLAC) is compressed audio format. 
FLAC files are approximately half the size of uncompressed audio and just as good quality. 
Windows and OS X do not have built-in support for FLAC, but software such as the free and open source <a href="http://videolan.org/vlc">VLC media player</a> can play FLAC files on any operating system.

<h4>Ogg Vorbis (<code>*.ogg</code>)</h4>
<a href="http://vorbis.com">Ogg Vorbis</a> is intended as a patent-free replacement for the popular MP3 audio format (which MuseScore also supports—see above). 
Like MP3, Ogg Vorbis files are relatively small (often a tenth of uncompressed audio), but some sound quality is lost. 

Windows and OS X do not have built-in support for Ogg Vorbis. 
However, software such as <a href="http://videolan.org/vlc">VLC media player</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> can play Ogg files on any operating system.
<h3>Share with other music software</h3>
MuseScore can <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#open-file">import</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#export">export</a> <a href="#musicxml">MusicXML</a> and <a href="#midi">MIDI</a> files; it is also able to import a variety of native format files from other music notation programs.
<h4>MusicXML (<code>*.musicxml</code>, <code>*.xml</code>)</h4>
<a href="http://musicxml.com">MusicXML</a> is the universal standard for sheet music. 

It is the recommended format for sharing sheet music between different scorewriters, including MuseScore, Sibelius, Finale, and more than 100 others. 
MuseScore imports <code>*.xml</code> and <code>*.musicxml</code>, exports <code>*.musicxml</code>, and the outdated <code>*.xml</code>(since version 3.5) because the program you want to import it needs that, in previous MuseScore version you need to rename it yourself after the export.
<h4>Compressed MusicXML (<code>*.mxl</code>)</h4>
Compressed MusicXML creates smaller files than regular MusicXML. 
This is a newer standard and isn't as widely supported by older scorewriters, but MuseScore has full import and export support.
<h4>MIDI (<code>*.mid</code>, <code>*.midi</code>, <code>*.kar</code>)</h4>
<strong>MIDI</strong> (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a format widely supported by sequencers and music notation software. 
For details of the protocol see the <a href="https://midi.org">MIDI Association</a> website.
MIDI files are very useful for playback purposes but contain little in the way of score layout information (formatting, pitch spelling, voicing, ornaments, articulations, repeats, key signatures etc.). 

To share files between <em>different</em> music notation software, <a href="#musicxml">MusicXML</a> is recommended instead.
For details about how to import MIDI files see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/midi-import">MIDI import</a>.
<h4>MuseData (<code>*.md</code>) (import only)</h4>
<a href="http://musedata.org">MuseData</a> is a format developed by Walter B. 
Hewlett beginning in 1983 as an early means of sharing music notation between software. 
It has since been eclipsed by MusicXML, but several thousand scores in this format are still available online.

<h4>Capella (<code>*.cap</code>, <code>*.capx</code>) (import only)</h4>
CAP and CAPX files are created by the score writer, <a href="http://capella-software.com">Capella</a>. 
MuseScore imports version 2000 (3.0) or later fairly accurately.

<h4>Bagpipe Music Writer (<code>*.bww</code>) (import only)</h4>
BWW files are created by the niche score writer, <a href="http://robertmacneilmusicworks.com">Bagpipe Music Writer</a>.
<h4>BB (<code>*.mgu</code>, <code>*.sgu</code>) (import only)</h4>
BB files are created by the music arranging software, <a href="http://pgmusic.com">Band-in-a-Box</a>. 
MuseScore's support is currently experimental.
<h4>Overture (<code>*.ove</code>) (import only)</h4>
OVE files are created by the score writer <a href="https://sonicscores.com/overture/">Overture</a>. 
This format is mainly popular in Chinese-language environments, such as Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. 
MuseScore's support is currently experimental and seems to support Overture 3 and later only.

<h4>Guitar Pro (various—import only)</h4>
MuseScore can open <a href="http://guitar-pro.com">Guitar Pro</a> files with the following extensions: *.gtp, *.gp3, *.gp4, *.gp5, *.gpx, and, as of version 3.5, *.gp.
<h4>Power Tab Editor (<code>*.ptb</code>) (import only)</h4>
PTB files are created by <a href="http://www.power-tab.net/">Power Tab Editor</a>. 
MuseScore's support is currently experimental.

<h3>Fretboard Diagrams overview</h3>
MuseScore allows the use and creation of <strong>fretboard</strong> (or <strong>chord</strong>) <strong>diagrams</strong>. 
They usually appear above the staff on lead sheets and piano scores. 
They are commonly used for guitar chords, but MuseScore permits the creation of diagrams for any instrument.

Below is a simple example of Fretboard Diagrams use.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20song%20375x242.jpg?itok=hPAiHygm">

(Note: Fretboard Diagrams are an alternative to and quite different from <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tablature">Tablature</a>, which is a specialized notation form that is preferred by some string instrument players.)

The Fretboard Diagram mechanism can be used in several different ways.
<strong>Standard chords</strong>. 
A set of 21 common chord diagrams for the guitar are found in the Fretboard Diagrams <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in the Advanced Workspace. 

These consist of a single example of a major, minor, and seventh chord for each diatonic scale tone (CDEFGAB). 
These 21 chords are adequate for many simple pop or folk music scores. 
See the <a href="#overview-of-standard-chords">overview of this palette</a> below.

<strong>Modified chords</strong>. 
In many cases, the standard chords from the Fretboard Diagrams palette are used as a starting point for creating modified chord diagrams, via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
This technique enables chord extensions, alterations, different voicings, different positions, etc. 

to be applied to the 21 standard diagrams. 
There are literally thousands of guitar chords in general use, making a comprehensive palette or dictionary impractical. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/289836">How to use Fretboard Diagrams for custom/complex chords</a> for examples.

<strong>"Freehand" chords</strong>. 
More advanced guitarists often prefer to start from a blank chord grid, and then draw the specific chord tones desired. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/289836">How to use Fretboard Diagrams for custom/complex chords</a> for examples.


<em>Note</em>: Many aspects of music notation follow well-established engraving standards. 
Guitar chord diagrams are an exception. 

Usage has varied widely from year to year, from publisher to publisher, from teacher to teacher, and from arranger to arranger. 
Many inconsistent practices persist today, and distinct styles of chord notation are preferred in different musical genres and regions. 
For this reason, the MuseScore Fretboard Diagram interface supports diagrams of various types. 

Users are free to choose their preferences.
<h3>Overview of the standard guitar chord palette</h3>
The Fretboard Diagrams <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a> in the Advanced Workspace provides 21 diagrams, comprising a single major, minor, and seventh chord for each diatonic scale tone (CDEFGAB). 

The name of each diagram appears when the cursor hovers over the entry.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20palette%20450x236.jpg?itok=cLA-khv7">

<em>Note</em>: This range of chord diagrams, or indeed any selection of 21 chords, would not typically be sufficient for publication purposes. 

Arrangers must consider many other voicings, positions, and chord qualities. 
This palette is also an example of the diverse diagram formats in use, as discussed above. 
These 21 chords happen to incorporate <strong>open/mute string indicators</strong> (the X and O symbols above the diagrams). 

Although those symbols <em>do</em> often appear in published scores, their usage varies by context. 
For example, jazz arrangements generally omit mute string indicators, unless contextually important, and rarely use open strings.
Additional palettes that contain a broader range of standard chords are expected be available in the future. 

These would try to address the needs of specific musical genres and situations.
<h3>Overview of creating modified or custom chords</h3>
Modified Fretboard Diagrams are created by <a href="#add-fretboard-diagram">adding</a> and then <a href="#edit-fretboard-diagram">editing</a> an existing diagram from the palette. 

By modifying standard chords, it is possible to create Fretboard Diagrams for <em>any</em> playable chord, and to reflect fingering on <em>any</em> Western fretted stringed instrument, regardless of tuning, number of strings, or number of frets. 
Most of the material below deals with the process of modifying diagrams and creating new ones.
Custom diagrams can be saved to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">custom palette</a> if desired for future use. 

Modified diagrams can of course be copied/pasted within a score in the usual ways.
<h3>To add a Fretboard Diagram</h3>
To add a Fretboard Diagram to the score, use one of the following methods:

Select a note in voice 1 and double-click a Fretboard Diagram from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a>.
Drag and drop a Fretboard Diagram from a palette to the desired position in the score.
As the cursor hovers over the chosen diagram within the palette, its name will appear as a <strong>pop-up hint</strong> (see the example in the <a href="#overview-of-standard-chords">overview</a>).

<h4>Chord Symbols linked to Fretboard Diagrams</h4>
When adding a Fretboard Diagram to a score, a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols">chord symbol</a> is also automatically created. 
The chord symbol is normally placed above the diagram, and uses the chord name from the chord's palette cell. 

Automatic placement and formatting of a diagram's chord symbol is controlled by style settings (see <a href="#fretboard-diagram-style">style settings</a>, below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20insertion%2058x175.jpg?itok=N8vhwTJp">
A Fretboard Diagram's generated chord symbol can be selected, moved, and modified like any other text element. 
It behaves generally like the normal <strong>chord symbols</strong> that are added using <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols">Chord Symbol</a></samp> or the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20chord%20symbol%20262x372.jpg?itok=UH8-e21L">

<em>Note 1</em>: A field on the <strong>Chord Symbols</strong> style page (<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style</a> submenu: select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-chord-symbols">Chord symbols</a></samp>) – rather than on the <strong>Fretboard Diagrams</strong> style page – controls the chord symbol's "<strong>Distance to Fretboard Diagram</strong>". 
This value interacts with the Element "<strong>Minimum distance</strong>" field, within the Inspector,  to control automatic placement of the chord symbol relative to the diagram. 

Note also that the Fretboard Diagram's "top edge" includes the blank space where <strong>open/mute string indicators</strong> would appear, even if that area is empty. 
This may leave a larger gap than is desired. 
As usual, manual placement can be used to override the automatic settings.

<em>Note 2</em>: Automatic chord symbols generated for Fretboard Diagrams are not completely integrated with normal Chord Symbols that may be directly associated with notes on the staff. 
Specifically, focus does not flow from a Fretboard Diagram's chord symbol back to the sequence of other symbols on the page when using <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to move through the chord symbols. 
This minor issue will be addressed in a future update.)

<h4>Use of Chord Symbols with Fretboard Diagrams</h4>
<strong>Add a diagram's Chord Symbol</strong> automatically simply be adding a Fretboard Diagram as described above.
<strong>Delete a diagram's Chord Symbol</strong> by selecting the symbol and deleting it, as with any text item.

<strong>Add a new Chord Symbol to a diagram without one</strong> by selecting the Fretboard Diagram and using <samp>Add</samp>→<samp>Text</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols">Chord Symbol</a></samp> or the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd></kbd>.
<h3>To adjust a Fretboard Diagram's element properties (position, color, stacking order...)</h3>
The <strong>position</strong> of a Fretboard Diagram can be adjusted using the keyboard arrows in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">Edit mode</a>; or with the X- and Y-offsets in the "Element" section at the top of the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.

<strong>Visibility</strong>, <strong>Color</strong> and <strong>Stacking order</strong> can also be adjusted in the "Element" section: see the diagram under <a href="#edit-fretboard-diagram">editing</a>.
<h3>To adjust global/default Fretboard Diagram style properties</h3>
Certain default and global properties of Fretboard Diagrams (see diagram below) can be adjusted from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style</a> submenu: select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-fretboard-diagrams">Fretboard Diagrams</a></samp>. 

Some of these properties are subject to override via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>; but most affect all Fretboard Diagrams in the score.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20style%20400x217.jpg?itok=JVo5UlHP">
<strong>Default vertical position</strong> specifies the default placement of the diagram relative to the staff. 
(Subject to override via Inspector).

<strong>Scale</strong> specifies the default scale (i.e. 
diagram size). 
(Subject to override via Inspector).

<strong>Fret number font size</strong> and <strong>...position</strong> control placement of fret numbers on all diagrams. 
(Global).
<strong>Barre line thickness</strong> controls how large a line is used to represent a barre on all diagrams. 

By default, this is the same thickness as the solid dots. 
A smaller line will allow dots to be visible under the barre, for situations where that is desirable. 
(Global).

<strong>Relative dot size</strong> controls the size of dots on all diagrams, relative to the size of the scaled grid. 
(Global).
<strong>String spacing</strong> controls the spacing between strings, and thus the total width of all diagrams. 

(Global).
<strong>Fret spacing</strong> controls the spacing between frets, and thus the total height of all diagrams relative to the number of frets they each display. 
(Global).

Most Fretboard Diagram properties exposed by the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> offer "reset to style default" and "save as style default" buttons. 
These values do not typically appear on the style page, but are manipulated via the Inspector.
<h3>To edit a Fretboard Diagram</h3>
When a Fretboard Diagram is selected, it can be edited in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> as follows:
The <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> displays three sections related to the Fretboard Diagram:
An Element section that controls the Fretboard Diagram's visibility, placement, color, and other aspects that are used in common with other MuseScore elements; see <a href="#adjust-position-color">adjust element properties</a> and the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> for details.

A Fretboard Diagram section, with control fields and buttons that define the appearance of this diagram.
A magnified version of the Fretboard Diagram, showing its details and allowing editing.
Below is an example of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> with a Fretboard Diagram selected.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20inspector%20338x640.jpg?itok=4Ge7tRpr">

<h4>Editing Fretboard Diagram properties</h4>
(See Inspector properties above in the <a href="#edit-fretboard-diagram">editing</a> example.)

To adjust the <strong>scale (size)</strong> of the diagram: Use <strong>Scale</strong>.
To adjust the diagram's <strong>placement relative to the staff</strong>: Use <strong>Placement</strong>.
To adjust the <strong>number of instrument strings</strong>: Use <strong>Strings</strong>. 

Strings are added/removed from the left side of the diagram.
To adjust <strong>how many frets to display</strong> (i.e. 
the height of the diagram): Use <strong>Frets</strong>. 

Frets are added/removed from the bottom of the diagram.
To adjust the <strong>first fret position</strong>: Use <strong>Fret number</strong>. 
A digit is shown next to the first visible fret.

To specify <strong>thickening of the nut</strong> (a heavy line above the first fret): Use <strong>Show nut</strong>.
Place the <strong>finger dots</strong> as described below.
<h4>Finger dot editing (basic use)</h4>
(See Inspector properties above in the <a href="#edit-fretboard-diagram">editing</a> example.)
To <strong>remove all current dots</strong>, use the "<strong>Clear</strong>" button above the diagram. 
(Note: you could save a blank grid in a custom palette, as a starting point for custom diagrams.)

To <strong>create a dot</strong>, click on a fret in the diagram at the bottom of the inspector; click again to remove the dot.
To <strong>move a dot</strong>, clear its current position by clicking on it; then create the desired dot.
To <strong>create a barre or partial barre</strong>: Click the "<strong>Barre</strong>" button above the diagram; then click at the leftmost position desired for the barre. 

The barre will extend to the right edge of the fretboard. 
<strong>Keyboard shortcut:</strong> Holding the <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> key, click on the string where you want a barre to begin.
To <strong>end a barre before the rightmost string</strong>: Click the "<strong>Barre</strong>" button above the diagram; then click at the rightmost position desired on an existing barre. 

The barre will end at that string. 
<strong>Keyboard shortcut:</strong> Holding the <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> key, click on the string where you want a barre to end.
<strong>To delete a barre</strong>: Click the "<strong>Barre</strong>" button above the diagram; then click at the leftmost position of the barre. 

It will be removed. 
<strong>Keyboard shortcut:</strong> Holding the <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> key, click on the leftmost position of the barre.
To <strong>create multiple barres</strong>: Use the above steps to create one than one barre, e.g. 

to show the third finger covering two strings.
To <strong>adjust the barre thickness</strong>: Use the Style options (Format-&gt;Style-&gt;Fretboard Diagrams) to adjust the barre line thickness relative to the dots. 
This will allow dots to be visible on the barre, for cases where that is desired.

To <strong>Indicate open and mute strings</strong> (optional). 
Click just above the diagram to toggle a string between:
Open (<strong>o</strong>)

Mute/unplayed (<strong>x</strong>)
No indication
<h4>Finger dot editing (advanced use)</h4>
Some arrangers and educators use a more advanced form of Fretboard Diagram that a) incorporates multiple types of "dot", and that b) allows multiple dots per string.
This technique is particularly associated with the many books and arrangements published by <strong>Ted Greene</strong> and his successors. 
(Note: No other notation software currently supports this diagram style.)

<strong>Multi-dot notation style</strong>. 
With this approach, the round dots are played first. 
Then, on successive beats, the notes represented by the other dots are then played in order. 

This allows a single diagram to represent several beats of music. 
(The usual sequence is: dot→X→square→delta. 
Usage varies however.) Here are two examples of multi-dot diagrams.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20advanced%20320x145.jpg?itok=PtrCNWtP">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20four%20note%20400x138.jpg?itok=xztFiZm-">

<strong>Optional-note notation style</strong>. 

Another use of multiple dots per string allows other symbols to show optional notes, rather than delayed notes. 
Typically, a related chord voicing is shown, such as an optional extension or an optional rootless chord version. 
Here is an example of an optional extension.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20optional%20note%20273x138.jpg?itok=EcoBKen8">

MuseScore Fretboard Diagrams allow the creation of these and other types of multi-symbol diagrams. 
A chord is first created and edited using the <a href="#edit-fretboard-diagram">basic steps described above</a>. 

Then, the <strong>multiple dot buttons</strong> above the diagram are used to add secondary notes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-05/MS31%20handbook%20fretboard%20diagrams%20buttons%20220x179.jpg?itok=FpBat6G9">

To <strong>begin adding multiple dots (i.e. 

symbols)</strong> to a diagram, click "<strong>Multiple dots</strong>".
To <strong>add another dot to a string</strong>, click above or below an existing symbol. 
The next symbol in sequence will be placed at that position, e.g. 

if there is already a dot, an X will appear next.
To <strong>remove any symbol from a diagram</strong>, click on it.
To <strong>enter a particular symbol out of sequence</strong>, click on the button with that symbol before adding the dot; e.g. 

to enter an X on a string with no current dots, because that note should be played after the rest of the chord, click on the X and then place it as desired.

(Note: Experienced users of <strong>Ted Greene</strong> style diagrams will find that several secondary features from Ted's diagrams are not yet supported in MuseScore. 

These include: a. 
Displaying the fret number on a higher fret than the first visible fret. 
b. 

Allowing the note symbols to include digits, not just the four dot styles currently supported. 
c. 
Allowing the creation of annotation on and between diagrams, such as circling a particular note, or drawing lines linking notes in adjacent diagrams. 

However, MuseScore does provide many tools for drawing and annotation that can serve in place of these techniques.)
(Note: Because multi-note symbols are not standardized, even within the <strong>Ted Greene</strong> community, users must be careful to indicate how they are being used within a given score.)

To adjust the <strong>fret position number</strong>: Use <strong>Offset</strong>.
To adjust how many frets to display (height-wise): Use <strong>Frets</strong>.
To <strong>place the finger dots</strong>: Click on a fret to establish a dot; click again to remove the dot.

<strong>To create a barre or partial barre</strong>: First make sure that the desired fret position is clear of black dots (click on a dot to remove it). 
Then, holding the <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> key, click on the string where you want the barre to begin. 
(Note: Only one barre can be applied per diagram; a partial barre must end on the first string).

<strong>To delete a barre</strong>: Click on the black dot where the barre begins.
<strong>To Indicate open and mute strings</strong> (if applicable): Click just above the diagram to toggle a string between:
Open (<strong>o</strong>)

Mute/unplayed (<strong>x</strong>)
No indication.
To adjust the size: Use the <strong>Scale</strong> property.

<h3>To adjust a diagram's element properties</h3>
The <strong>position</strong> of a Fretboard Diagram can be adjusted using the keyboard arrows in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/edit-mode">Edit mode</a>; or with the X- and Y-offsets in the "Element" section at the top of the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<strong>Visibility</strong>, <strong>Color</strong> and <strong>Stacking order</strong> can also be adjusted from the "Element" section.

<h3>To adjust a diagram's style properties</h3>
Certain default and global properties of Fretboard Diagrams (e.g. 
barre thickness, vertical position, scale, fret-number font-size and position) can be adjusted from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style">Style</a> submenu: select <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Style…</samp>→<samp><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-fretboard-diagrams">Fretboard Diagrams</a></samp>. 

Some of these properties are subject to override via the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>; but most affect all Fretboard Diagrams in the score.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Layer (experimental)</span></h2>

This feature is still experimental and only visible if MuseScore is started using the '-e' option, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/command-line-options">Command line options</a>
For the Open-Goldberg project, the ability to create different versions of the score was needed. 
One version is the "Urtext", a score which is close to the original version of Bach. 

A second version could be a Czerny variation, which in addition to the Urtext, contains fingerings.
The layer feature allows creating different versions out of one score file. 
If you want to add fingerings, you have to create a layer and tag the fingering elements with the layer name.

First, create layers:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-02/Layer1_en.png?itok=nlRI4Czj">

Second, create a score variant:

<h2><br><span class="orange">Master palette</span></h2>
The <strong>Master Palette</strong> is a repository of symbols used to populate the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a> (Basic,  Advanced, and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces#create-custom-workspace">Custom</a>). 
It is also used to create new <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/time-signatures#create-time-signature">Time Signatures</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/key-signatures#custom-key-signatures">Key Signatures</a>.

To open, use either of the following options:
Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>fn</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd></kbd>).
From the menu, select <samp>View</samp> → <samp>Master Palette</samp>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-01/Master%20palette.png?itok=TPLmH3Qi">
The Master palette is divided into sections based on symbol type. 
Hovering the mouse over an item shows a <strong>tool tip</strong> (a short definition in black on yellow background).
To transfer a Master palette item to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes#custom-palettes">custom palette</a>:

Drag the symbol from the Master Palette window into a custom palette.
<strong>Note</strong>: Except for the <a href="#symbols">Symbols</a> section (below), it is not usual to add items directly to the score from the Master palette: use the workspace palettes instead. 
However, if desired, items can be added directly using either (i) drag-and-drop or (ii) by selecting one or more notes/rests and double-clicking the item.

<h3>Symbols</h3>
The <strong>Symbols</strong> section of the Master Palette is a large repository of hundreds of musical symbols in addition to those found in the preset <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspaces</a>. 
You can open it from the Master Palette, or directly from the score by using the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Z</kbd></kbd>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/symbols.PNG?itok=3K2nX4m9">

<h4>Find a symbol</h4>
The <strong>Symbols</strong> subcategories can be displayed by clicking on "Symbols". 

Use the <strong>font menu</strong> on the bottom right of the box to specify Emmentaler-, Gonville- or Bravura-specific symbols. 
You can search for a particular symbol by entering a keyword in the <strong>search box</strong>.
<h4>Apply a symbol</h4>
To add an item to the score from the Symbols section, use any of the following options:
Drag and drop a symbol onto a staff.
Select a note or rest and double-click a symbol.

The position of the symbol can be adjusted by dragging or by changing the horizontal / vertical offsets in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>. 
Color and visibility can also be adjusted in the Inspector.
<strong>Note</strong>: Elements from the Symbols section do not follow any positioning rules (in many cases unlike identical elements from other sections of the Master Palette), nor do they affect score playback.

<h4>Connect symbols</h4>
Elements from the Symbols section can be connected to each other on the score page, so that they can be moved as one unit:
Apply first symbol to the score. 

Adjust position as required.
Double-click, or drag-and-drop, a second element onto the first symbol. 
Adjust position as required.

Drag the first element and the attached element will follow.

<h2><br><span class="orange">MIDI import</span></h2>

MuseScore can import <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#midi">MIDI</a> files (.mid/.midi/.kar) and convert them into music notation.
<strong>To import a MIDI file</strong>, use the standard <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#open-file">Open</a> command. 
This converts the MIDI file into a MuseScore file (.mscz) and applies the default quantization settings.

The <strong>MIDI Import Panel</strong> appears at the bottom of the screen: you can expand this by dragging the interface with the document window upwards. 
The panel shows all the tracks in the file (only those with note events are shown) and allows you to adjust parameters affecting the conversion process. 
<em>If there are multiple tracks</em>, then one more track is added at the top of the list to select all tracks at once.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/MIDI_Import_Panel_en_1.png?itok=OzUO5BtX, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/MIDI_Import_Panel_en_1.png?itok=pJ-Hhm4T 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_1480/public/MIDI_Import_Panel_en_1.png?itok=8zMv2QJA">
<strong>To accept the default conversion</strong>: Simply press the "X" symbol on the top-left of the Import Panel to close it. 
The panel can be re-opened at any time during the session by pressing "Show MIDI import panel" at the bottom of the document window.

<strong>To reimport the file</strong>: Adjust the desired parameters in the Import Panel (see <a href="#available-operations">below</a>) and press <kbd><samp class="button">Apply</samp></kbd>. 
If you have made changes to the Import Panel but wish to UNDO them, press <kbd><samp class="button">Cancel</samp></kbd>. 
To close the Import Panel, press the "X" symbol at the top-left of the panel.


If you reimport the file after making changes to the temporary generated result score, MuseScore will prompt you what should happen with that modified score: Save it somewhere, Discard it or Cancel. 
The <kbd><samp class="button">Save</samp></kbd> option will save the modified score as a Musescore file in your <em>\bin</em> directory without modifying the original MIDI file. 
 It will then reimport the original MIDI file and apply the import panel settings. 

The import panel settings are NOT applied to the saved file. 
 The <kbd><samp class="button">Discard</samp></kbd> option will UNDO your changes to the Musecore file, then reimport the original MIDI file and apply the new settings. 
The <kbd><samp class="button">Cancel</samp></kbd> option will reimport the original MIDI file in the first tab and apply any import panel setting then create a new tab with your modified score but without applying any import panel settings. 

 The second tab is the same as hitting SAVE, then opening the saved file. 
Therefore, you cannot apply import panel settings to a user modified score. 
 You must first apply the import panel settings, make any changes to the score, then save the score using the standard <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/opensaveexportprint#save-file">Save</a> command.

<strong>Mouse wheel scrolling</strong> (MIDI Import Panel): Vertical scrolling is the default. 
For horizontal scrolling, press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> while using the wheel.
<h3>Available operations</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>MuseScore instrument</em></dt>
<dd>Assign a MuseScore instrument (listed in instruments.xml or in specified custom xml file in Preferences) that defines staff name, clef, transposition, articulations, etc.</dd>

<dt><em>Quantization</em></dt>
<dd>
Quantize MIDI notes by some regular grid. 

The grid MAX resolution can be set via the drop-down menu:
Value from preferences (default) - quantization value is taken from the main Preferences dialog of MuseScore (in the “Import” tab)
Quarter, Eighth, 16th, 32nd, 64th, 128th - user-defined values

</dd>
<dd>
However, the actual quantization grid size is adaptive and reduces when the note length is small, so for each note the quantization value is different. 

But there is an upper limit for the quantization value, and that value can be set by the user as "max. 
quantization".

For example, if some note is long - say, half note, and the max. 

quantization is set to 8th, then the note will be quantized with the 8th-note grid, not the half- or quarter-note grid as it supposed to be by the algorithm.

Such quantization scheme allows to quantize all notes in the score (with different lengths!) adequately.
</dd>

<dt><em>Max. 
voices</em></dt>
<dd>Sets maximum count of allowed musical voices.</dd>

<dt><em>Search tuplets</em></dt>
<dd>When enabled, this option attempts to detect tuplets and applies the corresponding quantization grid to the tuplet chords.</dd>
<dt><em>Is human performance</em></dt>

<dd>If enabled, this option reduces the accuracy of MIDI-to-score conversion in favor of readability. 
It is useful for unaligned MIDI files, when no regular quantization grid is provided. 
For such files the automatic beat tracking algorithm is used which tries to detect the bar positions throughout the piece.</dd>

<dt><em>2x less measure count</em></dt>
<dd>The option is active for unaligned MIDI files (when "Is human performance" is checked by default). 
It halves measure count obtained in the internal beat tracking operation. 

It may be convenient when the beat tracking gives 2x more frequent bar subdivision than necessary.</dd>
<dt><em>Time signature</em></dt>
<dd>The option is active for unaligned MIDI files. 

The user can choose an appropriate time signature for the whole piece if the default detected value is wrong. 
The option is useful because it handles imported tuplets correctly unlike the direct time signature setting from the palette.</dd>
<dt><em>Split staff</em></dt>

<dd>This option is suited mainly for piano tracks - to assign notes to the left or right hand of the performer. 
It uses constant pitch separation (the user may choose the pitch via sub-options) or floating pitch separation (depending on the hand width - sort of a guess from the program point of view).

For drum tracks (“Percussion” sound in the track list) it splits the staff into multiple staves, each of which gets only one drum pitch (i.e. 

drum sound). 
There is also a sub-option to allow/disallow the application of the square bracket for the newly created set of drum tracks.</dd>
<dt><em>Clef changes</em></dt>

<dd>Small clefs can be inserted within a staff to keep chords closer to the 5 staff lines. 
Clef changes depend on the average pitch of the chord. 
Tied groups of notes are not broken by the clef insertion (if it occurs, one can report a bug for algorithm in <code>importmidi_clef.cpp</code>). 

This option is available for non-drum tracks only.</dd>
<dt><em>Simplify durations</em></dt>
<dd>Reduces number of rests to form more "simple" note durations. 

For drum tracks this option can remove rests and lengthen notes as well.</dd>
<dt><em>Show staccato</em></dt>
<dd>Option to show/hide staccato markings in the score.</dd>

<dt><em>Dotted notes</em></dt>
<dd>Controls whether MuseScore will use dotted notes or ties.</dd>
<dt><em>Show tempo text</em></dt>

<dd>Shows/hides tempo text markings in the score.</dd>
<dt><em>Show chord names</em></dt>
<dd>Shows/hides chord names in the score, if any, for XF MIDI file format.</dd>

<dt><em>Recognize pickup measure</em></dt>
<dd>When enabled, this option doesn't change the time signature of the first bar that is shorter than the second bar. 
It is also called anacrusis. 

This option is only available for all tracks at once.</dd>
<dt><em>Detect swing</em></dt>
<dd>MuseScore tries to detect swing, and automatically replace a pattern of 4th + 8th notes in triplets (for the most common swing feel, 2:1), or a dotted 8th + 16th pattern (for shuffle, 3:1), with two straight 8ths and a “Swing” or “Shuffle” text at the beginning.</dd>

</dl>
<h2><br><span class="orange">Note input modes</span></h2>

MuseScore allows you to choose from any of several note input modes. 
<a href="#step-time">Step-time</a> (see below) is the default, but others can be accessed by clicking the small dropdown arrow next to the note entry button on the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">note input toolbar</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2020-01/note_input_modes_3.3.4_EN.png?itok=v_etCc8a">


<h3>Step-time</h3>
This is the default method of note input and involves entering notes one at a time: first by selecting a note duration using the mouse or computer keyboard, then choosing a pitch using the mouse, computer keyboard, MIDI keyboard or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#virtual-piano-keyboard">virtual piano keyboard</a>.
For details see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a>.

<h3>Re-pitch</h3>
Re-pitch mode allows you to correct the pitches of a sequence of notes while leaving their durations unchanged (not to be confused with <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#respell-pitches">Accidental: Respell pitches</a>).
Select a note as your starting point;

Select the <strong>Re-Pitch</strong> option from the  <strong>Note input</strong> drop-down menu; or use the keyboard shortcut, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd></kbd>).
Now enter pitches using the computer keyboard, MIDI keyboard or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#virtual-piano-keyboard">virtual piano keyboard</a>.


You can also use the <strong>Re-pitch</strong> function  to create a new passage from an existing one of the same sequence of durations—by copying and pasting the latter, then applying Re-pitch.
<h3>Rhythm</h3>
Rhythm mode allows you to enter durations with a single keypress. 

Combining Rhythm and Re-pitch modes makes for a very efficient method of note entry.
Select your starting point in the score and enter Rhythm mode.
Select a duration from the note input toolbar, or press a duration shortcut (numbers 1-9) on your computer keyboard. 

A note will be added to the score with the selected duration. 
In contrast to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a>, pressing the <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> key will toggle dotting or not dotting all subsequent durations. 
All following rhythms will be dotted until the <kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd> key is pressed again. 

Unlike <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#basic-note-entry">Basic note entry</a>, the dot is to be pressed prior to entering the rhythm.
Entering rests is similar to adding dotted notes. 
Press the <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> key to toggle entering rests. 

All rhythms entered will be rests until the <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd> key is pressed again. 
This can be used concurrently with dotted notes.
Continue pressing duration keys to enter notes with the chosen durations.

Now use <a href="#repitch">Re-pitch mode</a> to set the pitches of the notes you just added.

<h3>Real-time (automatic)</h3>
The Real-time modes basically allow you to perform the piece on a MIDI keyboard (or MuseScore's <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#virtual-piano-keyboard">virtual piano keyboard</a>) and have the notation added for you. 
However, you should be aware of the following limitations which currently apply:
It is not possible to use a computer keyboard for Real-time input

You cannot enter tuplets or notes shorter than the selected duration
You cannot enter notes into more than one voice at a time
However, these restrictions mean that MuseScore has very little guessing to do when working out how your input should be notated, which helps to keep the Real-time modes accurate.

In the automatic version of Real-time input, you play at a fixed tempo indicated by a metronome click. 
You can adjust the tempo by changing the delay between clicks from the menu: <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Preferences...</samp> → <samp>Note Input</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp> → <samp>Preferences...</samp> → <samp>Note Input</samp>).
Select your starting position in the score and enter Real-time (automatic) mode.

Select a duration from the note input toolbar.
Press and hold a MIDI key or virtual piano key (a note will be added to the score).
Listen for the metronome clicks. 

With each click the note grows by the selected duration.
Release the key when the note has reached the desired length.


The score stops advancing as soon as you release the key. 
If you want the score to continue advancing (e.g. 
to allow you to enter rests) then you can use the <a href="#realtime-advance">Real-time Advance shortcut</a> to start the metronome.

<h3>Real-time (manual)</h3>
In the manual version of Real-time input, you have to indicate your input tempo by tapping on a key or pedal, but you can play at any speed you like and it doesn't have to be constant. 
The default key for setting the tempo (called "Real-time Advance") is <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd> on the numeric keypad (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd></kbd>), but it is highly recommended that you change this to a MIDI key or MIDI pedal (see <a href="#realtime-advance">below</a>).

Select your starting position in the score and enter Real-time (manual) mode.
Select a duration from the note input toolbar.
Press and hold a MIDI key or virtual piano key (a note will be added to the score).

Press the Real-time Advance key. 
With each press the note grows by the selected duration.
Release the note when it has reached the desired length.

<h4>Real-time Advance shortcut</h4>
The Real-time Advance shortcut is used to tap beats in manual Real-time mode, or to start the metronome clicks in automatic Real-time mode. 
It is called "Real-time Advance" because it causes the input position to move forward, or "advance", through the score.

The default key for Real-time Advance is <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd> on the numeric keypad (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd></kbd>), but it is highly recommended that you assign this to a MIDI key or MIDI pedal via MuseScore's MIDI remote control. 
The MIDI remote control is available from the menu: <samp>Edit</samp> → <samp>Preferences...</samp> → <samp>Note Input</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp> → <samp>Preferences...</samp> → <samp>Note Input</samp>).
Alternatively, if you have a USB footswitch or computer pedal which can simulate keyboard keys, you could set it to simulate Enter on the numeric keypad.

When the notes are entered they will be placed just before the selected starting element, which will be highlighted with a square blue marker. 
The start element and any subsequent notes or rests within the same measure will be shifted forward. 
You can move the insertion point forward and backward using the arrow keys  <kbd><kbd>→</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>←</kbd></kbd>, and the new insertion point will then be highlighted.

<h3>Insert</h3>
<strong>Insert</strong> Input mode (called <strong>Timewise</strong> in versions prior to 3.0.2) allows you to insert and delete notes and rests within measures, automatically shifting subsequent music forwards or backwards. 
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#duration">Measure duration</a> is automatically updated as you go.

Make sure you are in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#note-input-mode">Note input mode</a>, and that you have the element selected where you want to start inserting notes/rests;
Click on the arrow next to the Note input icon, and select <strong>Insert</strong> (or if Insert is the current default, just press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>);
Enter a note or rest as you would in <a href="#steptime">Step-Time</a> mode. 

Each note is inserted before the current cursor position;
Move the cursor forward and backward if required (using the arrow keys), to change the insertion point.


Alternatively, if you have only one or two notes to insert, you may prefer to use a shortcut:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd>) while adding the note by Mouse-click or keyboard  shortcut (A-G).
If, at any time, the total duration of the notes and rests within the measure does not match the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/time-signatures">time signature</a>, a small + or - sign will be shown above the measure.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/Irregular_measure_en_0.png?itok=F4UtCeq7">

See also: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tools#timewise-delete">Remove selected range</a> (Tools).
<h3>Normal mode</h3>
To leave Note Input mode, click on the Note Input tool button, press <kbd><kbd>N</kbd></kbd>, or press <kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></kbd>. 
This puts you in <strong>Normal mode</strong>, in which you can change durations and delete notes or rests as follows:
If you select a note and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> the note will be replaced by a rest of the same duration.

If you select a note or rest and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> the note/rest will be deleted, and subsequent notes moved backward (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tools#timewise-delete">Remove selected range</a>).
If you reduce the duration of a note or rest  the remaining duration will be filled with rests.
If you increase the duration of a note or rest it will subtract duration from the subsequent notes/rests to make up the duration. 

If this is done on the last note/rest in the measure, a note or rest with the required duration will be inserted in the start of the following measure, and the two will be tied together.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Notehead schemes</span></h2>

You can choose choose any one of nine <strong>notehead schemes</strong> for a standard staff. 
To set a notehead scheme:
Right-click on a staff and select <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff/Part Properties…</a>; click on <kbd><samp class="button">Advanced Style Properties…</samp></kbd> and choose from the "Notehead scheme" dropdown list.

The schemes are as follows:
<strong>Normal</strong>: This is the default scheme and the one the vast majority of people will use: it is also the only scheme in MuseScore 1 and 2. 
It uses normal noteheads which can be changed via the Noteheads palette or the Inspector.

<strong>Pitch name</strong>: Noteheads automatically and dynamically change to include the English pitch name in the notehead.

Here is an example.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Noteheads</span></h2>
A range of alternative noteheads can be accessed via the <strong>Note Heads</strong> palette of the Advanced <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/workspaces">workspace</a>, or the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> (see <a href="#change-notehead-group">Change notehead group</a>, below).
<strong>Note</strong>: The design of the notehead may vary depending on the music font selected (Leland, Emmentaler, Gonville, Bravura, MuseJazz, Petaluma). 

Those in the palette are displayed as half notes in Bravura font.
<h3>Notehead groups</h3>
MuseScore supports a range of notehead styles:

<strong>Normal</strong>: A standard notehead.
<strong>Crosshead</strong> (Ghost note): Used in percussion notation to represent cymbals. 
It also indicates muted and/or percussive effects in stringed instruments such as the guitar.

<strong>Diamond</strong>: Used to indicate harmonic notes in instruments such as the guitar, violin etc.
<strong>Slash</strong>: Used to notate rhythms (e.g. 
guitar strums).

<strong>Triangle up/down</strong>: Used in percussion notation.
<strong>Shape notes</strong>: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti.
<strong>Circle cross</strong>: Used in percussion notation.

<strong>Circled noteheads</strong>
<strong>Slashed notehead</strong>: A notehead with an oblique line through it.
<strong>Plus noteheads</strong>

<strong>Alt. 
Brevis</strong>: Used in early music notation.
<strong>Brackets</strong> (Parentheses): applied around an existing note (or accidental).

<h3>Change notehead group</h3>
To change the <em>shape</em> of one or more noteheads in the score, use one of the following:
Select one or more notes and click a notehead in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Drag a notehead from a palette onto a note in the score.
Select one or more notes and change the notehead in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#note">Inspector</a>, using the drop-down list under <strong>Note → Head group</strong> (not supported for drum staves).
<h3>Change notehead type</h3>
Occasionally you may need to change the <em>apparent</em> duration of a notehead—i.e. 
 <em>notehead type</em>—without altering its <em>actual</em>, underlying duration:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> one or more notes.

Choose one of the following options from the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector#note">Inspector</a> under <strong>Note → Head type</strong>:
<strong>Auto</strong>: Automatic, i.e. 
apparent duration = actual duration.

<strong>Whole</strong>: Whole notehead, regardless of actual duration.
<strong>Half</strong>: Half notehead, regardless of actual duration.
<strong>Quarter</strong>: Quarter notehead, regardless of actual duration.

<strong>Breve</strong>: Breve notehead, regardless of actual duration.

<h3>Shared noteheads</h3>
When two notes in <em>different</em> <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voices</a>, but of the same written pitch, fall on the same beat, one of two things may happen:
The notes may  <em>share</em> the same notehead.
The notes may be <em>offset</em>: i.e. 

arranged side by side.
MuseScore uses the following rules:
Notes with stems in the same direction do not share noteheads.

Dotted notes do not share noteheads with undotted notes.
Black notes do not share noteheads with white notes.
Whole notes never share noteheads.

<strong>Note</strong>: If two unison notes occur in the <em>same</em> voice they are always offset.
<h4>Change offset noteheads to shared</h4>
To turn <em>offset noteheads</em> in opposite voices into <em>shared noteheads</em> :

Make the smaller-value notehead invisible by selecting it and using the keyboard shortcut V (or unchecking the "Visible" option in the Inspector).
In a small minority of cases (where the smaller value note is dotted) this workaround is not applicable, so use the following alternative:
Select the smaller value notehead and, in the "Note" section of the Inspector, change "Head type" to match  that of the larger value note in the opposite voice.

<h4>Examples of notehead sharing</h4>
In the first example below, the notes of voices 1 and 2 share noteheads by default, because they are all black, undotted notes:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/shared_notes_1_0.PNG?itok=kyAXpTbQ">


By contrast, in the next example, white notes cannot share noteheads with black notes, so are offset to the right:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/shared_notes_2_0.PNG?itok=ePRLarOP">
To create a shared notehead, change the black eighth note's head type to match that of the white note or, pre-3.5, make it invisible (as explained above):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/shared_notes_3_0.PNG?itok=4iRDRH5B">


<h4>Remove duplicate fret marks</h4>
In certain cases, a shared notehead, when pasted to a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tablature">tablature</a> staff, may result in two separate fret marks on adjacent strings. 
To correct this, make any extraneous tablature notes invisible by selecting them and using the keyboard shortcut <kbd><kbd>V</kbd></kbd> (or by unchecking the "visible" option in the Inspector).

<h2><br><span class="orange">Parts</span></h2>
MuseScore allows you to not only create and print a full score but also to generate individual player's <strong>parts</strong> from it.

A part can be created from a specific instrument staff in the main score or even from a specific <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voice</a> within a staff. 
This allows you to display multiple parts (e.g. 
Flute 1 &amp; 2) on a single staff in the score but to extract them as separate parts.

<h3>Part Playback</h3>
Musescore "solos" the Part you're viewing during playback—i.e. 
no other Parts sound. 

This is because the Mixer’s “Play Part Only” box is checked by default.
Simply uncheck the “Play Part Only” checkbox if you want  hear all play enabled tracks while viewing a Part. 
Additionally you can use the Mixer's mute and solo buttons to achieve various partial mixes of all available tracks. 

This can prove quite helpful because it allows you to proofread, arrange and compose within any Part while hearing other tracks for context.
<h3>Create all parts</h3>
The most straightforward method is to create all parts at once. 

Parts are generated on a one-to-one basis from the corresponding Instruments in the  score:
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp> → <samp>Parts…</samp>.
Click <kbd><samp class="button">All Parts</samp></kbd> (MuseScore 3.2-3.3.4: <kbd><samp class="button">Generate</samp></kbd>; prior to MuseScore 3.2: <kbd><samp class="button">New All</samp></kbd>) (parts are named with the instrument name, and a number added to differentiate parts that have the same label in the main score).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-02/Parts_create_All_Parts_en.png?itok=6nHfbbii">

Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd>.


The parts can now be accessed by clicking on tabs above the document window.
<h3>Create specific parts</h3>
This method allows you to generate <em>specific</em> parts  for only selected instruments (rather than all-at-once):

In the Parts window click <kbd><samp class="button">Single Part</samp></kbd> (prior to MuseScore 3.4 <kbd><samp class="button">New</samp></kbd>) to create a part;
In the center pane, type the words you want to use for the "Part title" (this also serves for the corresponding part of the filename when exporting);
Pick the instrument that you want to appear in your part from the "Instruments in Score" pane, and press <kbd><samp class="button">+</samp></kbd> to add it to the "Instruments in Part" pane.

If you wish to create more parts, repeat steps 1 through 3 (<a href="#setup-parts">above</a>) for each part.
Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd> to save the parts.


You have now finished setting up the parts. 
You do not need to do this again, unless you add or remove an instrument from your full score.
<h3>Customize parts</h3>
Once you have generated a part (or all parts), you can select any part at the top and use the controls at the bottom to control not only what instrument is in the part, but also which staves and voices within the instrument are included.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2020-02/Parts_create_Single_Part_en.png?itok=6Xlhyhye">

<h4>Add instruments to a part</h4>
To add instruments to an existing part:
Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
Select the instrument from the "Instruments in Score" pane.

Press <kbd><samp class="button">+</samp></kbd> to add it to the "Instruments in Part" pane.
<h4>Remove instruments from a part</h4>
To remove instruments from an existing part:

Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
Select the instrument from the "Instruments in Part" pane.
Press <kbd><samp class="button">-</samp></kbd> to remove the instrument.


<h4>Select staves for an instrument</h4>
To select the staves of an instrument to include in the part:

Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
Click the arrow next to the instrument in "Instruments in Part" to expand the listing to show all staves and voices of the instrument.
Select the staff to be removed.

Press <kbd><samp class="button">-</samp></kbd> to remove it  from the instrument.
<h4>Select voices for an instrument</h4>
Select the part in the "Parts" pane.

Click the arrow next to the instrument in "Instruments in Part" to expand the listing to show all staves and voices of the instrument.
Uncheck the voices to be removed.
<strong>Note:</strong> If you select only voice 1 for a given staff, then only the content in voice 1 for that staff will be included in the part. 

Thus, in order to share flute 1 &amp; 2 on the same staff, you will need to enter all notes onto both voices, even in passages where they share content. 
You also cannot enter the two parts as chords in the passages where they share rhythms.
<h3>Delete a Part</h3>
Open the Parts dialog (<samp>File</samp> → <samp>Parts…</samp>);
Select the relevant Part in the "Parts" pane;
Press <kbd><samp class="button">Delete</samp></kbd>.

<h3>Export parts</h3>
In order to be able to export parts, those need to have been created first, see <a href="#setup-all-parts">above</a>
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp> → <samp>Export Parts…</samp>;

Navigate to the place you want them to be exported to and select the file format (PDF is the default);
For filename just enter whatever prefix is useful for all parts, or leave the default (the filename of your score);
Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd>.


This will generate files with the names "&lt;title&gt;" + "-" + "&lt;part name&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;". 
In addition, when exporting as PDF, this will also generate "&lt;title&gt;" + "-Score_And_Parts.pdf".

<h3>Save parts</h3>
Parts and score are "linked", which means that any change to the content in one will affect the other, but changes to the layout will not. 
When you have the parts created, they are saved along with the score (if you open the score you have tabs for the score and every part you created).

However, if you wish to save a part individually:
Make sure the part is "active." Select its tab if not;
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp> → <samp>Save As…</samp>.

<h3>Print a part</h3>
Make sure the part is "active." Select its tab if not;
From the menu, select <samp>File</samp> → <samp>Print</samp> to open the print dialog.


<h2><br><span class="orange">Plugins</span></h2>

<h3>What are Plugins?</h3>
Plugins are small pieces of software that add a particular feature to MuseScore. 
By enabling a plugin, a new menu option is appended to the <strong>Plugins menu</strong>: subsequently, when this option is selected, the plugin performs a particular task in the score.

Some plugins come pre-installed with MuseScore—see <a href="#plugins-installed-by-default">Plugins installed by default</a> (below). 
You can find many more plugins in the <a href="https://musescore.org/plugins">plugin repository</a>: some work with MuseScore 3, others only with older versions of MuseScore, and some work with either. 
To tell one from the other: MuseScore 3.x and 2.x plugin code files have an extension of <code>.qml</code>; for older versions, it is <code>.js</code>.

<strong>Warning</strong>: Plugins can potentially contain bad or malicious code, which can compromise or damage your scores or system. 
Plugins are entirely unvetted (except for those that are <a href="#plugins-installed-by-default">installed by default</a>). 
You either need to trust the author or check the code yourself.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<strong>Note</strong>: Some plugins may require the installation of other components (fonts, e.g.) to work. 
Check the plugin's documentation for more information.

Most plugins are provided as ZIP archives: download the plugin's .zip file and uncompress (unzip) it to one of the directories mentioned below (depending on your OS). 
If the plugin is provided directly as an uncompressed .qml file, simply download it and place into one of the same directories.
Once a plugin is installed, it needs to be enabled in the <strong>Plugin Manager</strong> in order to use it—see <a href="#enable-disable-plugins">Enable/disable Plugins</a>.

<h4>Windows</h4>
On Windows, new plugins should be installed into <code>%HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Plugins</code>. 
Alternatively, specify a different folder in MuseScore's <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences">Preferences</a>.

<a href="#plugins-installed-by-default">Pre-installed plugins</a> can be found in <code>%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\Plugins</code> (or <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\Plugins</code> for the 32-bit versions) and in <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\MuseScore\MuseScore 3\plugins</code> on Windows 7 and later. 
These folders should not be modified.
<h4>macOS</h4>
On macOS, new plugins should be installed into <code>~/Documents/MuseScore3/Plugins</code>. 
Alternatively, specify a different folder in MuseScore's <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences">Preferences</a>.
<a href="#plugins-installed-by-default">Pre-installed plugins</a> can be found in the MuseScore bundle in <code>/Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/Resources/plugins</code> (to reveal files in the app bundle, right-click on <code>MuseScore 3.app</code> and choose "Show package contents"), and in <code>~/Library/Application Support/MuseScore/MuseScore 3/plugins</code>. 

These folders should not be modified.
<h4>Linux</h4>
On Linux, new plugins should be installed into <code>~/Documents/MuseScore3/Plugins</code>. 

Alternatively, specify a different folder in MuseScore's <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/preferences">Preferences</a>.
<a href="#plugins-installed-by-default">Pre-installed plugins</a> can be found in <code>/usr/share/mscore-3.x/plugins</code> and in <code>~/.local/share/data/MuseScore/MuseScore3/plugins</code>. 
These folders should not be modified.

The directory names might be slightly different, depending on your operating system's language.
<h3>Enable/disable plugins</h3>
To be able to access the installed plugins from the Plugins menu, they need to be enabled in the <strong>Plugin Manager</strong>:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/Plugin_Manager_en_3.png?itok=pEk_5Aq0">

You do this simply by checking the appropriate tick box. 
This adds the name of the plugin to the list in the <strong>Plugins menu</strong>.

<h3>Create/edit/run plugins</h3>
It is possible to create new or edit existing plugins and run them via the <strong>Plugin Creator</strong>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Plugin_Creator_en.png?itok=UknRjfL2">
Documentation of all available elements can also be found here.

<h3>Plugins installed by default</h3>
Some plugins come pre-installed with MuseScore, but they are not enabled by default. 
See <a href="#enable-disable-plugins">Enable/disable plugins</a> (above) to enable plugins.

<h4>ABC Import</h4>
This plugin imports <a href="http://abcnotation.com">ABC</a> text from a file or the clipboard and converts it to <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats#musicxml">MusicXML</a>. 
Internet connection is required, because it uses an <a href="http://abc2xml.appspot.com/">external web-service</a> for the conversion.

<h4>Notes → Color Notes</h4>
This demo plugin colors notes in the selected range (or the entire score), depending on their pitch. 
It colors the note head of all notes in all staves and voices according to the Boomwhackers convention. 

Each pitch has a different color. 
C and C have a different color. 
C and D have the same color.


To color all the notes in black, just run that plugin again (on the same selection). 
You could also use the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/project/remove-notes-color">'Remove Notes Color' plugin</a> for this.
<h4>Create Score</h4>
This demo plugin creates a new score. 
It creates a new piano score with 4 quarter notes: C, D, E, F. 
It's a good start to learn how to make a new score and add notes from a plugin.

<h4>helloQml</h4>
This demo plugin demonstrates some basic tasks.
<h4>Notes → Note Names</h4>
This plugin names notes in a selected range or for the entire score. 
It displays the names of the notes (as <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-styles-and-properties">staff text</a>) according to MuseScore's <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/language-translations-and-extensions">language settings</a>: voices 1 and 3 notes above the staff; voices 2 and 4 notes below the staff; and chord notes in a comma separated list, starting with the top note.
<h4>Panel</h4>
This demo plugin creates a GUI panel.
<h4>random/random2</h4>
Creates a random score.

<h4>run</h4>
This demo plugin runs an external command. 
Probably this will only work on Linux.

<h4>scorelist</h4>
This test plugin iterates through the score list.
<h4>ScoreView</h4>
Demo plugin to demonstrate the use of a ScoreView
<h4>Walk</h4>
This test plugin walks through all elements in a score

Here you can define:
<strong>Program Start</strong>: Specify whether to start the session empty or to display a score. 

The options are one of the following: <em>Start empty</em> (no score) / <em>Continue last session</em> / <em>Start with new score</em> (i.e. 
New Score Wizard automatically opens) / <em>Start with score</em> (the program default, or one of your own choosing).

You can also choose which panels to display. 

This can be any combination of: <em>Splash screen</em>, <em><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/play-mode#play-panel">Play Panel</a></em>, <em><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#navigator">Navigator</a></em>, or <em><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#start-center">Start Center</a></em>. 
Also select if <em><a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/learning-musescore#tours">Tours</a></em> will be active.
<strong>Folders</strong>: Specify the default folders for score files, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#save-and-load-style">style files</a>, custom score <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#templates">templates</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins">plugins</a>, additional <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files">SoundFonts</a>, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/image-capture">images</a>, and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/language-translations-and-extensions#install-extension">extensions</a>.

<strong>Language</strong>: Choose the language used by the program. 
Translations may be updated from here too. 
Note that language translation updates can also be done via the menu: <samp>Help</samp>→<samp>Resource Manager</samp>.

<strong>Telemetry</strong>: Tick/untick to authorize MuseScore to collect usage data. 
The type of data collected is listed, and updated as needed, in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/node/300080">telemetry</a>.
<strong>Appearance</strong>: Specify a dark or light theme, and the width and height of icons. 

Set display "Font face" and "Font size".
<strong>Auto Save</strong>: How frequently the program autosaves.

Use Canvas to set your preferred color and wallpaper for the score background and paper. 

The default "Background" is dark blue (RGB 20, 36, 51; Alpha 255) and the default "Paper," white.
<strong>Background</strong>: Use this to set the color or background <em>around</em> the score pages. 
Select "Color" then click on the bar to the right and make a choice from the color picker; or select "Wallpaper," click on the file icon and set a background image.

<strong>Paper</strong>: Sets the color or background of the score pages. 
Controls identical to "Background" (above). 
You can also tick/untick "Use the same color in palettes".

<strong>Zoom</strong>: This defines the Default zoom level and keyboard/mouse zoom precion.
<strong>Scroll Pages</strong>: This defines the way that the pages are laid out in the score. 
Choose "Horizontally" for a row layout, or "Vertically" for a column layout. 

To limit scrolling, tick "Limit scroll area to page borders".
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: "Draw antialiased" (the default option) makes diagonal lines and edges of shapes look smoother. 
 "Proximity for selecting elements" controls the distance the mouse may be from an object and still act on it. 

 Smaller numbers require more precision, making it harder to click on small objects. 
 Larger numbers are less precise, making it harder not to click on nearby objects unintentionally. 
 Choose a comfortable working value.

<h3>Note input</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-04/Preferences-Note_Input_en.png?itok=JvwRbU2J, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2021-04/Preferences-Note_Input_en.png?itok=qBNwJSYG 2x">

On this tab there are note input and MIDI remote control preferences. 

Here the following can be set:
<h4>Note Input</h4>
<strong>Enable MIDI Input</strong>: Leave checked to allow MIDI input of notes.

<strong>Color notes outside of usable pitch range</strong>: For details, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#coloring-of-notes-out-of-range">Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range</a> and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Usable pitch range</a>  (Staff properties: all staves).
<strong>Delay between notes in automatic real-time mode</strong>: See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#realtime-auto">Real-time (automatic)</a>.
<strong>Play notes when editing</strong>: When ticked, MuseScore <em>sounds</em> the note when it is entered or selected. 

Tick "Play whole chord when adding note," if you want to hear <em>all</em> the notes of a chord when it is added to. 
You can also edit the "Default duration".
<h4>MIDI Remote Control</h4>
<strong>Midi Remote Control</strong> allows you to use certain keys on your MIDI keyboard to enter notes and rests <em>and</em> to select note durations, without involving the computer mouse or (computer) keyboard. 
The default setting is off.
<strong>To assign a command to a MIDI key</strong>:

Ensure that "MIDI Remote Control" is checked (your MIDI keyboard should be connected before opening the program).
Click the red button next to the option you wish to assign a MIDI key to: the red button now lights up.
Press a MIDI keyboard key. 

The red button becomes unlit and the green button lights up instead. 
The MIDI key has now been assigned to the desired option.
Repeat "2" and "3" to assign other keys.

Once you have defined your key settings you can use the MIDI keyboard to control note input operations. 
 You can verify your key settings by observing the MuseScore <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/viewing-and-navigation#toolbars">Note Input toolbar</a> while pressing the MIDI keys.
To temporarily deactivate Midi Remote Control: uncheck "Midi Remote Control": all MIDI input key action buttons are now greyed out. 

 <em>Note</em>: Your key assignments are always saved between MuseScore sessions and are not affected by deactivation.
<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) The "Clear" option turns off all the green buttons for the <em>current</em> MuseScore session but all the user-recorded MIDI key settings are retained and will be reloaded on the next session. 
(2) A MIDI key setting that is activated cannot afterwards be turned off, and the green button will always remain lit: however it can be overwritten with a different MIDI key by using the red button again. 

(3) If the same MIDI key is accidentally assigned to more than one option, then all the associated green buttons remain lit although only one will work. 
To fix, see "(2)".

This enables you to set the audio interface (API) and specify the device to be used for audio playback: e.g. 
built-in speakers/headphones, USB headset, wireless, etc.
<h4>MIDI Input/Output/Output Latency</h4>
When an external MIDI input device is connected, its identifier appears in <strong>MIDI Input</strong>. 
When the device is connected <em>for the first time</em>, you also need to select the correct <strong>MIDI Output</strong> option in order to enable note input and correct audio playback  (e.g. 
in Windows, this might be "MMS&lt;device name&gt;"): then close and reopen the program to confirm the changes.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Recovered files</span></h2>

If MuseScore or your computer should crash, or if power is lost, a pop-up message upon restarting MuseScore will ask if you wish to restore the previous session:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Restore_session_dialog_en.png?itok=N6xTdVBx">

Click <kbd><samp class="button">Yes</samp></kbd>, to initiate attempted recovery of files from the interrupted session. 

Or click <kbd><samp class="button">No</samp></kbd> to ignore message.
<h3>Saving after session recovery</h3>
When MuseScore recovers files after a crash, it renames them with the full path name added in front of the original file name. 

This very long name will appear in the tab(s) above the active score window.
<em>To ensure that the file is saved in its original location</em>. 
You should immediately save the restored file using the <strong><samp>"Save As..."</samp></strong> option: this will open a window to allow you to navigate to the correct folder and directory. 

If you use the "Save" command instead, the file will be saved in its current location which is unlikely to be the original one.
<h3>Finding recovered files</h3>
In the event that <samp>"Save"</samp> is used instead of <samp>"Save As..."</samp> with a recovered file, you will have to find the files in your computer. 

The actual location of those files will vary, depending on your operating system, and in which directory MuseScore is installed.
For Windows 7, with a default installation of MuseScore to the program files directory, recovered files are auto-saved to <code>C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin</code> (actually <code>%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\bin</code>).
For Windows 10, look in <code>C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin</code> (actually<code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualStore\%ProgramFiles:~3%\MuseScore 3\bin</code>).

You may need to run a system-wide search in order to find files saved directly after a session recovery. 
Use keywords from the original file name as well as wildcards, and specify the date modified.

<h3>Pre-existing meta tags</h3>
Every score displays the following fields in <strong>Score Properties</strong>:
<strong>File Path</strong>: The score file's location on your Computer.
<strong>MuseScore Version</strong>: The version of MuseScore the score was last saved with.

<strong>Revision</strong>: The revision of MuseScore the score was last saved with.
<strong>API-Level</strong>: The file format version.
<strong>arranger</strong>: (empty)

<strong>composer</strong>: This is initially set to the same text as "Composer" on the first page of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a>.
<strong>copyright</strong>: This is initially set to the same text as "Copyright" on the first page of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a> (if you need a copyright symbols, copy/paste this: ).
<strong>creationDate</strong>: Date of the score creation. 

This could be empty, if the score was saved in test mode (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/command-line-options">Command line options</a>).
<strong>lyricist</strong>: This is initially set to the same text as "Lyricist" on the first page of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a>.
<strong>movementNumber</strong>: (empty)

<strong>movementTitle</strong>: (empty)
<strong>originalFormat</strong>: This tag exists only if the score is imported (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/file-formats">file formats</a>).
<strong>platform</strong>: The computing platform the score was created on. 

This might be empty if the score was saved in test mode.
<strong>poet</strong>: (empty)
<strong>source</strong>: May contain a URL if the score was downloaded from or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/share-scores-online">saved to MuseScore.com</a>.

<strong>translator</strong>: (empty)
<strong>workNumber</strong>: (empty)
<strong>workTitle</strong>: This is initially set to the same text as "Title" on the first page of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score">New Score Wizard</a>.

<h4>Entering Work / Movement / Part metadata</h4>
<strong>workNumber</strong> is the number of the larger work (e.g. 
8—for "The Four Seasons," Op. 

8, by Vivaldi).
<strong>workTitle</strong> is the title of the larger work (e.g  "The Four Seasons,").
<strong>movementNumber</strong> is the number of the movement in the larger work (e.g. 

3 for Autumn).
<strong>movementTitle</strong> is the title of the movement in the larger work (e.g.“Autumn”).
It is customary, when using the New Score Wizard, to create a work with the <strong>movementTitle</strong> as title (even though it ends up in <strong>workTitle</strong> then) and, directly after creating the score, amending this information in the Score Properties dialogue.

Every <strong>part</strong> additionally has the following meta tag, generated and filled on part creation:
<strong>partName</strong>: The name of the part as given on part creation (which is also used to fill the corresponding part name text in the top vertical frame—<em>be aware that later changes to one are not reflected in the other</em>).
This meta tag is not present in the main score and thus is not available for use in its header/footer or in an added part name box in the top vertical frame, unless manually added as a new tag to its score properties.

<h3>Header/Footer</h3>
To show the content of one or more meta tags in a header or footer for your score/part:
Make sure that the correct score or instrument part is the active tab;

From the menu, select <samp>Format</samp> → <samp>Style...</samp> →  <samp>Header, Footer</samp>:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2021-11/Header_Footer_dialog.png?itok=y2soI1cE, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2021-11/Header_Footer_dialog.png?itok=g83FGDmd 2x">

If you hover with your mouse over the Header or Footer text region, a list of macros will appear, showing their meaning, as well as the existing meta tags and their content.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2021-11/Tooltip.png?itok=T-_hoDGH">




In this list $I and $i are only available in extracted, linked parts, because the  <strong>partName</strong> score property is only defined there unless, as described above, it is manually added to the main score properties. 
 Not shown in this tooltip, but available likewise, is the <samp>$:partName:</samp> meta tag.

Add tags (e.g. 
<samp>$:workTitle:</samp>, note the leading and trailing colons) and macros (e.g. 
<samp>$M</samp>, no colons) to the appropriate boxes, as required;

Click <kbd><samp class="button">Apply</samp></kbd> to see how the header or footer looks in the score. 
Make corrections to the dialog if required;
If an instrument part is in the active tab, click <kbd><samp class="button">Apply to all parts</samp></kbd>, if you want to apply these settings to all the score parts;

Click <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd> to assign the header or footer and exit the dialog.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Score Comparison</span></h2>

The <strong>Score Comparison Tool</strong> allows you to compare two versions of a score to find the differences between them.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
To open the Score Comparison Tool:

From the menu, select <samp>View</samp>→<samp>Score Comparison Tool</samp>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/Score-Comparison_en.png?itok=mfuW4ZBl, https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Score-Comparison_en.png?itok=MKrs0Bbp 2x">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_900/public/2019-01/Score-Comparison_en.png?itok=TDsNIUDE">
The dialog opens below the document window and consists of three sections (left to right):

<strong>Choose scores to compare</strong>: Select the scores you want to compare.
<strong>Diff mode</strong>: Select how to view the comparison.
<strong>Comparison</strong>: A line by line comparison of the scores is displayed.

<h3>Select score</h3>
The first step is to select the score. 
Use the combo box next to "Score 1" to choose between the currently open scores, or click on the <kbd><samp class="button">Browse</samp></kbd> button to open the File Explorer and select a score from disk. 

Secondly, use the next combo box on the right to choose whether the first score should be the current  version, or the last saved version. 
Score 2 is set to the same score you selected for Score 1, but you may choose another of the open scores.
When you have selected the scores and versions press <kbd><samp class="button">Compare</samp></kbd> to do the comparison.

<h3>Choose view</h3>
"Intelligent comparison" is the default option in <strong>Diff mode</strong>: this displays the differences between the scores in a human-readable format (e.g. 
"Measure 1: Note: property pitch changed from B4 to C5"). 

Change the <strong>Diff Mode</strong> selection to "Raw" if you prefer to see the results displayed in XML code.
<h3>View comparison</h3>
When you press <kbd><samp class="button">Compare</samp></kbd> a list of differences will be displayed to the right, and the score view will automatically change to Documents Stacked. 

In the <strong>Comparison</strong> section, double-click on a difference from the list and both score views will automatically pan to show you the changed element, which will also be highlighted.
<h3>Leave comparison</h3>
To exit the Score Comparison tool, turn off the two options "Score Comparison Tool" <em>and</em> "Documents Stacked" in the  <samp>View</samp> menu.

<h3>Example</h3>
Below you will see two small scores with a few differences between them.

<em>Staff / Part  Properties dialog, as of version 3.5</em>.
<h3>Staff Types</h3>
For practical purposes, there are four different types of staff:

1a. 
<strong>Standard staff I</strong>. 
 A pitched staff used for most instruments except fretted, plucked-string ones.


1b. 
<strong>Standard staff II</strong>. 
A pitched staff containing a <em>fretted, plucked-string instrument</em>, with options to set the number of instrument strings and tuning.


2. 
<strong>Tablature staff</strong>. 
A staff containing a <em>fretted, plucked-string instrument</em>, which displays music as a series of fret-marks on strings. 

Also contains options to set the number of instrument strings and tuning.

3. 
<strong>Percussion staff</strong>. 

A pitched staff for percussion instruments.
It is possible to change one type of staff into another using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Instruments</a> dialog, as long as the original staff is loaded with the right instrument. 
For example, in order to change a standard staff to tablature, it must contain a plucked-string instrument. 

Similarly, to change a standard staff to a percussion staff you need to ensure that it has an appropriate percussion instrument loaded and so on.
Most options in the Staff / Part properties dialog are common to all staves, but each type also has one or two specific options of its own.
<h3>Staff / Part Properties: all staves</h3>
The following Staff Properties options are common to <em>all</em> staves:
<strong>Lines</strong>

The number of lines making up the staff.

<strong>Line Distance</strong>

The distance between two staff lines, measured in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">spaces</a> (abbr.: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp.</a>). 
<strong>Note</strong>: It is <em>not</em> recommended to change this value from the default shown. 

If you need to make the staff larger or smaller, use the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#scaling">Page Settings</a> dialog instead.
<strong>Extra distance above staff</strong>

Increases or decreases the distance between the selected staff and the one above <em>in all systems</em>. 

<strong>Note</strong>: This setting does not apply to the top staff of a system, which is controlled by the minimum/maximum system distance (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-page">Layout and formatting: Format → Style … → Page</a>).
<strong>Notes</strong>: To alter the spacing above just <em>one</em> staff line in a particular system, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/breaks-and-spacers">Breaks and Spacers</a>.
<strong>Scale</strong>


Changes the size of the <em>selected</em> staff and all associated elements, as a percentage (to adjust the <em>overall</em> score size, use <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/page-settings#scaling">Scaling</a> from the <samp>Format</samp>→<samp>Page Settings…</samp> menu).
<strong>Hide when empty</strong>

Together with the "Hide empty staves" setting in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-score">Format → Style ... 

→ Score</a>, this determines if the staff will be hidden when it is empty.
Possible values:
<strong>Auto</strong> (default): The staff will be hidden if it is empty and "Hide empty staves" is set.

<strong>Always</strong>: The staff will be hidden when empty, even if "Hide empty staves" is not set.
<strong>Never</strong>: The staff will never be hidden when empty.
<strong>Instrument</strong>: For instruments containing multiple staves, the staff is hidden only if all staves for that instrument are empty.

<strong>Show clef</strong>

Whether the staff clef will be shown.
<strong>Show time signature</strong>


Whether the staff time signature(s) will be shown or not.
<strong>Show barlines</strong>

Whether the staff barlines will be shown.

<strong>Hide system barline</strong>

Show/hide barline at left-hand edge of the staff.
<strong>Merge matching rests</strong> (as of version 3.5)


Collapse rests of the same duration, at the same position but different voices, into just one.
<strong>Do not hide if system is empty</strong>

Never hide this staff, even if the entire system is empty. 

This overrules any "Hide empty staves" setting in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-score">Format → Style ... 
→ Score</a>.
<strong>Small staff</strong>


Create a reduced-size staff. 
You can set the default from the menu in <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/layout-and-formatting#style-sizes">Format → Style ... 
→ Sizes</a>.

<strong>Invisible staff lines</strong>

Make staff lines invisible.
<strong>Staff line color</strong>


Use a color picker to change the color of the staff lines.
<strong>Cutaway</strong>

Used to create a cutaway staff in which only measures containing notes are visible (e.g. 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossia">ossias</a> (Wikipedia); or cutaway scores). 
This can be used independently of "Hide when empty" or "Hide empty staves".
<strong>Instrument</strong>


The instrument loaded in the <strong>Instruments</strong> (<kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd>) or <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#change-instrument">Select Instrument</a> dialog. 
The sound associated with this instrument can be changed, if desired, in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a>.
<em>Note</em>: The properties below (i.e. 

<em>Part Name</em>, <em>Long Instrument Name</em> etc.) are set to the default values defined in the MuseScore <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/developers-handbook/references/instrumentsxml-documentation">instruments.xml</a> file.
<strong>Part name</strong>

The name of the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/parts">part</a>. 

This is also displayed in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/mixer">Mixer</a> and the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#instruments-and-voice-parts">Instruments</a> dialog (<kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd>). 
Any edits you make to the Part name affect only that particular instrument and no other.
<em>Note</em>: The Part name is defined by the value of the <em>trackName</em> element in the  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/developers-handbook/references/instrumentsxml-documentation">instruments.xml</a> file. 

If <em>trackName</em> has not been defined, the value of <em>longName</em> (i.e. 
"Long instrument name"—see below) is used instead.
<strong>Long instrument name</strong>


Name displayed to the left of the staff in the first system of the score. 
The long instrument name may also be edited <em>directly</em> as a <em>text object</em> (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Text editing</a>).
<strong>Short instrument name</strong>


Name displayed to the left of the staff in subsequent systems of the score. 
The short instrument name may also be edited <em>directly</em> as a <em>text object</em> (see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/text-editing">Text editing</a>). 
Editing affects <em>all</em> occurrences in the score.

<strong>Usable pitch range</strong>
<strong>Amateur</strong>: Notes outside this range will be colored olive green/dark yellow in the score.
<strong>Professional</strong>:  Notes outside this range will be colored red in the score.

<strong>To disable out-of-range coloration of notes</strong>: From the menu, select <samp>Edit</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp> (Mac: <samp>MuseScore</samp>→<samp>Preferences...</samp>), click on the "Note Input" tab, and uncheck "Color notes outside of usable pitch range."
See also, <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input#coloring-of-notes-out-of-range">Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range</a>.
<strong>Transpose written pitches to sound</strong>


This option ensures that the staves of transposing instruments display music at the correct written pitch. 
Set the transpose in term of a musical interval (plus octave if required) up or down.
<strong>Use single note dynamics</strong> (as of version 3.1)


Leave ticked to allow playback of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#single-note-dynamic">single note dynamics</a> (such as <strong>sfz</strong> etc.) and hairpins, diminendo and crescendo lines on single (or tied) notes.
<strong>Navigation arrows</strong>

Use the <kbd><kbd>↑</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>↓</kbd></kbd> buttons, at the bottom left of the Staff Properties window, to navigate to the previous or next staff.

<h3>Staff / Part Properties: plucked strings only</h3>
Staves of fretted, plucked-string instruments have a few extra options in addition to those listed <a href="#common-staff-properties-options">above</a>,
<strong>Number of strings</strong>


Displays the number of instrument strings.
<strong>Edit String Data…</strong>

This button opens a dialog box which allows you to set the number and tuning of strings. 

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/tablature#change-tuning">Change string tuning</a>.
<h3>Advanced Style Properties</h3>
Clicking the <kbd><samp class="button">Advanced Style Properties...</samp></kbd> button opens a window giving access to advanced display options for the staff. 

These will vary depending on the <a href="#staff-types">staff type</a> chosen: see the relevant sections below for details.
<h4>Template</h4>
At the bottom of the Advanced Style Properties dialog there are a number of buttons which allow you to easily change the following:

<em>The number of lines displayed by a percussion staff</em>.
<em>The staff type of a plucked-string instrument</em>. 
For example, you can change from standard staff to tablature and vice versa, or select from a number of tablature options.

Make a selection from the drop-down list labelled "Template";
Press <kbd><samp class="button">&lt; Reset to Template</samp></kbd>;
Press <kbd><samp class="button">OK</samp></kbd> to accept the changes and exit the dialog (or <kbd><samp class="button">Cancel</samp></kbd> to cancel the operation).


<h4>Standard and Percussion staff options</h4>
<strong>Show clef / time signature / barlines / key signature / ledger lines</strong>


Option to turn the display of these elements ON or OFF.
<strong>Stemless</strong>

If checked, staff notes will have no stem, hook or beam.

<strong>Notehead scheme</strong>

See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/notehead-schemes">Notehead scheme</a>.
<h4>Tablature staff options</h4>
<strong>Upside down</strong>

If not checked, the top tablature line will refer to the highest string, and the bottom tablature line to the lowest string (this is the most common option). 
If checked, the top tablature line refers to the lowest string, and the bottom tablature line to the highest line (e.g. 

Italian-style lute tablatures). 
For example:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/TabExample_numbers_upsdn_1.png?itok=zYapfvYq">



<em>'Upside down' tablature</em>.
<h4>Tablature staff options: Fret Marks</h4>
<strong>Fret marks</strong> are the numbers or letters used to indicate the location of notes on the fingerboard. 

The following group of properties define the appearance of fret marks:
<strong>Font</strong>

The font used to draw fret marks. 

8 fonts are provided supporting all the necessary symbols in 8 different styles (modern Serif, modern Sans, Renaissance, Phalèse, Bonneuil-de Visée, Bonneuil-Gaultier, Dowland, Lute Didactic).
<strong>Size</strong>

Font size of fret marks in typographic points. 

Built-in fonts usually look good at a size of 9-10pt.
<strong>Vertical offset</strong>

MuseScore tries to place symbols in a sensible way and you do not usually need to alter this value (set to 0) for built-in fonts. 

If the font has symbols not aligned on the base line (or in some other way MuseScore does not expect), this property allows you to move fret-marks up (negative offsets) or down (positive offsets) for better vertical positioning. 
Values are in <em>sp</em>.
<strong>Marks are</strong>


Choice of <strong>Numbers</strong> (‘1’, ‘2’...) or <strong>Letters</strong> (‘a’, ‘b’...) as fret marks. 
When letters are used, ‘j’ is skipped and ‘k’ is used for the 9th fret.
<strong>Marks are drawn</strong>


Choice of placing fretmarks <strong>On lines</strong> or <strong>Above lines</strong>. 
For example:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/TabExample_lettersabovecontin_1.png?itok=UUYA2U5N">

<em>Fretmark letters placed above line</em>.

<strong>Lines are</strong>

Choice of <strong>Continuous</strong> (lines pass through fret marks) or <strong>Broken</strong> (a small space appears in the line where the fretmark is displayed). 
For example:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/TabExample_numbers_broken_1.png?itok=5vwp-KeW">


<em>Tablature with lines broken</em>.
<strong>Show back-tied fret marks</strong>


If unticked, only the first note in a series of tied notes is displayed. 
If ticked, all notes in the tied series are displayed.
<strong>Show fingering in tablature</strong>


Tick to allow the display of fingering symbols applied from a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a>.
<h4>Tablature staff options: Note Values</h4>
This group of properties defines the appearance of the symbols indicating note values.

<strong>Font</strong>

The font used to draw the value symbols. 
Currently 5 fonts are provided supporting all the necessary symbols in 5 different styles (modern, Italian tablature, French tablature, French baroque (headless), French baroque). 

Used only with the <em>Note symbols</em> option.
<strong>Size</strong>

Font size, in typographic points. 

Built-in fonts usually look good at a size of 15pt. 
Used only with the <em>Note symbols</em> option.
<strong>Vertical offset</strong>


Applies only when <em>Note symbols</em> is selected (see below). 
Use negative offset values to raise the note value symbols, positive values to lower them.
<strong>Shown as:</strong>

<em>None</em>: No note value will be drawn (as in the examples above)
<em>Note symbols</em>: Symbols in the shape of notes will be drawn above the staff. 
When this option is selected, symbols are drawn <strong>only</strong> when the note value changes, without being repeated (by default) for a sequence of notes all of the same value. 

E.g.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/TabExample_durations_1.png?itok=GlA7RFa1">
<em>Stems and beams</em>: Note stems and beams (or hooks) will be drawn. 
Values are indicated for each note, using the same typographic mechanics as for a regular staff; all commands of the standard Beam Palette can be applied to these beams too. 

E.g.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/TabExample_stems_1.png?itok=pwmG-DUR">

<strong>Repeat:</strong>

If several notes in sequence have the same duration, you can specify if and where to repeat the same note symbol. 
i.e.
<em>Never</em>

<em>At new system</em>
<em>At new measure</em>
<em>Always</em>

<strong>Note</strong>: This option is only available if "<em>Shown as: Note symbols</em>" is selected (see above).
<strong>Stem style:</strong>
<em>Beside staff</em>: Stems are drawn as fixed height lines above/below the staff.

<em>Through staff</em>: Stems run through the staff to reach the fret marks.
<strong>Note</strong>: This option is only available when "<em>Shown as: Stems and Beams</em>" is selected (see above).
<strong>Stem position:</strong>

<em>Above</em>: Stems and beams are drawn above the staff.
<em>Below</em>: Stems and beams are drawn below the staff.
<strong>Note</strong>: This option is only available when "<em>Shown as: Stems and Beams</em>" and  "<em>Stem style: Beside staff</em>" is selected (see above).

<strong>Half notes:</strong>
<em>None</em>
<em>As short stems</em>

<em>As slashed stems</em>
<strong>Note</strong>: This option is only available when "<em>Shown as: Stems and Beams</em> and  "<em>Stem style: Beside staff</em>" is selected (see above).
<strong>Show rests</strong>


Whether note symbols should be used to indicate also the rests; when used for rests, note symbols are drawn at a slightly lower position. 
Used only with the <em>Note symbols</em> option.
<h4>Preview</h4>
Displays a short score in tablature format with all the current parameters applied.
<h3>Change instrument</h3>
You can change any instrument in a score to a different instrument at any time.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Staff Type Change</span></h2>
You can change the appearance of a staff mid-score by adding a <strong>Staff type change</strong> element to a measure, and adjusting its properties in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a>.
<h3>Add a Staff Type Change</h3>
Select a measure in the score and, in the "Text" <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/palettes">palette</a>, click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the "Staff type change" symbol, 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2019-01/Staff-type-change-symbol_en.png?itok=yAaZ9iz0">

; alternatively, drag the "Staff type change" icon onto a measure;

Select the symbol, and adjust its properties (see below) in the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/inspector">Inspector</a> as required.

<h3>Staff type change properties</h3>
When you alter a <strong>Staff type change</strong> property in the Inspector, the new value takes precedence over the value shown in the global <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties#common-staff-properties-options">Staff properties</a> dialog. 
Only those property values in "Staff Properties" that cannot be changed in the "Staff type change" dialog will be valid throughout the score.
The properties that can be altered in the <strong>Staff type change</strong> dialog in the Inspector are:

<strong>Offset</strong>

How far the changed staff shall be moved up or down: measured in <em>spaces (abbr.: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp</a>)</em> .
<strong>Small</strong>


Tick the box to create a reduced-size staff.
<strong>Scale</strong>

Changes the size of the staff and all associated elements, as a percentage.

<strong>Lines</strong>

The number of lines making up the staff.
<strong>Line distance</strong>


The distance between two staff lines, measured in <em>spaces (abbr.: <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/glossary#spatium">sp</a>)</em>.
<strong>Step offset</strong>

How many steps up or down the notes in the staff are offset.

<strong>Show barlines</strong>

Whether the staff barlines will be shown.
<strong>Show ledger lines</strong>


Whether ledger lines will be shown for notes above/below the staff lines.
<strong>Slash style</strong>

Whether the notes shall be shown in standard or slash style.

<strong>Notehead scheme</strong>

Allows selection of how noteheads are displayed.
<strong>Generate clefs</strong>


Whether the staff clef will be shown.
<strong>Generate time signatures</strong>

Whether the staff time signature(s) will be shown or not.

<strong>Generate key signatures</strong>

Whether the staff key signatures will be shown or not.
<h3>Example</h3>
To illustrate the use of <strong>Staff type change</strong>, the staff shown below was created using the following steps:
Add a Staff type change to measure 2.
Set size to "Small".

Set "Lines" to 4.
Add a second Staff Type Change to measure 3.
Change "Lines" to 7,

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Staff-type-change_en.png?itok=lgZZe_Fq">

Afterwards the global Staff Properties are changed using  <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/staff-part-properties">Staff properties</a>:
1 Set "Lines" to 2.


2. 
Change "Staff Line Color".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2019-01/Staff-type-change-global_en.png?itok=pw_v39KV">


As can be seen, the change in "Lines" is only effective up to the first staff type change, whereas the change to "Staff Line Color" is effective throughout the score.
<h2><br><span class="orange">Timeline</span></h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The timeline was developed as part of the Google Summer of Code 2017, and is included for the first time in MuseScore 3.0.
<h3>Overview</h3>
The timeline is a navigation tool that displays an abstraction of the score to the order of measure numbers and instrument names. 
There are four parts to the timeline:
<h4>Meta labels</h4>
This is found in the top left corner of the timeline. 
These are the names of the meta rows.
<h4>Instrument labels</h4>
This is found in the bottom left corner of the timeline. 
These are the names of the rows in the main grid.
<h4>Meta rows</h4>
This is found in the top right corner of the timeline. 
These hold the meta values of the score.
<h4>Main grid</h4>
This is found in the bottom right corner of the timeline. 
This holds multiple 'cells' (a specific measure and staff in the score represented as a square)
<h4>Meta</h4>
Meta are elements found on the score that are not notes, but are still important to the score (key signature, time signature, tempo, rehearsal marks, bar lines, and jumps and markers).

<h3>Basic interaction</h3>
<h4>Select a measure</h4>
To select a measure in the timeline, press the mouse button on the cell. 
A blue box will appear around the selected cell and the respective measure in the score will be selected. 

The score view will place the selected measure in view.
<h4>Select multiple measures</h4>
<h5>Drag selection</h5>
Holding <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse over the main grid will create a selection box. 
Upon releasing the mouse button, all the cells underneath the selection box will be selected, as well as all the measures in the score.
<h5>[Shift] selection</h5>
If a cell is already selected, holding <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and selecting another cell in the timeline will stretch the selection to that new cell, similar to how the score does
<h5>[Ctrl] selection</h5>
If no cells are currently selected, holding <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and selecting a cell will select the entire measure

<h4>Clearing selection</h4>
To clear selection, holding <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and clicking anywhere on the grid or the meta rows will clear any current selection.
<h4>Meta values selection</h4>
Selecting the meta values on the timeline will attempt to select the respective meta values in the score.
<h3>Scrolling</h3>
<h4>Standard scrolling</h4>
Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will move the grid and instrument labels down or up respectively. 
The meta labels and rows do not move.
<h4>[Shift] scrolling</h4>
Holding <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will move the grid and meta rows left or right respectively. 
The meta labels and instrument labels do not move.
<h4>[Alt] scrolling</h4>
Holding <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></kbd> and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will move the grid and meta rows left or right respectively, faster than <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> scrolling. 
The meta labels and instrument labels do not move.
<h4>Dragging</h4>
To drag the contents of the timeline, hold the left mouse button and move it around.
<h3>Labels interaction</h3>
<h4>Rearranging meta labels</h4>
All meta labels besides the measures meta may be rearranged in any way. 
By moving the mouse cursor onto one of the meta labels, small up and down arrows will appear. 
Click the left mouse button on the up arrow to swap the meta label with the one above it. 

Click the left mouse button on the down arrow to swap the meta label with the one below it.
<h4>Collapsing the meta labels</h4>
In order to hide all the meta labels while keeping all the meta information on the timeline, there is an arrow that appears on the measures meta when the mouse is over it. 

Click the left mouse button on the large up arrow to collapse all the currently visible meta rows into one row, where the meta values are staggered in that row. 
Click the left mouse button on the large down arrow to expand the meta rows again.

<h4>Hiding instruments</h4>
All instruments--hidden or not--will be displayed on the timeline. 

To start this interaction, the mouse cursor is moved over an instrument label. 
A small eye will appear on the right side of the label that is open if the instrument is visible on the score, and closed if the instrument is hidden. 
Click the left mouse button on the eye to toggle between the two options.

<h3>Zooming</h3>To zoom in or out of the score, hold <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd> and scroll the mouse wheel up or down respectively (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd></kbd> + scroll).
<h3>Context menus</h3>
To bring up a context menu, right-click on the timeline. 
There are three context menus found in these locations: meta labels, instrument labels, and meta rows.
<h4>Meta labels context menu</h4>
Upon clicking the right mouse button on the meta labels, a context menu appears that displays all possible meta labels as well as two options: "Hide all" and "Show all." Next to each meta label in the menu, there is a check box that shows if the meta label is currently being shown on the timeline. 
To show or hide one of the meta labels, select the box of the meta label in the context menu. 
Selecting "Hide all" will hide all meta labels except for the measures meta. 

Selecting "Show all" will display all meta labels.
<h4>Meta rows context menu</h4>
Clicking the right mouse button on the meta rows will display the same context menu as the meta labels.

<h4>Instrument context menu</h4>
Clicking the right mouse button on the instrument labels will display a context menu with the option to "Edit Instruments." Selecting this will bring you to the same dialog as Edit &gt; Instruments... 
or pressing <kbd><kbd>I</kbd></kbd> for the shortcut.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Tools</span></h2>
A number of useful commands can be found in the <samp>Tools</samp> menu.

<h3>Transpose</h3>
This opens the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition#automatic-transpose">Transpose</a> dialog with various options for transposing passages of music.
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/transposition#automatic-transpose">Automatic transposition</a>.

<h3>Explode</h3>
The <strong>explode</strong> command allows you to select a passage of music <em>in a single staff</em> and split (explode) the chords into their constituent notes or voices as follows:
If the passage is all in voice 1, the top note of the chord is retained on the top staff, while the lower notes are moved to subsequent staves.

If the passage contains multiple <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices">voices</a>, voice 1 notes are retained on the top staff, while other voices are moved to subsequent staves. 
All exploded voices are now in voice 1.
<strong>To explode a section of the score</strong>:

Ensure that there are enough staves underneath the source staff to receive the exploded notes. 
Create extra staves if necessary using the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/create-new-score#create-new-score-adjustments-after-creation">Instruments</a> dialog.
Choose one of two options:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">Select</a> a range of measures in the source staff: this allows all notes to be exploded if there are enough staves available.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">Select</a> a range of measures that includes both the  source staff and also extends downwards to include one or more destination staves: This limits the number of exploded notes/voices to the number of selected staves.
Choose <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Explode</samp>.


<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) If the selection is all in voice 1, MuseScore will discard the lowest note(s) of any chord that contains more notes than the number of staves in the selection. 
(2) If the selection is all in voice 1, and If a given chord has fewer notes than the number of destination staves, then notes will be duplicated as needed so that every staff receives a note. 

(3) Any existing music in the destination staves is overwritten. 
(4) If you select a partial measure, the explode command will automatically expand it to a full measure.
<h3>Implode</h3>
The <strong>Implode</strong> command works in the opposite way to "explode":
With <em>one staff</em> selected, all notes in voices 1–4 are combined into voice 1.
With <em>multiple staves</em> selected, the notes in the <em>second staff</em> are copied to the first available voice in the <em>top staff</em>, the notes in the <em>third staff</em> are copied to the next available voice in the <em>top staff</em> and so on.

<h4>Apply implode to a single staff</h4>
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">Select</a> a range of measures in the desired staff.
Choose <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Implode</samp>.


All selected notes in the staff are now displayed in voice 1.
<h4>Apply implode to multiple staves</h4>
Ensure that there is only one voice in each staff.
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">Select</a> a range of measures in the <em>destination staff</em> and extend this selection downwards to include the other staves to be imploded.
Choose <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Implode</samp>.

<h3>Voices</h3>
This allows you to swap the voices of a selected measure-range of notes. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/voices#exchange-voices">Exchange voices</a>.

<h3>Measure</h3>
Join or split measures. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#split-join">Measure operations: Split and join</a>.

<h3>Remove selected range</h3>
This command is used to completely <em>remove</em> an element, or range of elements from the score.
<strong>To remove measures (including partial measures)</strong>:

Select a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">range of notes/rests</a>, or a <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">range of measures</a>;
Use one of the following methods:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>).

Select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Remove selected range</samp>.
<strong>Note</strong>: If the selected range includes only <em>part</em> of a measure, the result will include a measure of smaller duration than the indicated <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/time-signatures">Time Signature</a>. 
This is indicated by a small - (minus) sign just above the system.

<strong>To join measures</strong>:
Select (i.e. 
click on) a barline;

Use one of the following methods:
Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>).
Select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Remove selected range</samp>.

<strong>Note</strong>: To <em>insert</em> notes, see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/note-input-modes#timewise">Insert</a>.
<h3>Fill with slashes</h3>
This command fills the selection with slashes, one per beat:

<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/measure-operations#select">Select</a> one or more measures;
From the menu, select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Fill With Slashes</samp>.


If a measure is empty the slashes are added to voice 1, full-sized and centered on the middle line of the staff:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-02/Slash_notation.png?itok=6WrVOlSm">

<strong>Notes</strong>: (1) If there are already notes in a measure in the selection, the command will put the slashes into the <em>first available empty voice</em>. 

 (2) Voice 2 slashes are full-sized and centered on the middle line of the staff; voices 3 slashes appear <em>small</em> and <em>above</em> the staff; voice 4 slashes are <em>small</em> and <em>below</em> the staff. 
(3) If a measure contains notes in all 4 voices, voice 1 will be overwritten. 
(4) All slashes are set to not transpose or playback.

<h3>Toggle rhythmic slash notation</h3>
This command toggles selected notes between normal notes and rhythmic slash notation:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes#range-select">Select</a> a range of notes or measures (<em>Note</em>: use the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/copy-and-paste#selection-filter">selection filter</a> if you need to exclude certain voices);

From the menu, select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Toggle Rhythmic Slash Notation</samp>.
The selected noteheads are changed to <em>slash noteheads</em> which do not transpose or playback.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-02/Rhythmic%20slash_notation_0.png?itok=WoyL_zoZ">


Slash-notehead notes in <em>voices one or two</em> are fixed to the middle staff line; those in <em>voices three or four</em> are small ("accent" notation) and fixed above or below the staff:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_360/public/2018-02/accent-slash-notation.png?itok=UgvfSmKi">
In <em>percussion staves</em>, notes in voices 3 and 4 are not converted to small slashes but to small notes above or below the staff.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-02/Rhythmic%20Slash%20-%20percussion.png?itok=MJetvpM7">


<h3>Respell pitches</h3>
Corrects accidentals to fit in with the current key signature. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accidentals#respell-pitches">Accidentals: Respell pitches</a>.

<h3>Regroup Rhythms</h3>
This option corrects note <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/ties">ties</a>, durations and <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/time-signatures#change-default-beaming">beaming</a> so that they are grouped according to standard music notation practice. 
For example:

Before:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-12/regroup_rhythms_before.png?itok=S55B4D5g">
After:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/styles/width_740/public/2018-12/regroup_rhythms_after.png?itok=s9QWrOQK">
Any notes that are tied and are the same length as a dotted note will be changed to the dotted note with two limitations. 
(i) Only the last note of a group of tied notes will have a single dot. 

Notes with more than one dot are not produced using this option. 
(ii) Dotted notes will not span from one group of beamed notes to another unless their duration is the same as all of the beam groups it covers. 
Any notes with more than one dot will be regrouped according to the above rules.

To apply:
<a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/selection-modes">Select</a> the section of the score you want to reset. 
If nothing is selected, the operation will apply to the whole score;

Select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Regroup Rhythms</samp>.

<strong>Note</strong>: This is an experimental feature and there are known bugs. 

Articulations and ornaments are deleted and some pitches respelled. 
Ties across barlines may be lost on UNDO.
<h3>Resequence rehearsal marks</h3>
The <strong>Resequence Rehearsal Marks</strong> command allows you to re-order the numbering/lettering of <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/rehearsal-marks">rehearsal marks</a> if, for any reason, they have got out of sequence. 
For details see <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/rehearsal-marks#resequence-rehearsal-marks">Automatically resequence rehearsal marks</a>.
<h3>Unroll Repeats (version 3.1 and above)</h3>
This command creates a copy of the score (in a new tab), eliminates the <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/repeats-and-jumps">repeat barlines</a> and notates the repeat sections in full instead.
<h3>Copy lyrics to clipboard</h3>
This command copies <em>all</em> the lyrics of the score to the clipboard:

From the menu, select <samp>Tools</samp>→<samp>Copy Lyrics to Clipboard</samp>.
<h3>Image capture</h3>
Take a snapshot of a selected part of the document window. 

PNG, PDF and SVG formats are supported. 
See <a href="https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/image-capture">Image capture</a>.
<h3>Remove empty trailing measures</h3>
This automatically removes any blank measures at the end of the score.
