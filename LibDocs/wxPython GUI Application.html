<pre>
There are many graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits that you can use with the Python programming language. 
The big three are Tkinter, wxPython, and PyQt. 

<h3>Installing wxPython</h3>
$ pip install wxpython

<h3>Definition of a GUI</h3>
User interfaces have some common components:
Main window
Menu
Toolbar
Buttons
Text Entry
Labels

All of these items are known generically as <b>widgets</b>. 

<h2>Creating a Skeleton Application</h2>
Let's start by creating a <code>Hello World</code> application with wxPython:

import wx

app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(parent=None, title=&#39;Hello World&#39;)
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()


In this example, you have two parts: <code>wx.App</code> and the <code>wx.Frame</code>. 
The wx.App starts <code>.MainLoop()</code>. 

The wx.Frame create a window for the user to interact with. 
In this case, you told wxPython that the frame has no parent and that its title is <code>Hello World</code>. 
Here is what it looks like when you run the code:

<img src="https://files.realpython.com/media/hello1.c3e5d5e1cdb9.png">

Let's take a moment and rewrite your code as a class:

import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(parent=None, title=&#39;Hello World&#39;)
        self.Show()

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app = wx.App()
    frame = MyFrame()
    app.MainLoop()

You can use this code as a template for your application. 

<h3>Widgets</h3>
Let's go ahead and add widgets:

import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(parent=None, title=&#39;Hello World&#39;)
        panel = wx.Panel(self)

        self.text_ctrl = wx.TextCtrl(panel, pos=(5, 5))
        my_btn = wx.Button(panel, label=&#39;Press Me&#39;, pos=(5, 55))

        self.Show()

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app = wx.App()
    frame = MyFrame()
    app.MainLoop()

When you run this code, your application should look like this:

<a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/hello2.4b3bac9c90eb.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block " src="https://files.realpython.com/media/hello2.4b3bac9c90eb.png" width="400" height="250" srcset="https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/hello2.4b3bac9c90eb.png&amp;w=100&amp;sig=c943d9b392d5c56daa09c61b979236aec515bcbe 100w, https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/hello2.4b3bac9c90eb.png&amp;w=200&amp;sig=5b0b2d5b47ffb7b1c762295e9dcf158f0194216c 200w, https://files.realpython.com/media/hello2.4b3bac9c90eb.png 400w" sizes="75vw" alt="Hello World in wxPython with widgets" /></a>

The first widget you need to add is something called <code>wx.Panel</code>. 
This widget is not required, but recommended. 
On Windows, you are actually required to use a Panel so that the background color of the frame is the right shade of gray. 
Tab traversal is disabled without a Panel on Windows.

When you add the panel widget to a frame and the panel is the sole child of the frame, it will automatically expand to fill the frame with itself.

The next step is to add a <code>wx.TextCtrl</code> to the panel. 
The first argument for almost all widgets is which parent the widget should go onto. 
In this case, you want the text control and the button to be on top of the panel, so it is the parent you specify. 

You also need to tell wxPython where to place the widget, which you can do by passing in a position via the <code>pos</code> parameter. 
In wxPython, the origin location is (0,0) which is the upper left corner of the parent. 
So for the text control, you tell wxPython that you want to position its top left corner 5 pixels from the left (x) and 5 pixels from the top (y).

Then you add your button to the panel and give it a label. 
To prevent the widgets from overlapping, you need to set the y-coordinate to 55 for the button's position.
<h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
When you provide exact coordinates for your widget's position, the technique that you used is called <b>absolute positioning</b>. 
Most GUI toolkits provide this capability, but it's not actually recommended.

As your application becomes more complex, it becomes difficult to keep track of all the widget locations and if you have to move the widgets around. 
Resetting all those positions becomes a nightmare.

Fortunately all modern GUI toolkits provide a solution for this, which is what you will learn about next.
<h3>Sizers (Dynamic Sizing)</h3>
The wxPython toolkit includes <b>sizers</b>, which are used for creating dynamic layouts. 
They manage the placement of your widgets for you and will adjust them when you resize the application window. 
Other GUI toolkits will refer to sizers as layouts, which is what PyQt does. 

Here are the primary types of sizers that you will see used most often:
<code>wx.BoxSizer</code>
<code>wx.GridSizer</code>
<code>wx.FlexGridSizer</code>

Let's add a <code>wx.BoxSizer</code> to your example and see if we can make it work a bit more nicely:

import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(parent=None, title=&#39;Hello World&#39;)
        panel = wx.Panel(self)        
        my_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)        
        self.text_ctrl = wx.TextCtrl(panel)
        my_sizer.Add(self.text_ctrl, 0, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)        
        my_btn = wx.Button(panel, label=&#39;Press Me&#39;)
        my_sizer.Add(my_btn, 0, wx.ALL | wx.CENTER, 5)        
        panel.SetSizer(my_sizer)        
        self.Show()

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app = wx.App()
    frame = MyFrame()
    app.MainLoop()

Here you create an instance of a <code>wx.BoxSizer</code> and pass it <code>wx.VERTICAL</code>, which is the orientation that widgets are added to the sizer.

In this case, the widgets will be added vertically, which means they will be added one at a time from top to bottom. 
You may also set a BoxSizer's orientation to <code>wx.HORIZONTAL</code>. 
When you do that, the widgets would be added from left to right.

To add a widget to a sizer, you will use <code>.Add()</code>. 
It accepts up to five arguments:
<code>window</code> (the widget)
<code>proportion</code>
<code>flag</code>
<code>border</code>
<code>userData</code>

The <code>window</code> argument is the widget to be added while <code>proportion</code> sets how much space relative to other widgets in the sizer this particular widget should take. 
By default, it is zero, which tells wxPython to leave the widget at its default proportion.

The third argument is <code>flag</code>. 
You can actually pass in multiple flags if you wish as long as you separate them with a pipe character: <code>|</code>. 
The wxPython toolkit uses <code>|</code> to add flags using a series of bitwise ORs.

In this example, you add the text control with the <code>wx.ALL</code> and <code>wx.EXPAND</code> flags. 
The <code>wx.ALL</code> flag tells wxPython that you want to add a border on all sides of the widget while <code>wx.EXPAND</code> makes the widgets expand as much as they can within the sizer.

Finally, you have the <code>border</code> parameter, which tells wxPython how many pixels of border you want around the widget. 
The <code>userData</code> parameter is only used when you want to do something complex with your sizing of the widget and is actually quite rare to see in practice.

Adding the button to the sizer follows the exact same steps. 
However, to make things a bit more interesting, I went ahead and switched out the <code>wx.EXPAND</code> flag for <code>wx.CENTER</code> so that the button would be centered on-screen.

When you run this version of the code, your application should look like the following:

<a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/sizers.9f6c203121e6.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block " src="https://files.realpython.com/media/sizers.9f6c203121e6.png" width="400" height="250" srcset="https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/sizers.9f6c203121e6.png&amp;w=100&amp;sig=ef9024be1b46ebd2e2636d963ed13733df364e6d 100w, https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/sizers.9f6c203121e6.png&amp;w=200&amp;sig=c246e06c9963cf0541f874c5df1d67f0aa497f53 200w, https://files.realpython.com/media/sizers.9f6c203121e6.png 400w" sizes="75vw" alt="Hello World in wxPython with Sizers" /></a>

If you'd like to learn more about sizers, the <a href="https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/sizers_overview.html">wxPython documentation</a> has a nice page on the topic.

<h3>Adding an Event</h3>
While your application looks more interesting visually, it still doesn't really do anything. 
For example, if you press the button, nothing really happens. 

Let's give the button a job:

import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(parent=None, title=&#39;Hello World&#39;)
        panel = wx.Panel(self)        
        my_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)        
        self.text_ctrl = wx.TextCtrl(panel)
        my_sizer.Add(self.text_ctrl, 0, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)        
        my_btn = wx.Button(panel, label=&#39;Press Me&#39;)
        my_btn.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_press)
        my_sizer.Add(my_btn, 0, wx.ALL | wx.CENTER, 5)        
        panel.SetSizer(my_sizer)        
        self.Show()

    def on_press(self, event):
        value = self.text_ctrl.GetValue()
        if not value:
            print(&quot;You didn&#39;t enter anything!&quot;)
        else:
            print(f&#39;You typed: &quot;{value}&quot;&#39;)

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app = wx.App()
    frame = MyFrame()
    app.MainLoop()

The widgets in wxPython allow you to attach event bindings to them so that they can respond to certain types of events.

<b>Note:</b> The code block above uses f-strings. 
You can read all about them in <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/">Python 3's f-Strings: An Improved String Formatting Syntax (Guide)</a>.

You want the button to do something when the user presses it. 
You can accomplish this by calling the button's <code>.Bind()</code> method. 
<code>.Bind()</code> takes the event you want to bind to, the handler to call when the event happens, an optional source, and a couple of optional ids. 

In this example, you bind your button object to the <code>wx.EVT_BUTTON</code> event and tell it to call <code>on_press()</code> when that event gets fired. 

An event gets &ldquo;fired&rdquo; when the user does the event you have bound to. 
In this case, the event that you set up is the button press event, <code>wx.EVT_BUTTON</code>. 

<code>.on_press()</code> accepts a second argument that you can call <code>event</code>. 
This is by convention. 
You could call it something else if you wanted to. 
However, the event parameter here refers to the fact that when this method is called, its second argument should be an event object of some sort. 

Within <code>.on_press()</code>, you can get the text control's contents by calling its <code>GetValue()</code> method. 
You then print a string to stdout depending on what the contents of the text control is.

Now that you have the basics out of the way, let's learn how to create an application that does something useful!
<h2>Creating a Working Application</h2>
The first step when creating something new is to figure out what you want to create. 
In this case, I have taken the liberty of making that decision for you. 
You will learn how to create a MP3 tag editor! The next step when creating something new is to find out what packages can help you accomplish your task. 

If you do a Google search for <code>Python mp3 tagging</code>, you will find you have several options:
<code>mp3-tagger</code>
<code>eyeD3</code>
<code>mutagen</code>

I tried out a couple of these and decided that <b>eyeD3</b> had a nice API that you could use without getting bogged down with the MP3's ID3 specification. 
You can install <b>eyeD3</b> using <code>pip</code>, like this:

$ pip install eyed3

When installing this package on macOS, you may need to install <code>libmagic</code> using <code>brew</code>. 
Windows and Linux users shouldn't have any issues installing eyeD3.
<h3>Designing the User Interface</h3>
When it comes to designing an interface, it's always nice to just kind of sketch out how you think the user interface should look. 

You will need to be able to do the following:
Open up one or more MP3 files
Display the current MP3 tags
Edit an MP3 tag

Most user interfaces use a menu or a button for opening files or folders. 
You can go with a <em>File</em> menu for this. 
Since you will probably want to see tags for multiple MP3 files, you will need to find a widget that can do this in a nice manner.

Something that is tabular with columns and rows would be ideal because then you can have labeled columns for the MP3 tags. 
The wxPython toolkit has a few widgets that would work for this, with the top two being the following:
<code>wx.grid.Grid</code>
<code>wx.ListCtrl</code>

You should use <code>wx.ListCtrl</code> in this case as the <code>Grid</code> widget is overkill, and frankly it is also quite a bit more complex. 
Finally, you need a button to use to edit a selected MP3's tag. 

Now that you know what you want, you can draw it up:

<a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/mockup.b145e58828b0.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block " src="https://files.realpython.com/media/mockup.b145e58828b0.png" width="450" height="400" srcset="https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/mockup.b145e58828b0.png&amp;w=112&amp;sig=fa9a713da01a3ebc15fc341b764af9c3c6ea353d 112w, https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/mockup.b145e58828b0.png&amp;w=225&amp;sig=6bfcb6378599846b10ba467612edad6505a41afb 225w, https://files.realpython.com/media/mockup.b145e58828b0.png 450w" sizes="75vw" alt="MP3 Editor in wxPython" /></a>

The illustration above gives us an idea of how the application should look. 
Now that you know what you want to do, it's time to code!

<h3>Creating the User Interface</h3>
There are many different approaches when it comes to writing a new application. 
For example, do you need to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">Model-View-Controller</a> design pattern? How do you split up the classes? One class per file? There are many such questions, and as you get more experienced with GUI design, you'll know how you want to answer them. 

In your case, you really only need two classes:
A <code>wx.Panel</code> class
A <code>wx.Frame</code> class

You could argue for creating a controller type module as well, but for something like this, you really do not need it. 
A case could also be made for putting each class into its own module, but to keep it compact, you will create a single Python file for all of your code. 

Let's start with imports and the panel class:

import eyed3
import glob
import wx

class Mp3Panel(wx.Panel):    
    def __init__(self, parent):
        super().__init__(parent)
        main_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        self.row_obj_dict = {}

        self.list_ctrl = wx.ListCtrl(
            self, size=(-1, 100), 
            style=wx.LC_REPORT | wx.BORDER_SUNKEN
        )
        self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(0, &#39;Artist&#39;, width=140)
        self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(1, &#39;Album&#39;, width=140)
        self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(2, &#39;Title&#39;, width=200)
        main_sizer.Add(self.list_ctrl, 0, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)        
        edit_button = wx.Button(self, label=&#39;Edit&#39;)
        edit_button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_edit)
        main_sizer.Add(edit_button, 0, wx.ALL | wx.CENTER, 5)        
        self.SetSizer(main_sizer)

    def on_edit(self, event):
        print(&#39;in on_edit&#39;)

    def update_mp3_listing(self, folder_path):
        print(folder_path)

Here, you import the <code>eyed3</code> package, Python's <code>glob</code> package, and the <code>wx</code> package for your user interface. 
Next, you subclass <code>wx.Panel</code> and create your user interface. 
You need a dictionary for storing data about your MP3s, which you can name <code>row_obj_dict</code>. 

Then you create a <code>wx.ListCtrl</code> and set it to report mode (<code>wx.LC_REPORT</code>) with a sunken border (<code>wx.BORDER_SUNKEN</code>). 
The list control can take on a few other forms depending on the style flag that you pass in, but the report flag is the most popular.

To make the <code>ListCtrl</code> have the correct headers, you will need to call <code>.InsertColumn()</code> for each column header. 
You then supply the index of the column, its label, and how wide in pixels the column should be.

The last step is to add your <code>Edit</code> button, an event handler, and a method. 
You can create the binding to the event and leave the method that it calls empty for now.

Now you should write the code for the frame:

class Mp3Frame(wx.Frame):    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(parent=None,
                         title=&#39;Mp3 Tag Editor&#39;)
        self.panel = Mp3Panel(self)
        self.Show()

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app = wx.App(False)
    frame = Mp3Frame()
    app.MainLoop()

This class is much simpler than the first one in that all you need to do is set the title of the frame and instantiate the panel class, <code>Mp3Panel</code>. 
When you are all done, your user interface should look like this:

<a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/tag_editor.01b0ac1ff939.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block " src="https://files.realpython.com/media/tag_editor.01b0ac1ff939.png" width="400" height="250" srcset="https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/tag_editor.01b0ac1ff939.png&amp;w=100&amp;sig=ec89c862dfd2d32db070070feef77de9543b6651 100w, https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/tag_editor.01b0ac1ff939.png&amp;w=200&amp;sig=b9be5e771a35e8d0b3de01b06b00b7f855b97229 200w, https://files.realpython.com/media/tag_editor.01b0ac1ff939.png 400w" sizes="75vw" alt="wxPython MP3 Tag Editor" /></a>

The user interface looks almost right, but you don't have a <em>File</em> menu. 
This makes it impossible to add MP3s to the application and edit their tags!

Let's fix that now.
<h3>Make a Functioning Application</h3>
The first step in making your application work is to update the application so that it has a <em>File</em> menu because then you can add MP3 files to your creation. 
Menus are almost always added to the <code>wx.Frame</code> class, so that is the class you need to modify.

<b>Note:</b> Some applications have moved away from having menus in their applications. 
One of the first to do so was Microsoft Office when they added the Ribbon Bar. 
The wxPython toolkit has a custom widget that you can use to create ribbons in <code>wx.lib.agw.ribbon</code>.

The other type of application that has dropped menus of late are web browsers, such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. 
They just use toolbars nowadays.

Let's learn how to add a menu bar to our application:

class Mp3Frame(wx.Frame):

    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent=None, 
                          title=&#39;Mp3 Tag Editor&#39;)
        self.panel = Mp3Panel(self)
        self.create_menu()
        self.Show()

    def create_menu(self):
        menu_bar = wx.MenuBar()
        file_menu = wx.Menu()
        open_folder_menu_item = file_menu.Append(
            wx.ID_ANY, &#39;Open Folder&#39;, 
            &#39;Open a folder with MP3s&#39;
        )
        menu_bar.Append(file_menu, &#39;&amp;File&#39;)
        self.Bind(
            event=wx.EVT_MENU, 
            handler=self.on_open_folder,
            source=open_folder_menu_item,
        )
        self.SetMenuBar(menu_bar)

    def on_open_folder(self, event):
        title = &quot;Choose a directory:&quot;
        dlg = wx.DirDialog(self, title, 
                           style=wx.DD_DEFAULT_STYLE)
        if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
            self.panel.update_mp3_listing(dlg.GetPath())
        dlg.Destroy()

Here, you add a call to <code>.create_menu()</code> within the class's constructor. 
Then in <code>.create_menu()</code> itself, you will create a <code>wx.MenuBar</code> instance and a <code>wx.Menu</code> instance. 

To add a menu item to a menu, you call the menu instance's <code>.Append()</code> and pass it the following:
A unique identifier
The label for the new menu item
A help string

Next, you need to add the menu to the menubar, so you will need to call the menubar's <code>.Append()</code>. 
It takes the menu instance and the label for menu. 
This label is a bit odd in that you called it <code>&amp;File</code> instead of <code>File</code>. 
The ampersand tells wxPython to create a keyboard shortcut of <kbd class="key-alt">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="key-f">F</kbd> to open the <code>File</code> menu using just your keyboard.

<b>Note:</b> If you would like to add keyboard shortcuts to your application, then you will want to use an instance of <code>wx.AcceleratorTable</code> to create them. 
You can read more about Accerator Tables in the wxPython <a href="https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/wx.AcceleratorTable.html">documentation</a>.

To create an event binding, you will need to call <code>self.Bind()</code>, which binds the frame to <code>wx.EVT_MENU</code>. 
When you use <code>self.Bind()</code> for a menu event, you need to not only tell wxPython which <code>handler</code> to use, but also which <code>source</code> to bind the handler to. 

Finally, you must call the frame's <code>.SetMenuBar()</code> and pass it the menubar instance for it to be shown to the user.

Now that you have the menu added to your frame, let's go over the menu item's event handler, which is reproduced again below:

def on_open_folder(self, event):
    title = &quot;Choose a directory:&quot;
    dlg = wx.DirDialog(self, title, style=wx.DD_DEFAULT_STYLE)
    if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
        self.panel.update_mp3_listing(dlg.GetPath())
    dlg.Destroy()

Since you want the user to choose a folder that contains MP3s, you will want to use wxPython's <code>wx.DirDialog</code>. 
The <code>wx.DirDialog</code> allows the user to only open directories.

You can set the dialog's title and various style flags. 
To show the dialog, you will need to call <code>.ShowModal()</code>. 
This will cause the dialog to show modally, which means that the user won't be able to interact with your main application while the dialog is shown.

If the user presses the dialog's <em>OK</em> button, you can get the user's path choice via the dialog's <code>.GetPath()</code>. 
You will want to pass that path to your panel class, which you can do here by calling the panel's <code>.update_mp3_listing()</code>.

Finally you need to close the dialog. 
To close a dialog, the recommended method is to call its <code>.Destroy()</code>. 

Dialogs do have a <code>.Close()</code> method, but that basically just hides the dialog, and it will not destroy itself when you close your application, which can lead to weird issues such as your application now shutting down properly. 
It's simpler to call <code>.Destroy()</code> on the dialog to prevent this issue.

Now let's update your <code>Mp3Panel</code> class. 
You can start by updating <code>.update_mp3_listing()</code>:

def update_mp3_listing(self, folder_path):
    self.current_folder_path = folder_path
    self.list_ctrl.ClearAll()

    self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(0, &#39;Artist&#39;, width=140)
    self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(1, &#39;Album&#39;, width=140)
    self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(2, &#39;Title&#39;, width=200)
    self.list_ctrl.InsertColumn(3, &#39;Year&#39;, width=200)

    mp3s = glob.glob(folder_path + &#39;/*.mp3&#39;)
    mp3_objects = []
    index = 0
    for mp3 in mp3s:
        mp3_object = eyed3.load(mp3)
        self.list_ctrl.InsertItem(index, 
            mp3_object.tag.artist)
        self.list_ctrl.SetItem(index, 1, 
            mp3_object.tag.album)
        self.list_ctrl.SetItem(index, 2, 
            mp3_object.tag.title)
        mp3_objects.append(mp3_object)
        self.row_obj_dict[index] = mp3_object
        index += 1

Here you set the current directory to the specified folder and then you clear the list control. 
This keeps the list control fresh and only showing the MP3s that you are currently working on. 
That also means that you need to re-insert all the columns again.

Next, you'll want to take the folder that was passed in and use Python's <code>glob</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html">module</a> to search for MP3 files.

Then you can loop over the MP3s and turn them into <code>eyed3</code> objects. 
You can do this by calling the <code>.load()</code> of <code>eyed3</code>. 
Assuming that the MP3s have the appropriate tags already, you can then add the artist, album, and title of the MP3 to the list control. 

Interestingly, the method of adding a new row to a list control object is by calling <code>.InsertItem()</code> for the first column and <code>SetItem()</code> for all the subsequent columns. 

The last step is to save off your MP3 object to your Python dictionary, <code>row_obj_dict</code>.

Now you need to update the <code>.on_edit()</code> event handler so that you can edit an MP3's tags:

def on_edit(self, event):
    selection = self.list_ctrl.GetFocusedItem()
    if selection &gt;= 0:
        mp3 = self.row_obj_dict[selection]
        dlg = EditDialog(mp3)
        dlg.ShowModal()
        self.update_mp3_listing(self.current_folder_path)
        dlg.Destroy()

The first thing you need to do is get the user's selection by calling the list control's <code>.GetFocusedItem()</code>.

If the user has not selected anything in the list control, it will return <code>-1</code>. 
Assuming that the user did select something, you will want to extract the MP3 object from your dictionary and open a MP3 tag editor dialog. 
This will be a custom dialog that you will use to edit the artist, album, and title tags of the MP3 file. 

As usual, show the dialog modally. 
When the dialog closes, the last two lines in <code>.on_edit()</code> will execute. 
These two lines will update the list control so it displays the current MP3 tag information that the user just edited and destroy the dialog.
<h4>Creating an Editing Dialog</h4>

The final piece of the puzzle is creating an MP3 tag editing dialog. 
For brevity, we will skip sketching out this interface as it is a series of rows that contains labels and text controls. 
The text controls should have the existing tag information pre-populated within them. 
You can create a label for the text controls by creating instances of <code>wx.StaticText</code>.

When you need to create a custom dialog, the <code>wx.Dialog</code> class is your friend. 
You can use that to design the editor:

class EditDialog(wx.Dialog):    
    def __init__(self, mp3):
        title = f&#39;Editing &quot;{mp3.tag.title}&quot;&#39;
        super().__init__(parent=None, title=title)        
        self.mp3 = mp3        
        self.main_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)        
        self.artist = wx.TextCtrl(
            self, value=self.mp3.tag.artist)
        self.add_widgets(&#39;Artist&#39;, self.artist)        
        self.album = wx.TextCtrl(
            self, value=self.mp3.tag.album)
        self.add_widgets(&#39;Album&#39;, self.album)        
        self.title = wx.TextCtrl(
            self, value=self.mp3.tag.title)
        self.add_widgets(&#39;Title&#39;, self.title)        
        btn_sizer = wx.BoxSizer()
        save_btn = wx.Button(self, label=&#39;Save&#39;)
        save_btn.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_save)        
        btn_sizer.Add(save_btn, 0, wx.ALL, 5)
        btn_sizer.Add(wx.Button(
            self, id=wx.ID_CANCEL), 0, wx.ALL, 5)
        self.main_sizer.Add(btn_sizer, 0, wx.CENTER)        
        self.SetSizer(self.main_sizer)

Here you want to start off by sub-classing <code>wx.Dialog</code> and giving it a custom title based on the title of the MP3 that you are editing.

Next you can create the sizer you want to use and the widgets. 
To make things easier, you can create a helper method called <code>.add_widgets()</code> for adding the <code>wx.StaticText</code> widgets as rows with the text control instances. 
The only other widget here is the <em>Save</em> button. 

Let's write the <code>add_widgets</code> method next:

    def add_widgets(self, label_text, text_ctrl):
        row_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.HORIZONTAL)
        label = wx.StaticText(self, label=label_text,
                              size=(50, -1))
        row_sizer.Add(label, 0, wx.ALL, 5)
        row_sizer.Add(text_ctrl, 1, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)
        self.main_sizer.Add(row_sizer, 0, wx.EXPAND)

<code>add_widgets()</code> takes the label's text and the text control instance. 
It then creates a horizontally oriented <code>BoxSizer</code>.

Next you will create an instance of <code>wx.StaticText</code> using the passed-in text for its label parameter. 
You will also set its size to be <code>50</code> pixels wide and the default height is set with a <code>-1</code>. 
Since you want the label before the text control, you will add the StaticText widget to your BoxSizer first and then add the text control .

Finally, you want to add the horizontal sizer to the top level vertical sizer. 
By nesting the sizers in each other, you can design complex applications.

Now you will need to create the <code>on_save()</code> event handler so that you can save your changes:

    def on_save(self, event):
        self.mp3.tag.artist = self.artist.GetValue()
        self.mp3.tag.album = self.album.GetValue()
        self.mp3.tag.title = self.title.GetValue()
        self.mp3.tag.save()
        self.Close()

Here you set the tags to the contents of the text controls and then call the <code>eyed3</code> object's <code>.save()</code>. 
Finally, you call the <code>.Close()</code> of the dialog. 
The reason you call .<code>Close()</code> here instead of <code>.Destroy()</code> is that you already call <code>.Destroy()</code> in the <code>.on_edit()</code> of your panel subclass. 

Now your application is complete!
