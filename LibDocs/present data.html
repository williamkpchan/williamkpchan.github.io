"The security threat landscape is constantly evolving",
"Microsoft has spent over a decade tracking and analyzing software vulnerabilities, exploits, malware, unwanted software, and attacker group methods and tactics via the Security Intelligence Report. ",
"organizations move to the cloud and invest into modern technologies ",
"Microsoft continues its commitment to analyzing and informing the security community with deep insights on the latest threats.",
"we will discuss learnings from the Security Intelligence Report that include analysis of the top security threat trends we saw",
"dive deep into insights on attack vectors",
"actionable recommendations from a security industry veteran and a former CISO for your organization to protect and defend itself against these threats. ",
"Key takeways from this webinar include:",
"Learn about the top security threat trends in 2017",
"Gain insight into attack vectors and attacker techniques",
"Hear recommendations and approaches on how to protect your organization from the latest threats",
"Webcast: Microsoft Security Intelligence Report—Breaking Botnets and Wrestling Ransomware",
"Sometimes the best part of building something is getting to rebuild it again a little farther down the line. ",
"Don’t tell anyone, but sometimes when we start a project we don’t even know where the end is going to be. It’s a starting point, not an end destination. ",
"Who wants to do something once when you could do it twice?  Maybe even three times for good measure?",
"Tied into his Home Assistant automation system, a smack of the button plays music throughout the house and starts changing the colors on his Philips Hue lights. ",
"His initial version worked well enough, but in the video after the break, he walks through the evolution of this one-off gadget into a general purpose IoT interface he can use for other projects.",
"The general idea is pretty simple, the big physical button on the top of the device resets the internal ESP8266, which is programmed to connect to his home WiFi and send a signal to his MQTT server. ",
"In the earlier versions of the button there was quite a bit of support electronics to handle converting the momentary action of the button to a “hard” power control for the ESP8266. ",
"But as the design progressed, he realized he could put the ESP8266 to deep sleep after it sends the signal, and just use the switch to trigger a reset on the chip.",
"Additional improvements in the newer version of the button include switching from alkaline AA batteries to a rechargeable lithium-ion pack, and even switching over to a bare ESP8266 rather than the NodeMCU development board he was using for the first iteration.",
"For another take on MQTT home automation with the ESP8266, check out this automatic garage door control system. ",
"If the idea of triggering a party at the push of a button has your imagination going, we’ve seen some elaborate versions of that idea as well.",
"Has this ever happened to you?",
"You spot an opportunity for your company to do something better. ",
"You flesh out the idea, develop the proposal, and present it to the decision-makers.",
"And nothing happens.",
"Why do managers and business leaders pass on great ideas?",
"Sometimes it boils down to apathy, aversion to change, and unconscious biases. ",
"Hard data can get you past all that—and give you the concrete proof you need to get to yes.",
"We designed our newest Pro Intensive, Introduction to Data Analysis, to teach professionals from every industry to persuade through data. ",
"This is the only course of its kind that doesn’t just teach the technical side—but also how to communicate your findings.",
"In your capstone project, you’ll solve a real-life data analysis problem and present your results. ",
"Our team of professional advisors, mentors, and industry leaders will help you strengthen your data-driven persuasion skills—which you can then apply to your career.",
"Next time, deliver a presentation with facts that your boss can’t ignore. ",
"Reserve your seat in our next Introduction to Data Analysis course. "
