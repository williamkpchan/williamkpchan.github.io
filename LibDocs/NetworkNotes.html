<h2>5 Tools to Manage Multiple Network Connection Profiles</h2>
Every home or work network you connect to can conceivably have different settings for the connection. 
At home you might <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/how-do-i-know-if-someone-is-using-my-wireless-network-wifi/">use a WiFi connection</a> with default or automatic settings, for work you might have a manually set IP address and gateway or <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/test-change-dns-servers-quickly-dns-jumper/">custom DNS servers</a>. 
Each different network configuration you come across requires the settings in Windows to be adjusted to match. 
While this isn&#8217;t a major problem because Windows allows you to change these types of settings, it isn&#8217;t the quickest thing to get at and change regularly.
Manual reconfiguration each time through <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/repair-xp-and-vista-internet-connection-problems-with-icr/">Windows Network Connections</a> is both time consuming and inefficient. 
It requires you to remember each individual setting or the network might not connect properly. 
An easy solution is being able to create different network profiles for different scenarios, so you can save <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/6-free-websites-to-map-ip-addresses-to-geographical-locations/">IP address</a>, DNS, default gateway and other settings for each network connection you encounter. 
When you need to change to a different network, a different profile can easily be applied which changes all the required settings automatically.
Here are 5 free tools for you to create and apply network profiles.

<h3>1. TCP/IP Manager</h3>
TCP/IP Manager has a good mix of the ability to easily save network settings into a series of profiles and enough features and functions to cater for most users. 
The program is open source and available in both setup installer and portable versions. 
Make sure to get the correct 32-bit or 64-bit version for your system.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tcpip_manager.png">

After launching the program click Create a new profile and give it a name. 
Choose a network adapter from the drop down and configure the IP address, subnet, gateway and DNS servers. 
Automatic options are also available like in Windows. 
Optionally go to the Profile settings tab and choose to show the profile in the tray menu and give it a keyboard shortcut so you can launch the profile by a key combination. 
Finally click Save current profile. 
When you want to launch a profile click Apply in the window, press the hotkey combination or select from the tray icon context menu.
Proxy servers can be configured from the corresponding tab, advanced settings include changing the computer name, changing the workgroup name and possibly a unique feature of allowing MAC spoofing on the network adapter. 
TCP/IP Manager was quite reasonable on memory usage consuming around 4MB while sitting in the tray.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/2089/" rel="nofollow">Download TCP/IP Manager</a>

<h3>2. IP Shifter</h3>
If you just want a nice and simple network connection changer, IP Shifter is relatively easy to use and doesn&#8217;t require tons of knowledge to configure. 
It also has a portable version so installation isn&#8217;t necessary either.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ip_shifter.png">

Start the program, click the button to create a new profile and give it a name. 
The standard options allow you to select the network adapter from the drop down and then obtain an automatic or manual IP address and DNS server. 
This window is similar to the Windows Internet Protocol 4 Properties dialog and has boxes for IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS servers. 
Proxies for Internet Explorer and Firefox can be setup by clicking on Settings and the check box near the bottom.
Once all the profiles are setup you can switch between them by selecting and clicking Apply in the main window or minimize the program to the tray and right click on the tray icon. 
IP Shifter used around 3MB of memory while in the tray. 
A couple of useful extras are in the Tools menu to Ping an address, scan the LAN for computers and obtain your public IP address.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3631/" rel="nofollow">Download IP Shifter</a>

<h3>3. NetSetMan</h3>
In contrast to IP Shifter, NetSetMan is loaded with tons of options and may be a bit too much for the average user. 
For geeks and advanced users though, it&#8217;s one of the most feature rich network profiling tools around. 
Only a setup installer is available but it can create a portable version because the program can be extracted to the folder of your choice.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/netsetman.png">

Most of the settings can be left alone if you only want a simple IP and DNS changer. 
Choose a renamable SET tab to edit the profile and enter enter the IP, gateway and DNS information or leave what you don&#8217;t need on automatic. 
Use the Activate button or the tray context menu to choose between them. 
The IP+ button takes you to an advanced settings window where extra functions such as routing tables, DNS suffixes and expert settings like running Windows ipconfig commands are available.
Other more advanced networking options like a built in WiFi connection manager, computer name and workgroup changer, create network drives, append to the HOSTS file and a dedicated IPv6 settings window could all prove useful. 
Other options like changing the default printer, changing dozens of system settings or running a script/program are nice additions but not strictly necessary. 
NetSetMan uses around 8MB of memory in the background. 
The free personal use only version cannot change proxies, browser home pages and network domains.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3632/" rel="nofollow">Download NetSetMan</a>

<h3>4. Net Profiles Mod</h3>
This is a modified and forked version of the discontinued Net Profiles tool which has not been updated since 2011. 
Luckily this open source modded version is still in active development so there&#8217;s a fair chance bugs and issues will be fixed in future.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/net_profiles_mod.png">

Setting up a new profile is easy and for basic usage you only have to give it a name, select a network (if there are multiple) and enter the IP and DNS details manually if required. 
Use the Get Current Settings button to create a profile of your current network configuration. 
Additional options include proxies, default browser homepage, mapped drives, default printer, running an application, desktop resolution/wallpaper and connection to a specific SSID. 
File &gt; Create Desktop Shortcut allows launching a profile via shortcut without having the program running in the background.
There are a couple of issues we had with Net Profiles Mod. 
Firstly, our WiFi adapter was not recognized unless it was connected to a wireless network. 
Secondly, you cannot obtain an IP address automatically through DHCP and set the DNS servers manually, or vice versa. 
This is easily possible through Windows and a drawback if you want to change the DNS but leave the IP alone.

<h3>5. Argon Network Switcher</h3>
Argon Network Switcher is a middle of the road type of tool in terms of features. 
It has enough to satisfy all but the most advanced users but not too many to confuse people.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/argon_network_switcher.png">

Usage is similar to the other tools here. 
Click New to create a new profile, enter a name, select the network adapter and then enter the IP, subnet, gateway and DNS addresses. 
Click Save to add the profile. 
Additional options include assigning a specific WiFi SSID, proxy settings, map a drive, set the default printer, start and stop system services, run scripts and applications and also disabling a specific network adapter on running the profile. 
An interesting feature is Autorun which leaves it up to the program to determine the best profile to launch.
We did notice a couple of bugs during usage. 
One was the WiFi SSID profiles are not displayed for everyone so you can&#8217;t associate a wireless SSID with the network profile. 
Another was using the Test button in the Drive Map tab freezes the program. 
However, mounting and unmounting networked drives does work fine. 
Network Switcher consumes about 10-15MB of RAM when minimized to the tray.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3634/" rel="nofollow">Download Argon Network Switcher</a>
<em>Final Note: </em>We did also look at a few other network connection profiling tools, one we almost included was <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3635/" rel="nofollow">Eusing Free IP Switcher</a>. 
This tool is like an easier to use version of NetSetMan but a major issue is a donate popup nag every time the program launches. 
This is a shame as it has a good blend of ease of use and features to make it useful.

<h2>Accessing WAMP From Computers on Your LAN</h2>
<a href="https://john-dugan.com/access-wamp-from-lan-computers/" class="whitebut ">Accessing WAMP From Computers on Your LAN</a>

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24005828/how-to-enable-local-network-users-to-access-my-wamp-sites" class="whitebut ">enable local network users to access my WAMP sites</a>

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36810669/why-wamp-server-put-online-offline-option-is-missing/36825283" class="whitebut ">wamp server put online/ offline</a>

Right click Wampmanager -> WAMPSetting -> Menu Item: Online/Offline

If you click it so there is a Tick beside it, you will see the Online/Offline menu on the left click menu.

However it was made optional as its use is defunct.

You should create Virtual Hosts for each of your projects, then you can amend each of those individually to control the Apache access rules.

In fact in WAMPServer 3 or greater, there is a Virtual Host defined for localhost so this old Online/Offline process wont actually do what you want.

You now have to go to the wamp\bin\apache\apache{version}\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf file and manually amend that entry

&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www
    &lt;Directory  "D:/wamp/www/">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted                  #&lt;-- changed line
    &lt;/Directory>
&lt;/VirtualHost>

This file can be edited using the wampmanager menus like this
wampmanager -> Apache -> httpd-vhosts.conf

However it is not recommended to allow this sort of access to localhost. It is better to create a Virtual Hosts for each of your projects eg

&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www
    &lt;Directory  "D:/wamp/www/">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require local
    &lt;/Directory>
&lt;/VirtualHost>

&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName project1.dev
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www/project1
    &lt;Directory  "D:/wamp/www/project1">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory>
&lt;/VirtualHost>

<h2>Sci-Hub 用上了分布式网络</h2>
在网站域名屡次被撤销之后， Sci-Hub 创始人 Alexandra Elbakyan 在分布式域名网络 Handshake 上注册了新的网站。

现在，每个用户都可以直接通过服务门户和 NextDNS 直接访问 Sci-Hub。

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/KmXPKA19gW9mkBqdBCp94269UtFWSXwVKf5bzAj8gh8YzGa7V5KvCricAp7ViaI0O9qrEv3Q8s5YrVOHiafdAdHKQ/640">

NextDNS：https://learn.namebase.io/starting-from-zero/how-to-access-handshake-sites#level-3-dns
HNS 网关 http://sci-hub.hns.hns.to/
这些年来，一直是 Alexandra Elbakyan 在维护 Sci-Hub，目前所有用户只能通过俄罗斯的 Yandex 和比特币赞助网站的运营。

此前，Sci-Hub 被多次撤销域名，推特账户又被封禁且无法申诉，传统域名系统显然不那么满足这个「盗版学术论文数据库」的需求，能够对抗审查的 DNS 成为 Sci-Hub 保持可访问状态的方法之一。
Handshake 工作原理Tieshun Roquerre 介绍说，Handshake 实际上是一个分布式的域名服务器。
它不使用 web 标准证书颁发机构来验证用户与服务器的连接，而是存储对在其系统中注册的网站的 IP 地址的引用。
这样一来，如果证书颁发机构公司试图通过旧版系统审查 Sci-Hub 的域名，那么想要访问网站的人仍然可以通过 Handshake 的记录访问。
Namebase 则是为用户提供访问 Handshake 网络的平台，这个名字对于国内开发者来说不算陌生。

去年，关于「Namebase 羊毛现金福利」的消息一度引起热议，「满足条件的 GitHub 开发者可以获得大约 4200 个 HNS 代币的奖励」，折合人民币 5000 元左右，还有成功领取者写出了「从天上接馅饼」的教程。
Namebase CEO Tieshun Roquerre 介绍说：「DNS 就像互联网的电话簿，电话簿中的地址是服务器 IP 地址。
DNS 的创建是为了给 IP 地址提供人类可读的名称，因此在这一平台上，用户可以通过 Handshake 找到 IP 地址，而不是通过证书颁发机构。
」Roquerre 提到：「如果你的服务器级别受到限制，则可以切换服务器。
但如果你的域名被删除，就没人能访问你的网站了。

只要名称完好无损，就可以将其指向任何服务器。
」即使 band 网站找到了一个新域名，但用户也不确定其真实性（例如 Sci-Hub 也经常被冒名顶替）。
要注册一个 Handshake 域名，任何人都可以提出一个网站名称，并在 Handshake 的市场上用其同名 HNS token 对该网站进行竞标。
据外媒 CoinDesk 统计，目前共有 6818 个 Handshake 域名处于活跃使用状态，已注册的域名达到了 375000 个。
数据显示，其市场交易量每月平均增长 60%，近期将突破 14 万美元。
像 Handshake 这样的分布式（decentralized）域名系统，可能会成为分布式网络的标志性胜利。
该项目是众多所谓「Web 3.0」应用程序的一部分，当然，「Web 3.0」这个概念还存在很多争议，比如创建某些未经审查的互联网搜索，是否会带来更多的隐患？正如 Sci-Hub 的经历所证明的问题一样，分布式的网络是出于去平台化的担忧而构建的。
随着互联网访问接入点越来越集中在「少数玩家」的手上，最近也有一些应用受到了 Web 服务器提供、应用商店和 DNS 证书颁发机构的审查。

Only in Windows NT and Windows 2000 was there a difference in the <strong>net </strong>command and the <strong>net1</strong> command. The net1 command was made available in these two operating systems as a temporary fix for a Y2K problem that affected the <strong>net </strong>command.
<h2>  Net Command Examples  </h2>
net view
This is one of the simplest net commands that lists all the networked devices.
net share Downloads=Z:\Downloads&nbsp;/GRANT:everyone,FULL
In the above example, I'm sharing the&nbsp;<em>Z:\Downloads</em>&nbsp;folder with&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;on the network and giving all of them&nbsp;full&nbsp;read/write access. You could modify this one by replacing&nbsp;<em>FULL</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>READ</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>CHANGE</em>&nbsp;for those rights only, as well as replace&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;with a specific username to give share access to just that one user account.
net accounts /MAXPWAGE:180
This example of the net accounts command forces a user's password to expire after 180 days. This number can be anywhere from&nbsp;<em>1</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>49,710</em>, or <em>UNLIMITED</em>&nbsp;can be used so that the password never expires. Default is 90 days.
net stop&nbsp;"print spooler"
The above net command example is how you'd stop the Print Spooler service from the command line.&nbsp;Services can also be started, stopped, and restarted via the Services graphical tool in Windows (services.msc), but using the net stop command lets you control them from places like Command Prompt and <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/bat-file-2619796" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">BAT&nbsp;files</a>.

net start
Executing the net start command without any options following it (e.g. net start "print spooler")&nbsp;is useful if you want to see a list of currently running services. This list can be helpful when managing services because you don't have to leave the command line to see which services are running.

<h2>send a pop up message to another computer</h2>
<h3>Send a Message to Another PC on a Local Network</h3>
run cmd
type <b>Net send</b> followed by the name of the computer to which you wish to send the message. Next, enter the message.

msg /SERVER:DestinationPC * /TIME:60 “This is the message to be sent to a PC named DestinationPC and closes in 60 seconds."

You will need to replace DestinationPC with the name of the desired PC (you can find this in the list of computers that are currently sharing your network, if you don't already know the PC name).
Now, replace the value for TIME with how long you want the message to appear on the other screen for. For example TIME:30 for 30seconds
Then replace the text between the quotation marks with the message that you want to send.
Finally, you can hit enter, and the message will be sent.

<h3>to list all computers in a windows wi-fi network</h3>
run cmd
<b>net view</b> will probably show most of them.

Ping the server if you know or your gateway.
Type the command <b>arp -a</b>
It will usually list down all the IP's and Computers with their Mac Addresses.

If you want to use a GUI tool. I recommend <b>IPScan</b>.
Although it is a light application (433KB), it is freeware that's always worked for me.
You can also use another GUI Tool, Advance IP Scanner.

<h3>how do I send a pop up message</h3>
To send a popup message:
Select one or more users from the user list.
Issue the Send popup message command by right-clicking on any selected user and selecting the 'Popup Message' menu item.

The 'Send popup message' window will appear.
Enter message text and click on the 'Send' button.

<h3>can I send a message to an IP address? </h3>
The IP Message no longer works.
The idea behind it is that you type a message and sort of password protect using some IP address.
Only the person with that IP address will be able to see the message.

Likewise, people ask, how can I see messages from another computer using CMD?
Start command prompt
Type the command as follows:
Hit enter and voila, the message is sent.
How can I communicate with another computer on the same network?

Method 1 Sharing Internet from Windows

Connect the two computers with an Ethernet cable.
Open Start.
Open Control Panel.
Click Network and Internet.
Click Network and Sharing Center.
Click Change adapter settings.
Select both the Wi-Fi connection and the Ethernet connection.
Right-click the Wi-Fi connection.

Alternatives for Older Versions of Windows
Alternative 1
Here is the first alternative way of sending messages that may work if you have an older version of Windows. Here's how:

Click Start > Run.
Type cmd, and press Enter.
In the window that opens, type Net send followed by the name of the computer to which you wish to send the message.
Next, enter the message. For example, the format should resemble "Net send PC01 can you read this message?"
Alternative 2
It is easy to send messages through cmd prompt to other systems here is the answer first we have to set our systems messenger ACTIVE. For it, follow these steps:

1. Go to RUN
2. Type services.msc
3. Scroll down and right click on MESSENGER
4. Select PROPERTIES
5. Then for enabling it go to STARTUP TYPE and select AUTOMATIC
6. Then OK
And this should be performed on both sides (SENDER & RECEIVER). After that if you want to send message then do the following steps:

1. Go to cmd prompt
2. Type syntax as follows: net send <ipaddress of reciever> <message to be send>
Ex:

net send 172.16.6.99 "hello"

When it comes to network storage, I'd recommend a <a href="https://dongknows.com/dong-ngos-most-important-gadget-is-a-synology-nas-server/#Whats_a_NAS_server" target="_blank">NAS server</a>. 
But a good server can be expensive; plus, not everyone wants or has time to configure all the features. 
So the second-best option is to make use of what you likely already have: the Wi-Fi router USB port.

Indeed, there are many routers on the market that can simultaneously deliver both Wi-Fi <em>and</em> storage space for your entire home. 
Specifically, they allow you to share files stored on an external drive with the rest of the network.
This post, among other things, talks about the storage-related use of a USB-ready Wi-Fi router. 
You'll also find the link to my list of recommended routers and tips on how to best set up one as a NAS server.

<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Asus-RT-AX89X-USB-768x1024.jpg" src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Asus-RT-AX89X-USB-768x1024.jpg" data-was-processed="true">
Router USB port: These little ports can bring about extra values.

<h3 id="routertopic-1">What's the use of a Wi-Fi router USB port?</h3>
Not every Wi-Fi router has a USB port, but if yours happens to have one, chances are you can use it for (at least one of) the followings:
<h3 id="routertopic-2">Host that (old) printer</h3>

Print serving is the original function of a router USB port. 
Connect a USB printer to this port, and it's now available to the entire network. 
There's no need to buy a printer for each person anymore.
Five or six years ago, this feature was a big deal since printers at the time were mostly USB-only. 

Nowadays, those with a built-in network port or Wi-Fi are commonplace. 
With that, some new Wi-Fi routers don't offer the print serving feature anymore, though many still do.
<h3 id="routertopic-3">Cellular connection</h3>
This feature allows the router to host a cellular USB modem and share the mobile Internet to the entire network. 

A cellular connection is a great way to have a backup Internet when your broadband service, like DSL or cable, is down.
Note that a router with this feature only supports specific cellular modems. 
Make sure you check the manual to know which one to get.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Wi-Fi-Router-USB-NAS.jpg">

Picking the right external storage device is the first step to turn a Wi-Fi router USB port into a mini NAS server.
<h3 id="routertopic-4">Network-attached storage (NAS) server</h3>
This feature is, by far, the most common and useful. 
Similar to the case of printing, plugging an external hard drive into the router USB port can also make its storage available to the entire network.

On top of that, you can use that public storage space for other applications, such as a backup destination (including Time Machine backup, in some cases,) PC-less downloading, or even a personal cloud.<a href="https://dongknows.com/how-to-turn-your-wi-fi-router-into-a-time-capsule/">See also How to Turn your USB-enabled Wi-Fi Router into a Time Capsule</a>
<h3 id="routertopic-5">How to best turn a Wi-Fi router USB port into a NAS server</h3>
There are a couple of things to keep in mind about using a router as a NAS server.
<h3 id="routertopic-6">Get expectations straight</h3>

The first and most important thing to remember is a router's primary function is to host your network. 
For this reason, even a high-end router tends to have limited processing power for non-networking tasks. 
<h4>It's a router you're using!</h4>
Naturally, a router is not as capable as a dedicated NAS server when hosting storage space. 

Also, just because the router USB port or ports support a few functions -- like NAS, printing, or cellular modem, and so on -- doesn't mean you should expect to use <em>all of them at the same time</em>, nor should you expect the top performance of each when you use them all together. 
(For the same reason, you can't, either, expect to have the same storage performance via Wi-Fi as via a wired connection. 
In the former, the router has to use its power to broadcast the Wi-Fi signals at the same time.)
By the way, if a router has multiple USB ports, chances are they all share a single USB hub. 

So, you can't use more than one bus-powered devices with it, and each port only has its share of the hub's total bandwidth.
Again, it's a router you're looking at. 
Just because there are ports doesn't mean you can use them all at your expected performance.
<h4>Security</h4>

Security can also be a concern. 
For example, some routers still use <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block#SMB_/_CIFS_/_SMB1" target="_blank">SMBv1</a>, which is the original and ancient version of the popular Server Message Block protocol used in the Windows environment for network file and printer sharing. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SMBv1-required.png">
Router USB port: Some routers still require the old and vulnerable SMBv1 protocol for the USB-based file sharing.

Due to security holes, for about a decade now, SMBv1 has been replaced by SMBv2 and newer versions and recently even disabled by default in most modern operating systems. 
That doesn't mean using SMBv1 will get you in trouble immediately, but it sure is not ideal. 
(Note, though, that many Asus routers might have the warning about enabling SMBv1, but they don't require it to work. 
In my experience, all Asus Wi-Fi 6 routers can work with newer SMB versions.)

Another security concern is when you use the NAS feature via the Internet. 
In this case, make sure you create an account for each user access. 
But if you're not sure, just don't turn on any “cloud” feature or FTP access. 
Use those only when you know what you're doing.

The bottom line is, if you want to do a lot of things with your network storage, it's a good idea to get a real dedicated <a href="https://dongknows.com/dong-ngos-most-important-gadget-is-a-synology-nas-server/" target="_blank">NAS server</a>. 
But if you only wish to use some casual network storage, it's quite fun and sensible to get even more use out of our router.
<h3 id="routertopic-7">Get a good external drive</h3>
Any good external storage device, namely desktop or laptop (portable) USB drives, will work. 

You don't need to get a NAS-specific drive. 
So, if you want the fastest possible speed, get a fast SSD-based portable drive, such as one of those on this list. 
However, keep in mind that the performance depends on the network connection or the router's processing power.
That said, a fast external storage device doesn't always translate into better performance. 

In most cases, an affordable hard-drive-based portable drive, like the <a href="https://dongknows.com/wd-my-passport-2019-portable-drive-review/" class="rank-math-link">WD My Passport</a> or the <a href="https://dongknows.com/g-tech-g-drive-mobile-usb-c-review/" class="rank-math-link">G-Tech Mobile</a>, will do. 
Generally, a router USB port has enough juice to power one bus-powered drive. 
But you can also use desktop external drives that have a power adapter of their own. 
In this case, you can use one with each of a router's USB ports.

<a href="https://dongknows.com/best-portable-drives/">See also Best Portable Drives of 2021: The Ultra-secure, Extra-rugged, and Super-fast</a>
When it comes to storage space, the more, the better, so get the drive with the most capacity you can afford. 
If you're serious about your data, you can also choose an external drive with <a href="https://dongknows.com/why-you-would-want-a-synology-nas-server/#Redundancy_via_the_use_of_RAID_explained" target="_blank">redundancy</a>, such as a dual-drive RAID 1 external storage device, like the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2lpFRrN" target="_blank">WD My Book Duo</a>.
<strong>Note: </strong>You will need to configure the hardware RAID setup <em>before</em> plugging it into the router. 

So do that on a computer first. 
<h3 id="routertopic-8">Get the right router</h3>
Not all routers are equal, especially when it comes to raw power. 
That said, get a router that has a lot of processing power. 

Generally, the higher the specs, the better.<a href="https://dongknows.com/usb-c-vs-thunderbolt-3-explained/">See also Device Connections Explained: Thunderbolt or Not, It's All about USB-C</a>
Also, make sure you get a router that supports <a href="https://dongknows.com/peripheral-connection-explained-usb-c-vs-thunderbolt-3/" target="_blank">USB 3.2 Gen 1</a>, a.k.a USB 3.0, or faster. 
Some router also has an eSATA or USB-C port. 
So, find one that suits your needs. 

And finally, get the router that includes the storage features you want, such as the <a href="https://dongknows.com/how-to-turn-your-wi-fi-router-into-a-time-capsule/" target="_blank">support for Time Machine backup</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Asus-RT-AX88U-USB-mode-1024x858.png">
Router USB port: Steps to make an Asus Wi-Fi router USB port work in USB 3.0 (a.k.a USB 3.2 Gen 1) mode.
<h3 id="routertopic-9">Use the correct settings</h3>

By default, many routers -- especially those from Asus and Synology -- automatically set the connected drive to work in USB 2.0 mode. 
This mode won't affect the router's NAS functionality but has a theoretical cap speed of just 480 Mbps (60 MB/s) -- the real-world rate will be just about half of that. 
The USB 3.2 Gen 1 (formerly USB 3.0) mode, which the cap of 5 Gbps (625 MB/s), unfortunately, can adversely affect the router's 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band. 
That said, if you want to get the most out of the router's storage feature, you'll need to enable the faster USB mode manually -- we use mostly the 5GHz band these days anyway.

Also, make sure you use the external drive with the right setting. 
For one, use it in the <a href="https://dongknows.com/file-system-explained-and-how-to-format-your-drive/" target="_blank">correct file system</a> that the router supports. 
Most, if not all routers, support NTFS. 
<a href="https://dongknows.com/disk-partition-and-file-system-explained/">See also File System and Partition Explained: Take Control of Your Storage</a>

By the way, it's worth noting that you only need to use the file system that the router supports, and not the one your computer supports. 
That's because the file system used by the server has nothing to do with the client. 
So, for example, if you use an NTFS (Windows) external drive with your router and share its storage, over the network, your Mac will be able to read, write to the shared folder, and use the space for Time Machine backup (if supported) just fine. 
Finally, don't turn on the external storage device's security feature if it has one. 

A router has no mechanism to unlock it.
<h3 id="routertopic-10">How to access your router-based NAS server</h3>
Once you've connected a storage device to a router and turned on the data sharing feature -- often referred to as Windows-based, or SAMBA (SMB), file sharing -- it's easy to access that share space from any computer within the network. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asus-RT-AX92U-USB-Features-836x1024.jpg">

The USB-related features of an Asus router. 
For NAS, the Samba option is in the second (Servers Center) from top.
A couple of things to note here:
<ul><li>Depending on the router, there might be more features than just data sharing. 

Another popular option is the media server -- where the router shares video and audio files stored on the connected drive via media streaming protocol. 
In this case, just follow the instruction to turn the desired feature on.</li><li>Here I assume you know how to set up a router, access its web interface, etc -- enabling the NAS feature is part of working with the router's interface. 
If not, this <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dongknows.com/home-wi-fi-router-setup/" target="_blank">post on how to build a network from scratch</a> will help you with that.</li></ul>
But data sharing is the most useful and popular, and I'll cover it here. 

It's fairly easy. 
To make it work, the only next thing you need is the router's IP address, which is the same one you've used to access its interface. 
Alternatively, you can also use the router's network name. 
But the IP is always the <em>sure</em> way. 

For this post, let's say the IP address in question is <em>192.168.1.1</em>. 
(Chances are yours is a different one. 
If you don't know what it is, this post on IP addresses includes detailed steps to figure that out.)
Once you've got the IP address, the steps below are the standard ways to access your newly-minted NAS server from a Windows or Mac computer within your local network hosted by the router.

<h3 id="routertopic-11">Accessing your NAS server on a Windows computer</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Access-Server-Windows.png">
You can access the shared folder via the router's IP address.
1. 

Open Explorer.
2. 
On the address bar type in this command then press Enter:
<strong><em>\\192.168.1.1</em></strong>

(Alternatively, you can also use <strong>\\RouterName</strong> and the Windows search field under the Start Menu instead of Explorer. 
Don't forget the \\ (<strong>not</strong> //) and remember there's no space in the command.)
3. 
Enter the username and password if prompted. 

If you haven't set up an account for the data sharing, or if the router doesn't support that, you can just use the<em> admin username and password of the router</em>‘s web interface.
<h3 id="routertopic-12">Accessing your NAS server on a Mac</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dongknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Access-Server-Mac-1024x768.jpg">
1. 

Click on an empty spot on the desktop then press&nbsp;<em>Command + K</em>, and the “Connect to Server” window will appear.
2. 
Under <em>Server address</em>&nbsp;type in
<strong><em> smb://192.168.1.1&nbsp;</em></strong>

(Again, you can also substitute the IP address with the router's network name.)
3. 
Click on <em>Connect</em> and enter username and password (of the account you've created or the router's admin account) if prompted.
And that's it. 

Happy data sharing!
