<h2>5 Tools to Manage Multiple Network Connection Profiles</h2>
Every home or work network you connect to can conceivably have different settings for the connection. 
At home you might <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/how-do-i-know-if-someone-is-using-my-wireless-network-wifi/">use a WiFi connection</a> with default or automatic settings, for work you might have a manually set IP address and gateway or <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/test-change-dns-servers-quickly-dns-jumper/">custom DNS servers</a>. 
Each different network configuration you come across requires the settings in Windows to be adjusted to match. 
While this isn&#8217;t a major problem because Windows allows you to change these types of settings, it isn&#8217;t the quickest thing to get at and change regularly.
Manual reconfiguration each time through <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/repair-xp-and-vista-internet-connection-problems-with-icr/">Windows Network Connections</a> is both time consuming and inefficient. 
It requires you to remember each individual setting or the network might not connect properly. 
An easy solution is being able to create different network profiles for different scenarios, so you can save <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/6-free-websites-to-map-ip-addresses-to-geographical-locations/">IP address</a>, DNS, default gateway and other settings for each network connection you encounter. 
When you need to change to a different network, a different profile can easily be applied which changes all the required settings automatically.
Here are 5 free tools for you to create and apply network profiles.

<h3>1. TCP/IP Manager</h3>
TCP/IP Manager has a good mix of the ability to easily save network settings into a series of profiles and enough features and functions to cater for most users. 
The program is open source and available in both setup installer and portable versions. 
Make sure to get the correct 32-bit or 64-bit version for your system.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tcpip_manager.png">

After launching the program click Create a new profile and give it a name. 
Choose a network adapter from the drop down and configure the IP address, subnet, gateway and DNS servers. 
Automatic options are also available like in Windows. 
Optionally go to the Profile settings tab and choose to show the profile in the tray menu and give it a keyboard shortcut so you can launch the profile by a key combination. 
Finally click Save current profile. 
When you want to launch a profile click Apply in the window, press the hotkey combination or select from the tray icon context menu.
Proxy servers can be configured from the corresponding tab, advanced settings include changing the computer name, changing the workgroup name and possibly a unique feature of allowing MAC spoofing on the network adapter. 
TCP/IP Manager was quite reasonable on memory usage consuming around 4MB while sitting in the tray.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/2089/" rel="nofollow">Download TCP/IP Manager</a>

<h3>2. IP Shifter</h3>
If you just want a nice and simple network connection changer, IP Shifter is relatively easy to use and doesn&#8217;t require tons of knowledge to configure. 
It also has a portable version so installation isn&#8217;t necessary either.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ip_shifter.png">

Start the program, click the button to create a new profile and give it a name. 
The standard options allow you to select the network adapter from the drop down and then obtain an automatic or manual IP address and DNS server. 
This window is similar to the Windows Internet Protocol 4 Properties dialog and has boxes for IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS servers. 
Proxies for Internet Explorer and Firefox can be setup by clicking on Settings and the check box near the bottom.
Once all the profiles are setup you can switch between them by selecting and clicking Apply in the main window or minimize the program to the tray and right click on the tray icon. 
IP Shifter used around 3MB of memory while in the tray. 
A couple of useful extras are in the Tools menu to Ping an address, scan the LAN for computers and obtain your public IP address.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3631/" rel="nofollow">Download IP Shifter</a>

<h3>3. NetSetMan</h3>
In contrast to IP Shifter, NetSetMan is loaded with tons of options and may be a bit too much for the average user. 
For geeks and advanced users though, it&#8217;s one of the most feature rich network profiling tools around. 
Only a setup installer is available but it can create a portable version because the program can be extracted to the folder of your choice.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/netsetman.png">

Most of the settings can be left alone if you only want a simple IP and DNS changer. 
Choose a renamable SET tab to edit the profile and enter enter the IP, gateway and DNS information or leave what you don&#8217;t need on automatic. 
Use the Activate button or the tray context menu to choose between them. 
The IP+ button takes you to an advanced settings window where extra functions such as routing tables, DNS suffixes and expert settings like running Windows ipconfig commands are available.
Other more advanced networking options like a built in WiFi connection manager, computer name and workgroup changer, create network drives, append to the HOSTS file and a dedicated IPv6 settings window could all prove useful. 
Other options like changing the default printer, changing dozens of system settings or running a script/program are nice additions but not strictly necessary. 
NetSetMan uses around 8MB of memory in the background. 
The free personal use only version cannot change proxies, browser home pages and network domains.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3632/" rel="nofollow">Download NetSetMan</a>

<h3>4. Net Profiles Mod</h3>
This is a modified and forked version of the discontinued Net Profiles tool which has not been updated since 2011. 
Luckily this open source modded version is still in active development so there&#8217;s a fair chance bugs and issues will be fixed in future.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/net_profiles_mod.png">

Setting up a new profile is easy and for basic usage you only have to give it a name, select a network (if there are multiple) and enter the IP and DNS details manually if required. 
Use the Get Current Settings button to create a profile of your current network configuration. 
Additional options include proxies, default browser homepage, mapped drives, default printer, running an application, desktop resolution/wallpaper and connection to a specific SSID. 
File &gt; Create Desktop Shortcut allows launching a profile via shortcut without having the program running in the background.
There are a couple of issues we had with Net Profiles Mod. 
Firstly, our WiFi adapter was not recognized unless it was connected to a wireless network. 
Secondly, you cannot obtain an IP address automatically through DHCP and set the DNS servers manually, or vice versa. 
This is easily possible through Windows and a drawback if you want to change the DNS but leave the IP alone.

<h3>5. Argon Network Switcher</h3>
Argon Network Switcher is a middle of the road type of tool in terms of features. 
It has enough to satisfy all but the most advanced users but not too many to confuse people.
<img src="https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/argon_network_switcher.png">

Usage is similar to the other tools here. 
Click New to create a new profile, enter a name, select the network adapter and then enter the IP, subnet, gateway and DNS addresses. 
Click Save to add the profile. 
Additional options include assigning a specific WiFi SSID, proxy settings, map a drive, set the default printer, start and stop system services, run scripts and applications and also disabling a specific network adapter on running the profile. 
An interesting feature is Autorun which leaves it up to the program to determine the best profile to launch.
We did notice a couple of bugs during usage. 
One was the WiFi SSID profiles are not displayed for everyone so you can&#8217;t associate a wireless SSID with the network profile. 
Another was using the Test button in the Drive Map tab freezes the program. 
However, mounting and unmounting networked drives does work fine. 
Network Switcher consumes about 10-15MB of RAM when minimized to the tray.
<a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3634/" rel="nofollow">Download Argon Network Switcher</a>
<em>Final Note: </em>We did also look at a few other network connection profiling tools, one we almost included was <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3635/" rel="nofollow">Eusing Free IP Switcher</a>. 
This tool is like an easier to use version of NetSetMan but a major issue is a donate popup nag every time the program launches. 
This is a shame as it has a good blend of ease of use and features to make it useful.

<h2>Accessing WAMP From Computers on Your LAN</h2>
<a href="https://john-dugan.com/access-wamp-from-lan-computers/" class="whitebut ">Accessing WAMP From Computers on Your LAN</a>

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24005828/how-to-enable-local-network-users-to-access-my-wamp-sites" class="whitebut ">enable local network users to access my WAMP sites</a>

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36810669/why-wamp-server-put-online-offline-option-is-missing/36825283" class="whitebut ">wamp server put online/ offline</a>

Right click Wampmanager -> WAMPSetting -> Menu Item: Online/Offline

If you click it so there is a Tick beside it, you will see the Online/Offline menu on the left click menu.

However it was made optional as its use is defunct.

You should create Virtual Hosts for each of your projects, then you can amend each of those individually to control the Apache access rules.

In fact in WAMPServer 3 or greater, there is a Virtual Host defined for localhost so this old Online/Offline process wont actually do what you want.

You now have to go to the wamp\bin\apache\apache{version}\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf file and manually amend that entry

&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www
    &lt;Directory  "D:/wamp/www/">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted                  #&lt;-- changed line
    &lt;/Directory>
&lt;/VirtualHost>

This file can be edited using the wampmanager menus like this
wampmanager -> Apache -> httpd-vhosts.conf

However it is not recommended to allow this sort of access to localhost. It is better to create a Virtual Hosts for each of your projects eg

&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www
    &lt;Directory  "D:/wamp/www/">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require local
    &lt;/Directory>
&lt;/VirtualHost>

&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName project1.dev
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www/project1
    &lt;Directory  "D:/wamp/www/project1">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory>
&lt;/VirtualHost>

<h2>Sci-Hub 用上了分布式网络</h2>
在网站域名屡次被撤销之后， Sci-Hub 创始人 Alexandra Elbakyan 在分布式域名网络 Handshake 上注册了新的网站。

现在，每个用户都可以直接通过服务门户和 NextDNS 直接访问 Sci-Hub。

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/KmXPKA19gW9mkBqdBCp94269UtFWSXwVKf5bzAj8gh8YzGa7V5KvCricAp7ViaI0O9qrEv3Q8s5YrVOHiafdAdHKQ/640">

NextDNS：https://learn.namebase.io/starting-from-zero/how-to-access-handshake-sites#level-3-dns
HNS 网关 http://sci-hub.hns.hns.to/
这些年来，一直是 Alexandra Elbakyan 在维护 Sci-Hub，目前所有用户只能通过俄罗斯的 Yandex 和比特币赞助网站的运营。

此前，Sci-Hub 被多次撤销域名，推特账户又被封禁且无法申诉，传统域名系统显然不那么满足这个「盗版学术论文数据库」的需求，能够对抗审查的 DNS 成为 Sci-Hub 保持可访问状态的方法之一。
Handshake 工作原理Tieshun Roquerre 介绍说，Handshake 实际上是一个分布式的域名服务器。
它不使用 web 标准证书颁发机构来验证用户与服务器的连接，而是存储对在其系统中注册的网站的 IP 地址的引用。
这样一来，如果证书颁发机构公司试图通过旧版系统审查 Sci-Hub 的域名，那么想要访问网站的人仍然可以通过 Handshake 的记录访问。
Namebase 则是为用户提供访问 Handshake 网络的平台，这个名字对于国内开发者来说不算陌生。

去年，关于「Namebase 羊毛现金福利」的消息一度引起热议，「满足条件的 GitHub 开发者可以获得大约 4200 个 HNS 代币的奖励」，折合人民币 5000 元左右，还有成功领取者写出了「从天上接馅饼」的教程。
Namebase CEO Tieshun Roquerre 介绍说：「DNS 就像互联网的电话簿，电话簿中的地址是服务器 IP 地址。
DNS 的创建是为了给 IP 地址提供人类可读的名称，因此在这一平台上，用户可以通过 Handshake 找到 IP 地址，而不是通过证书颁发机构。
」Roquerre 提到：「如果你的服务器级别受到限制，则可以切换服务器。
但如果你的域名被删除，就没人能访问你的网站了。

只要名称完好无损，就可以将其指向任何服务器。
」即使 band 网站找到了一个新域名，但用户也不确定其真实性（例如 Sci-Hub 也经常被冒名顶替）。
要注册一个 Handshake 域名，任何人都可以提出一个网站名称，并在 Handshake 的市场上用其同名 HNS token 对该网站进行竞标。
据外媒 CoinDesk 统计，目前共有 6818 个 Handshake 域名处于活跃使用状态，已注册的域名达到了 375000 个。
数据显示，其市场交易量每月平均增长 60%，近期将突破 14 万美元。
像 Handshake 这样的分布式（decentralized）域名系统，可能会成为分布式网络的标志性胜利。
该项目是众多所谓「Web 3.0」应用程序的一部分，当然，「Web 3.0」这个概念还存在很多争议，比如创建某些未经审查的互联网搜索，是否会带来更多的隐患？正如 Sci-Hub 的经历所证明的问题一样，分布式的网络是出于去平台化的担忧而构建的。
随着互联网访问接入点越来越集中在「少数玩家」的手上，最近也有一些应用受到了 Web 服务器提供、应用商店和 DNS 证书颁发机构的审查。

Only in Windows NT and Windows 2000 was there a difference in the <strong>net </strong>command and the <strong>net1</strong> command. The net1 command was made available in these two operating systems as a temporary fix for a Y2K problem that affected the <strong>net </strong>command.
<h2>  Net Command Examples  </h2>
net view
This is one of the simplest net commands that lists all the networked devices.
net share Downloads=Z:\Downloads&nbsp;/GRANT:everyone,FULL
In the above example, I'm sharing the&nbsp;<em>Z:\Downloads</em>&nbsp;folder with&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;on the network and giving all of them&nbsp;full&nbsp;read/write access. You could modify this one by replacing&nbsp;<em>FULL</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>READ</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>CHANGE</em>&nbsp;for those rights only, as well as replace&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;with a specific username to give share access to just that one user account.
net accounts /MAXPWAGE:180
This example of the net accounts command forces a user's password to expire after 180 days. This number can be anywhere from&nbsp;<em>1</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>49,710</em>, or <em>UNLIMITED</em>&nbsp;can be used so that the password never expires. Default is 90 days.
net stop&nbsp;"print spooler"
The above net command example is how you'd stop the Print Spooler service from the command line.&nbsp;Services can also be started, stopped, and restarted via the Services graphical tool in Windows (services.msc), but using the net stop command lets you control them from places like Command Prompt and <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/bat-file-2619796" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">BAT&nbsp;files</a>.

net start
Executing the net start command without any options following it (e.g. net start "print spooler")&nbsp;is useful if you want to see a list of currently running services. This list can be helpful when managing services because you don't have to leave the command line to see which services are running.

<h2>send a pop up message to another computer</h2>
<h3>Send a Message to Another PC on a Local Network</h3>
run cmd
type <b>Net send</b> followed by the name of the computer to which you wish to send the message. Next, enter the message.

msg /SERVER:DestinationPC * /TIME:60 “This is the message to be sent to a PC named DestinationPC and closes in 60 seconds."

You will need to replace DestinationPC with the name of the desired PC (you can find this in the list of computers that are currently sharing your network, if you don't already know the PC name).
Now, replace the value for TIME with how long you want the message to appear on the other screen for. For example TIME:30 for 30seconds
Then replace the text between the quotation marks with the message that you want to send.
Finally, you can hit enter, and the message will be sent.

<h3>to list all computers in a windows wi-fi network</h3>
run cmd
<b>net view</b> will probably show most of them.

Ping the server if you know or your gateway.
Type the command <b>arp -a</b>
It will usually list down all the IP's and Computers with their Mac Addresses.

If you want to use a GUI tool. I recommend <b>IPScan</b>.

You can also use another GUI Tool, Advance IP Scanner.

<h3>how do I send a pop up message</h3>
To send a popup message:
Select one or more users from the user list.
Issue the Send popup message command by right-clicking on any selected user and selecting the 'Popup Message' menu item.

The 'Send popup message' window will appear.
Enter message text and click on the 'Send' button.

<h3>can I send a message to an IP address? </h3>
The IP Message no longer works.
The idea behind it is that you type a message and sort of password protect using some IP address.
Only the person with that IP address will be able to see the message.

Likewise, people ask, how can I see messages from another computer using CMD?
Start command prompt
Type the command as follows:
Hit enter and voila, the message is sent.
How can I communicate with another computer on the same network?

Alternative 1
Here is the first alternative way of sending messages that may work if you have an older version of Windows. Here's how:

Click Start > Run.
Type cmd, and press Enter.
In the window that opens, type Net send followed by the name of the computer to which you wish to send the message.
Next, enter the message. For example, the format should resemble "Net send PC01 can you read this message?"
Alternative 2

2. Type services.msc
3. Scroll down and right click on MESSENGER
4. Select PROPERTIES
5. Then for enabling it go to STARTUP TYPE and select AUTOMATIC

And this should be performed on both sides (SENDER & RECEIVER). After that if you want to send message then do the following steps:

1. Go to cmd prompt
2. Type syntax as follows: net send <ipaddress of reciever> <message to be send>
Ex:
