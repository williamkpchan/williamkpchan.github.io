Preparing a meal and eating together is a wonderful way to spend time with family and friends. 
While doing this activity not only can you share foods you love but it is also a good opportunity to talk and learn about one another. 
In this lesson, we will be covering everything you need to know from coming up with a meal to prepare, cooking it together, and sharing a conversation.

<b>Invitation and Planning</b>

First you must choose a meal to share. 
Breakfast is eaten in the morning, lunch in the afternoon and dinner in the evening. 
The steps for planning a menu are relatively the same for all three. 
When planning a meal it is also important to try and come up with something you all will enjoy. 


Here are some questions commonly used when asking someone to cook a meal and have dinner.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S1.mp3">Would you like to come over to my house and have dinner with me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S2.mp3">Maybe we could cook dinner together?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S3.mp3">What time should we plan on getting together?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S4.mp3">Do you have any suggestions on what we could make?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S10.mp3">Maybe we can split the grocery bill?</a>"

<h2>Grocery Shopping</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/203-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Grocery shopping is something commonly done when replacing or refilling things needed around the house. 
The steps involved include figuring out what you need and making a list, making a decision on when and where to go, and then the actual process of shopping at the grocery store. 
Below we will look at each section and the questions/answers associated with each.

<b>Preparation</b>

Preparation is the time for decision making. 
You will need to decide on making a list of what to buy, where to take coupons and the possibility of planning meals just to name a few.

Here are some questions commonly used when preparing to grocery shop.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S1.mp3">Should we make a list first before we go?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S2.mp3">Should we check the newspaper for coupons?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S3.mp3">Should we plan out our meals for the week?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S4.mp3">Should we check in the fridge for anything that has expired?</a>"

If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S5.mp3">Yes, I think making a list would save us time once we are there.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S6.mp3">I have been making a list this week as I noticed we needed things. 
Take a look and see if anything needs to be added.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S7.mp3">I will get Sunday's newspaper to look for coupons.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S8.mp3">That's ok. 
They usually have coupons at the store we can use.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S9.mp3">I think planning our meals would be smart. 
That way we know exactly what we need.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S10.mp3">I don't think we need to plan our meals. 
Let's just make a list of things we need and we can cook whatever we have.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S11.mp3">Yes we should check the dates on what we have. 
That way if anything is expired we can replace it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P203/sentence/P203S12.mp3">I think most of what we have is ok. 
We don't need to check the expiration dates.</a>"

<h2>Planning</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/204-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Some of the important decisions in the planning process are where to go, when would be a good time to go, and who is going to go.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S1.mp3">Should we go to Costco for some of the bigger items we need?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S2.mp3">Should we go at a certain time so it's not so crowded?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S3.mp3">Should we go to the fresh market or to our regular supermarket?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S4.mp3">Should we both go and take the kids or one of us stay home with them?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S5.mp3">Should we take our own grocery bags?</a>"

If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S6.mp3">Let's go to Costco some other day, it will take too long.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S7.mp3">Sure, I think we can find most of what we need there.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S8.mp3">I like to go to the grocery at night. 
There always seems to be less people.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S9.mp3">I prefer to go in the morning so I can get it over with.</a>" 

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S10.mp3">I think we should go to both. 
We can get the vegetables and fruits we need at the fresh market.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S11.mp3">Let's just go to the regular grocery. 
We do not have time for both.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S12.mp3">If we go to Fred Meyer the kids can go into the kids play area. 
That way we can shop without any distractions.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S13.mp3">It might be too much to take the whole family. 
I can just go if you do not mind staying home with the kids?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S14.mp3">I think we should take our own recyclable bags. 
It's good for the earth!</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P204/sentence/P204S15.mp3">We can just use what they have there.</a>"

<b>Choosing a Pet</b>

Choosing the right pet is one of the most important steps in becoming a pet owner. 
There are a lot needs to be considered when taking into account the time, money and effort a pet can require. 
Where you live, are you active, are you gone a lot, any medical issues and do you have a family? All of these questions and more should be discussed when thinking of buying a new pet. 
When looking for a pet you may also consider visiting a shelter. 
Many animals at a shelter need a good home and most likely will already have their vaccines and be spayed or neutered. 
A shelter is a good place where stray or homeless animals are taken in order to try and find them suitable homes.

Here are some questions commonly used when discussing what kind of pet to consider.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S1.mp3">Do you like cats or dogs?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S2.mp3">Do we have time for training?</a>"

Being knowledgeable and being able to ask the right questions can help provide you with what you need to make the best decision.

Below we will look at the different types of child care as well as questions you might be asked as well as important questions you may want information on.

<b>In Home Child Care</b>

In home child care can include someone coming to your house and watching your child or you dropping your child off at someone else's house. 
This could be a family member or someone with a licensed in home daycare. 
Since having a family member watch your child can be easier to set up, we will look more at having a non family member come over or taking your child to an in house daycare.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P209/sentence/P209S13.mp3">What is your curriculum?</a>"

By asking these and other questions that may pertain to your individual circumstances you will learn a lot about whether or not this daycare will work for you.

Below are some questions that you might be asked when looking into an in house daycare.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P209/sentence/P209S14.mp3">Has your child ever been to a daycare before?</a>"

Providing good information about your child can help with the transition.

<b>Day Care Centers</b>

Day Care Centers are much like a school that a wide variety of children can attend. 
From babies to older children, daycares can vary in their prices, age ranges and curriculum. 
When making a decision on which Day Care Centers to use it is important to research them and what they have to offer. 
The questions listed for In-Home daycare are virtually the same for Day Care Centers as are the questions you might be asked. 
Just be prepared and make choices that you feel comfortable with.

<h2>Mail</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/213-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Mail basically is comprised of three components, the preparation, sending and receiving of mail. 
Sending mail can be as simple as putting addressed/stamped envelopes in your own mail box for your postman to pick up, to mailing packages or letters at the local post office or using one of the many delivery companies. 
Receiving mail/packages can also include delivery from your local postman as well as one of the many delivery companies.

<b>The Preparation</b>

Preparing mail/packages to be sent involves labeling with the recipient's name and address as well as the senders. 
Also making sure packages are sealed and wrapped to postal standards is a good idea. 
Make sure you are aware of postal laws regarding the types of materials that can be sent in the United States as well as other countries before mailing.

Here are some questions commonly used when discussing the preparation of letters and packages to send.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S1.mp3">Where do I put my name and address on the letter I am sending?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S2.mp3">How do I know if I need to put more than one stamp on the card I am sending?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S3.mp3">What should I put with the item I am shipping to make sure it does not break?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S4.mp3">How heavy can the objects be that I am sending?</a>"

Here are some possible answers to the question above regarding the preparation of letters/packages.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S5.mp3">You always put your name or the senders name and address in the top left corner of the package/letter. 
This is in case it cannot be delivered and needs to be returned to you. 
It will be returned to the address you have provided.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S6.mp3">I would either take the letter to the post office and ask them or look on the postal website to look at weight regulations when sending out letters.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S7.mp3">You can use newspaper or purchase packing material from the store to place in with what you are sending. 
You may also want to write on the outside of the package that what is inside is FRAGILE. 
This will inform whoever is handling it to be careful and handle gently.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P213/sentence/P213S8.mp3">You can send objects of various weights but you will be charged upon how much it weighs when shipping it. 
Meaning the more it weighs the more it will cost you to ship.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S2.mp3">If I am sending something breakable should I inform the post office?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S3.mp3">How fast will my letter/package get to the person I am sending it to?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S4.mp3">Why should I want to send a package through another company other than the post office?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S15.mp3">The post office can weigh the package for you and let you know how much it will cost to ship your item.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S16.mp3">I have a scale at home I use to weigh packages. 
Then I look online to see how much it will cost.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S17.mp3">I think it depends on the weight, take it to the post office.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S18.mp3">Just send it with one stamp. 
If it is too heavy they will send it back to you.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P214/sentence/P214S19.mp3">Yes, the post office can email you a confirmation of delivery.</a>"

I would look for one with a bigger keypad so it's easier to use.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S15.mp3">Applications are fun. 
Some phones have free ones and others you can buy.</a>"

I have one for music, one for games, and one I use as a GPS.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S17.mp3">Blue tooth is a wireless earpiece used for hands free talking.

If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P223/sentence/P223S8.mp3">You will need to call your local DMV to set up an appointment to take your test.</a>" DMV stands for Department of Motor Vehicles.

<b>Picking a school</b>

Depending on where you live you will most likely have a school assigned to you. 
The schools assigned to your area are public schools which offer grades kindergarten all the way up through high school. 
Public schools are free and are offered to all. 
A few other options available are private schools or even home schooling. 
Private schools usually require a tuition fee and vary in price and distance from where you live. 
Home schooling is where the parent(s) are the teachers at home educating and teaching their children. 
Children that are home schooled and decide to change to public or private schools usually will need to test into their appropriate grade.

<h2>Birthday</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/235-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Birthdays usually include a party or gathering to celebrate the life of the person whose birthday it is. 
Although having a party is not a necessity for birthdays, we will be going over the steps involved when deciding to have one.

<b>Planning and Invites</b>

The first thing you will want to do is plan a date to have the party. 
It does not need to be exactly on the date of the actual birth of the person the party is for. 
If the person's birthday falls on a Tuesday you can very well have the party on Saturday if it's more convenient. 
A birthday party can be a surprise, it can be at a special place, or it can happen simply at home. 
Coming up with a guest list and sending out invitations would be the next step. 
Below we will look at possible questions involved with the planning of a birthday party.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S1.mp3">My birthday this year is on a Monday. 
Should I have the party on a Saturday instead?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S2.mp3">Should we have a surprise birthday party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S3.mp3">Who do I invite?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S4.mp3">What's the best way to send out invitations?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S5.mp3">Should we have people RSVP? RSVP means 'Please respond.' You are asking people to let you know if they are attending beforehand so you can plan ahead.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S6.mp3">Should we reserve a room for the party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S7.mp3">Where should we get a cake?</a>"

If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S8.mp3">I would have the party on Saturday then more people might be able to come.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S9.mp3">It does not really matter, have it whenever you like.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S10.mp3">He does not like surprises so I would just do a regular party.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S12.mp3">I would just invite family since it's a small party.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S13.mp3">You could invite friends and family. 
Make it a big party this year.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S14.mp3">You could just pass out invites when you see the people.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S15.mp3">I would mail them since it is a surprise party.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S16.mp3">I would have people RSVP so you will know how many people are coming.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S18.mp3">I would reserve a room so no one else is using it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S20.mp3">We should get a cake at the bakery.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S21.mp3">We should get an ice cream cake from the ice cream store.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P236/sentence/P236S7.mp3">Yes if we get there early we can decorate and be done with it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P236/sentence/P236S8.mp3">Not really, we can decorate anytime.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P236/sentence/P236S9.mp3">Yes we should go out and buy lots of decorations.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P236/sentence/P236S10.mp3">We can just use stuff we have around here. 
We can just make a couple signs.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P236/sentence/P236S11.mp3">Having it catered would be great! Then we do not have to cook.</a>"

<h2>Vacations</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/238-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you have a job, vacations are a time spent away from it, or a vacation may just be time spent relaxing and taking a break from your daily responsibilities. 
Vacations can be as simple as staying home and relaxing with family to going on a trip somewhere to get away.

<b>Planning a Vacation</b>

Planning a vacation properly can make all the difference between having a fun, relaxing time to being stressed and not knowing what to do. 
If you decide to just stay home for a vacation then relaxing with family or friends might work just fine but if traveling, you may want to put in some research into what to do and when to do it. 
If visiting family or friends make sure they are able to take time away from their own jobs to spend quality time with you. 
If you are going to another state or country, checking travel requirements, weather, and accommodation will help make it a better experience. 
If you are employed it is a good idea to ask for the time off before scheduling anything. 
That way you can be sure of dates and times you will be gone.

Here are some questions commonly used when planning a vacation.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P238/sentence/P238S1.mp3">How far in advance should I ask for vacation time?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P238/sentence/P238S8.mp3">Should we go to an all-inclusive resort?</a>"

All-inclusive means you pay ahead of time for your rooms, food and beverages. 
Sometimes it helps to cut down on costs.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P238/sentence/P238S9.mp3">What if we do not speak the language of the place we are going to?</a>"

<b>Getting There</b>

Once you have scheduled a vacation and have decided to travel, you must now consider some sort of transportation. 
A lot depends on how far you are going, where you are going, and how fast you need to get there. 
Options might include traveling by airplane, car or even train. 
Checking prices, requirements for travel, and whether or not the mode of transportation goes to the destination are all the things to consider. 
If traveling by plane or train, make sure you book your seats months in advance if possible to assure a spot. 
A lot of times the price of traveling will change depending on your choice of seats and the time of year. 
So make sure you consider all when making reservations.

Expecting a baby can be both exciting and a nervous time. 
For first time parents you are deciding on a hospital for delivery, doctors for child care, deciding on birth classes, curious about what you are having, and preparation for home just to name a few. 
For second, third, or even forth time parent's things may be a bit easier and relaxed. 
We will be taking a look more at the experience or events of first time parents.

<b>Pregnancy</b>

Having a doctor you feel comfortable with and like will help make the pregnancy process a bit easier. 
The mother as well as the baby will be going through changes and having someone to answer all your questions will be helpful. 
You will need to go in for exams, have ultrasounds and continue to check the overall health of mom and the baby.

If you feel comfortable answering you can, but pregnancy is personal so it is ok to not answer questions especially asked by strangers.

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/245-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Neighbors are people who live in your neighborhood. 
You may live in a large neighborhood with lots of homes or a small cul de sac with just a few homes. 
Neighbors can even include people who live upstairs or downstairs from you in an apartment complex.

<b>Introductions</b>

Here are a few statements you can use when meeting a neighbor:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P245/sentence/P245S1.mp3">Hello, my name is Jack.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P245/sentence/P245S2.mp3">This is my wife, Suzie.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P245/sentence/P245S3.mp3">I live next door to you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P245/sentence/P245S4.mp3">I live downstairs from you.</a>"

These statements are all good ways of letting someone know something simple about you.

Here are some questions you can ask when speaking to a neighbor.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P245/sentence/P245S5.mp3">What is your name?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P245/sentence/P245S10.mp3">Hi, how are you doing?</a>"

You may be asked the same questions from a neighbor. 
If this happens, just answer them the best you can. 
These questions are a good way to initiate a conversation and a way to find out more about one another.

<b>Hanging out with Neighbors</b>

After meeting your neighbors you may want to spend more time with them. 
You can invite them over for a barbeque, for a drink, or even just hang out outside in the neighborhood. 
Just do the best you can talking and asking questions. 
Enjoy the time together to learn more about one another and have fun. 
Questions will come to you as you get to know them better and you will hopefully begin to feel more comfortable.

A daily planner will help you schedule your time wisely when dealing with a busy life full of events. 
Using a daily planner can help organize meetings, lunch plans and other responsibilities throughout your day. 
Daily planners come in all shapes and sizes. 
From writing things down to using an electronic planner, lots of options are available.

Here are some questions commonly used when using a daily planner.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P246/sentence/P246S4.mp3">How do I know what to use as a daily planner?</a>"

Monthly Planner/Yearly Planner

A monthly or yearly planner is essentially the same as a daily planner except the fact that they allow you to plan far in advance. 
Just as daily planners can be as simple as writing things down on a calendar or using an electronic device to keep track, the same methods can be applied on a monthly or yearly planner. 
Managing your time, making and keeping appointments, and keeping notified of special events are all functions of a planner.

Habits and heath are popular topics with almost everyone. 
From listening to the radio, watching T.V, or talking with friends, the topic of habits and health seem to always come up. 
Habits can include such things as smoking, drinking and eating and health topics can include dieting to exercising. 
Talking about these subjects with others depends on your comfort level or interest on the subjects. 
Often times these subjects come up because of curiosity or even by someone looking for other options. 
While information on these subjects is readily available for people to research on their own, it is important when talking about them to be caring and show respect while not telling someone what they SHOULD be doing but instead talk about your experience and thoughts while lending some support. 


<b>Habits</b>

The definition of a habit is an unconscious pattern of behavior that is acquired through frequent repetition. 
Although you hear a lot about 'bad' habits, not all are. 
You could have a habit of shaking hands when greeting someone or a habit of looking both ways before you cross the street for example.

So sending mail to another worker is a common practice. 
For example, if I need to send some financial documents to the auditor in a building down the street, I will use the Inter Office mail service. 
Some people might say I.O. 
to make it short.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B2/sentence/B2S8.mp3">I can send it to you through Inter Office mail.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B2/sentence/B2S9.mp3">I'll send it through Inter Office mail immediately.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B2/sentence/B2S10.mp3">I'll IO it to you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B2/sentence/B2S11.mp3">I need those documents. 
Can you IO it to me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B2/sentence/B2S12.mp3">Would you like to pick them up or should I send it through Inter Office mail?</a>"

The term inter basically means between when there is more than one. 
For example, in the word international, nation is a country, and if you have inter in front of it, we have international, which means involving two or more nations.

<h2>A Little Late</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/444-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you work for a company, there are times when you are late or you can't make it to a meeting. 
Sometimes you are sick, or sometimes you are stuck in traffic. 
We will study sentences you need to know to say why you are late or can't make it to work.

<b>Late</b>

Some jobs require you to 'punch in' when you get to work. 
'Punching in' keeps track of how long you worked. 
Many hourly jobs use this system. 
But if you are a salary person and do not have to 'punch in', then you have more flexibility. 
Let's say you are going to be five minutes late. 
If you have your own office, then nobody will know. 
But if you work in a setting where your boss sees you coming in, then you will need an excuse. 
We'll cover everything about being late here.

<b>Five minutes late</b>

If you are going to be just a little late, then you don't need to call in. 
However, you will need to tell them why you are late when you get in the office. 
Here are some examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S1.mp3">Sorry I'm late. 
Traffic was unusually bad today.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S2.mp3">I apologize for being late. 
I had to drop off my wife at work. 
It took longer than I thought.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S3.mp3">I had a dentist appointment this morning and it was longer than I expected.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S4.mp3">I'm sorry for being late. 
I got stuck in every light this morning.</a>"

If you are the boss, then you might want to ask why your employee is late. 
Let's see some of these sentences.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S5.mp3">Running late this morning?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S6.mp3">What held you up this morning?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S7.mp3">Do you have a reason for being late?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S8.mp3">Why are you late?</a>"

A boss or manager will not be too upset if you are late only once or very rarely. 
But if this is a constant habit, they might be a little more upset.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S9.mp3">You have been late three times in the last two weeks. 
Is this going to be a continual problem?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S10.mp3">Your tardiness is getting out of hand. 
You had better start managing your morning time better.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S11.mp3">I expect you to be at your desk at eight o'clock. 
Do you have a problem with this?</a>"

If you hear one of these statements, then you better say something that will calm the boss down. 
Also, you shouldn't let this happen again so tell him or her it won't happen again.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S12.mp3">I am terribly sorry. 
It won't happen again.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S13.mp3">I had a lot of recent changes at home, but it's all taken care of. 
I will not be late again.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B8/sentence/B8S14.mp3">I'm really sorry. 
It's been one of those weeks. 
It won't happen again.</a>"

<h2>Very Late</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/445-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are going to be a lot later than 5 minutes, then you should call your manager and tell them about it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B9/sentence/B9S1.mp3">Hi Barbara, I'm going to be 30 minutes late today. 
My car is having trouble this morning, so I arranged for a ride with a friend.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B9/sentence/B9S2.mp3">Hey Jack, I'm running a little late today. 
I just got out of my dentist appointment and it was longer than I expected.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B9/sentence/B9S3.mp3">Mark? This is Pat. 
I'm stuck in traffic. 
I think there is an accident that is holding up traffic. 
I'm going to be a little late.</a>"

When you plan on being late ahead of time, it is much easier. 
For example, if you have a doctor's appointment in the morning, you can tell them in advance and then you don't have to worry about coming in on time.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B9/sentence/B9S4.mp3">I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning. 
Remember I told you earlier this week? I'll come in right after my appointment.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B9/sentence/B9S5.mp3">My daughter has been sick, so I'm going to take her to see the doctor tomorrow morning. 
Is it ok if I'm a little late? My appointment is at seven in the morning, so I'll only be an hour late.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B9/sentence/B9S6.mp3">I have to take my parents to the airport tomorrow. 
I shouldn't be too late, but wanted to tell you ahead of time.</a>"

<h2>Leaving Work Early</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/446-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

This is a little easier than explaining to your boss why you are 10 minutes late. 
You can think of an excuse ahead of time, or tell them about an appointment so you can leave early. 
You can use the same excuses as the ones I mentioned earlier. 
You just have to change the wording a little and make it future tense.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B10/sentence/B10S1.mp3">I have to leave a little early today. 
Is it ok if I finish my work at home?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B10/sentence/B10S6.mp3">I have a terrible headache. 
Is it ok if I leave early today?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B10/sentence/B10S7.mp3">I think I might be coming down with the flu. 
I should get some rest and try to fight this thing off early.

I think I should get some rest.

<h2>Network share and public share</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/452-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Network share is a location on your network that you can access. 
The files are stored on a different computer. 
If you do not have a network set up in the office you work at, then you won't need this section.

In order for you to save data on a network share, you will need permission. 
The person in charge of the computer has the ability to add users. 
If you know of a public share and you cannot access it, then tell your administrator or the person in charge of that computer to give you permission.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S1.mp3">I have it saved on a network share. 
You can find it at <i>computername</i> public John data.doc.</a>"

Whenever you tell someone a network location, you tell them the name by the path. 
I'll use the previous sentence as an example. 
<i>Computername</i> is the name of the computer, then the next word is a folder name. 
The next name is also a folder name. 
Finally, data.doc is the name of the file. 
So, the location of data.doc is in a folder named John that is under a folder called public under the computer <i>computername</i>. When you say a path verbally, you just leave a pause after each word or say slash between the words. 
In the written form, it looks like this, \<i>computername</i>publicJohndata.doc.

When people share documents, they save them on their own computer and put it in a folder that they made public. 
Or, a co-worker might have data saved on their computer. 
If you don't want to deal with the floppy disks, then you can retrieve the data from the network if they make the folder public.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S2.mp3">I have those files in my public folder. 
Just go to John01 public. 
You should see all the documents there.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S3.mp3">I saved it at John01 public. 
Go ahead and take what you need.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S4.mp3">I'll need all the information on ABC Company. 
Didn't you say you have the information? Can you put them on a public share?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S5.mp3">Hey John, I don't have permission to get into John01. Can you check the permissions on the folder?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S6.mp3">I don't have write access on the folder. 
Can you give me write permissions?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B15/sentence/B15S7.mp3">I don't want anybody changing the data, so everyone only has read permissions.</a>"

<h2>Vacation</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/453-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Taking a planned day off</b>

These are the easiest to request. 
If you are caught up with your work and you want to take a vacation or personal day, it is as easy as asking for it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S1.mp3">Can I use a vacation day this Friday?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S2.mp3">Will it be ok if I use a personal day this Thursday?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S3.mp3">I have to catch up on a lot of errands, so can I use a vacation day on Monday?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S4.mp3">My parents are coming into town. 
Can I take Thursday and Friday off?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S5.mp3">I would like to use my vacation days for the first week of June. 
Will that be ok?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S6.mp3">Will it be ok if I take the last week of July off?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S7.mp3">Can I schedule a vacation for the second week of August?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B12/sentence/B12S8.mp3">I was wondering if I can take a vacation. 
Can I take the first two weeks off in September?</a>"

Remember that asking for a vacation all depends on the office policies. 
Some companies do not like an employee taking all their vacation days at once. 
However, some places are more lenient and allow long vacation days. 
Before asking for long vacation days, you should first see what other employees are doing.

<h2>Removable Disk</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/455-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you save data, there are several ways to save it. 
There is the standard removable disk, saving to the hard drive, and saving to a network share.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S1.mp3">Does anybody have an extra floppy disk?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S2.mp3">I ran out of floppy disks. 
Where can I get more?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S3.mp3">I think we need to order more floppy disks.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S4.mp3">I saved it on a floppy disk.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S5.mp3">I have all the information on my USB drive.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S6.mp3">Can you save the document on a disk and give it to me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S7.mp3">Save the information on a disk and give it to Jack.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S8.mp3">I'll have all the information on a disk and bring it to the meeting.</a>"

Standard floppy disks only hold 1.44 MB of information. 
There are times when the disk is not big enough. 
Here are ways to express this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S9.mp3">All the information doesn't fit on one disk.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S10.mp3">The file is too large to fit on a disk.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S11.mp3">Do you have a different storage device that can hold more information?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B13/sentence/B13S12.mp3">Can you order a 128 MB removable storage device for me? I always need to move files that a regular floppy disk cannot hold.</a>"

<h2>Hard Drive</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/456-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S1.mp3">I have all the information saved on my hard drive.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S2.mp3">I finished the presentation preparation and I saved it on my hard drive.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S3.mp3">I have the documents you are looking for saved on my computer.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S4.mp3">I have the information on my computer. 
Do you want me to put it on a floppy disk for you?</a>"

When you say something like, 'saved on my computer', it is understood that you are referring to the hard drive, so in this situation, you can use the two words interchangeably.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S5.mp3">I'm running out of room on my hard drive.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S6.mp3">I need a bigger hard drive.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B14/sentence/B14S7.mp3">I have the information on my computer, but I think I will need to prepare hard copies for the meeting.</a>"

Hard copy refers to something that is tangible. 
For example, a hard copy of a report is a printed out version on paper. 
A soft copy is the file stored on the computer.

<h2>Software</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/457-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Different companies use different software programs. 
For example, a tax firm might use a program for tax purposes, and an insurance company will use their own software for inputting data to retrieve quotes for customers. 
You might not have the software or it might be broken. 
I'll have some example sentences for these situations.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S1.mp3">What software do you use here?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S2.mp3">What kind of application do you use to keep track of all these records?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S3.mp3">Martha told me about TaxIt. 
When can I get a copy?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S4.mp3">Is there a manual how to use this program?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S5.mp3">How do you use this?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S6.mp3">TaxIt won't open any more. 
I think it's broken.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S7.mp3">I can't get TaxIt to work. 
Can someone help me with this?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S8.mp3">Microsoft Office applications do everything we need. 
That's all we use here.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S9.mp3">What version of Office do you use here?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S10.mp3">What software do you use for word processing?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S11.mp3">All the documents are saved using MSWord. 
Do you have Word or another application that will be able to read the information?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S12.mp3">We use a different word processing application. 
Can you save as a text file?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B16/sentence/B16S13.mp3">I can't open the file that you gave me. 
What version of Word are you using?</a>"

<h2>Internet</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/458-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

I'm not going to explain all the specifics about the Internet here. 
The goal of this lesson is not to give a computer lesson, but to learn English related to using the computer. 
I will show some sentences that are commonly used for the Internet.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S1.mp3">What is the URL of that site again?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S2.mp3">What is the address to the English site you are studying?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S5.mp3">If you go to greatsite.com, you will find all the information I just told you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S6.mp3">If you need more information on cooking, go to cooking.com.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S7.mp3">I purchased all the computers from Dell.com. 
We should have them by the end of the week.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S8.mp3">Do you have a company website?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S9.mp3">Is there a website where I can learn more about your services?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S10.mp3">Do you have a website where I can review the different products you are offering?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S11.mp3">I HATE POP-UPS!</a>"

I really do. 
I hate pop-up ads with a passion. 
If it was up to me, I would shut down all companies that produce pop up ads. 
For now, we have to live with them.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S12.mp3">Can I install something that stops pop-up ads?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S13.mp3">What tools are available to block pop-up ads?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B17/sentence/B17S15.mp3">I'm getting a page not found error. 
I think the web site is down.</a>"

<h2>Intranet</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/459-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

A lot of companies have an intranet site. 
This is basically web pages that can be viewed by employees connected to the network in the office. 
The address does not use the standard .net or .com address. 
It will simply be http://companysite.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B18/sentence/B18S1.mp3">Do we have an intranet site that explains our benefits?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B18/sentence/B18S2.mp3">What was the site where we log our travel expenses?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B18/sentence/B18S3.mp3">If you want to use a sick day, you can go to http://timereport.</a>"

If you have an intranet site for your company, then when you talk to other workers, you don't need to say http:// everytime. 
You can simply say the name, for example, 'If you want to use a sick day, you can go to time report.' The other person listening should understand that you mean http://timereport.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B18/sentence/B18S4.mp3">Is there an intranet site detailing each project our company is doing?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B18/sentence/B18S5.mp3">Is our company going to put an intranet site for employees?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B18/sentence/B18S6.mp3">I think it will help a lot if we had an intranet site with general questions and answers from all the employees.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B21/sentence/B21S5.mp3">Can I send you the information through email?</a>"

Whenever you send an email to an account that doesn't exist, you get an automated email saying the mail was not delivered. 
You can use these sentences if you are in this situation.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B21/sentence/B21S6.mp3">Can I verify your email address? The address I have on file appears to be incorrect.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B21/sentence/B21S7.mp3">I am unable to email it to you.

<h2>Sending attachments through email</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/464-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Some companies have security in place such as firewalls that prevents sending certain types of attachments. 
For example, sending a .js file is potentially dangerous because it can run scripts. 
Also, some documents can carry viruses through macros or other methods. 
Sending attachments to some email addresses are not possible. 
However, text files are usually permitted. 
Here are some sentences that you might find useful.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B22/sentence/B22S1.mp3">I can send you the document through email.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B22/sentence/B22S7.mp3">My company prevents many types of attachments. 
Can you send a text file instead?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B22/sentence/B22S8.mp3">Before you send the document, change the extension .doc to .txt and then send it. 
When I receive it, I will change it back to .doc before I open it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B22/sentence/B22S9.mp3">Hi Mary, I sent you an email with my proposal as an attachment. 
Did you receive it?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B22/sentence/B22S10.mp3">Hey Jack, did you receive my attachments?</a>"

<h2>Reply and Reply All</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/466-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you reply all, it goes out to everyone on the To line and the CC line. 
Reply only goes to the sender. 
When we send out a mail to many people, you might see a sentence that says 'little 'r' me'. This means to use the small R instead of the Big R. 
That basically means to reply only to me instead of replying to everyone on the mail thread.

A mail is also referred to as a thread. 
That is because in the office, a mail can go on back and forth among many people so it becomes a chain of mail that started from one email. 
I'll use these terminologies in the next several example sentences.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S1.mp3">I sent out a mail to the whole group. 
I requested that they little 'r' me with their ideas.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S2.mp3">When I receive a mail sent out to multiple people, I keep forgetting to send to all.</a>"

This next sentence is not a spoken sentence. 
It's a common sentence used in email when someone forgets to send to everyone.

'Resending to include everyone.'

If you see this, that means the person sent a reply to the sender instead of replying all.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S3.mp3">Start a mail thread on your idea. 
I think everyone should get in on this discussion.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S4.mp3">Do you want me to start a mail thread for this?</a>"

<h2>Forwarding Mail</h2>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S1.mp3">I can't find the mail about our next project. 
Can you forward the mail to me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S2.mp3">I got a useful email on productivity. 
I think I will forward it to our team.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S3.mp3">I have that email. 
I'll forward it to you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S4.mp3">If you find that mail, please forward it to me.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S5.mp3">I'll forward you the mail I got from the manager.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S6.mp3">I received a mail from the marketing manager. 
I don't know what she is asking for. 
Can I forward the mail to you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S7.mp3">One of our clients is asking for more data on the BB project.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S8.mp3">Forward the complaint to the manager. 
I think he should see this.</a>"

Sending to an alternate email address is common when the work email is not working. 
Here are some sentences you can use if you are ever in this situation. 
Some companies do not allow this, so make sure your company does not have policies prohibiting this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S9.mp3">My work email is currently down. 
Can you send it to my personal email address? It is someone@hotmail.com.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S10.mp3">I'm having problems with my work email account. 
Can you send it to someone@hotmail.com instead?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S11.mp3">I'm having problems sending you an email to this account. 
Is there another email account you have that I can try?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B25/sentence/B25S12.mp3">Our exchange server is down for the next thirty minutes. 
If this is urgent, you can send me an email to my personal account. 
It is someone@hotmail.com.</a>"

Although I have a couple of sentences on writing, most of this is to talk about email. 
Learning to write is not what I am trying to teach here. 
I want everyone to be able to speak. 
You should be practicing all of these lessons while talking along.

<h2>Explanations and Presentations General</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/470-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

This lesson will give some guidelines on how to explain something and how to speak during presentations. 
Because I cannot be specific to every topic, I'll choose general ones. 
You should primarily be looking at the structure and style for this Business English lesson.

It is understandable if you feel nervous or uneasy about having to explain something in 
English. 
Because English is not your first language, it is very difficult. 
However, in the office, you will be in many situations when you have to explain something. 
Here are 3 tips to make your explanation or presentation easier.

First, you should not talk fast. 
I work in a large company with many different people from all over the world. 
The hardest time I have when listening to someone is when they talk fast with a bad accent. 
The problem they have is that they are fluent and comfortable speaking English, but they do not realize how bad their accent is. 
If you speak slower, you can avoid this problem. 
Unless you are certain that your accent is understandable, always speak a little slower.

Second, you should speak clearly. 
Say each word clearly and emphasize the important words. 
Even if they don't understand every word in your sentence, they will understand the whole meaning with proper emphasis.

Third, prepare and practice ahead of time. 
You should record yourself and listen to the recording. 
You should also get an American friend to judge you. 
This is a lot of work you have to do in the beginning, but this is VERY important. 
Even though it will make your presentation or explanation clearer and better, that is not the reason I am saying you should do the recording and getting a friend to listen. 
The reason why this is so important is because you are laying the foundation on proper communication in regards to intonation and pronunciation. 
For example, if you don't do this, you might think you don't have a problem and you will continue to practice incorrectly. 
Soon, you will be someone who can talk fast but have terrible pronunciation. 
You will become the type of people I described... hard to understand. 
If you take the time to practice for several hours before each presentation, you will be practicing the correct way to enhance your English abilities.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/471-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The third step above is primarily for presentations. 
When you have to give an explanation, you might not have time to prepare for it. 
If someone asks you a question, you can't tell them that you will need two hours to prepare before answering.

However, if it is work related, you have the ability to anticipate questions ahead of time. 
Think of your area of expertise and list many questions you have heard from co-workers or friends. 
If you speak in your own language, you know exactly how to say it without preparing for it. 
But in English, you don't know where to begin. 
List all your answers out and learn how to say it in English. 
If you do this, then anytime you get asked a question about your area, you can quickly respond. 
Here is an example with more tips.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S1.mp3">Can you explain the process of selling a house and the cost associated with it?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S2.mp3">You can either sell the house by yourself or get an agent. 
Since most of the people use an agent, I will explain that. 
The first thing you need to do is find a sellers agent. 
The agent will list your house on the market. 
After the house is on the market, people who are looking to buy a house will find a buyers agent. 
The buyers agent looks through the list of houses for sale posted by the sellers agent. 
The buyers agent shows your house to potential buyers. 
When someone makes an offer, the buyers agent will let the sellers agent know about the price that the buyer has offered. 
After everyone agrees, the house is sold. 
The price associated with selling a house is based on commission. 
The sellers agent will get an average of 2.5 percent of the selling price and the buyers agent will get 2.5 percent as well. 
If the price of the house was $300,000, then each agent will get $7500, costing you a total of $15,000.</a>"

You're first reaction might be, 'when am I ever going to be able to say all this at one time?' But it is much easier than you think. 
I'll explain further.

We have someone asking about selling a house or something. 
We have to explain the process. 
Even if you don't know the process of selling a house in America, you can use the same guideline for your area of expertise. 
If you can say each sentence individually, then you can say all of them put together.

I start by saying there are a couple of ways to sell a house.
Then the example says you will explain the more common process.

From here, it is basically listing steps.

1. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S3.mp3">The first thing you need to do is find a sellers agent.</a>"
2. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S4.mp3">The agent will list your house on the market.</a>"
3. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S5.mp3">After the house is on the market, people who are looking to buy a house will find a buyers agent.</a>"
4. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S6.mp3">The buyers agent looks through the list of houses for sale posted by the sellers agent.</a>"
5. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S7.mp3">The buyers agent shows your house to potential buyers.</a>"
6. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S8.mp3">When someone makes an offer, the buyers agent will let the sellers agent know about the price that the buyer has offered.</a>"
7. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S9.mp3">After everyone agrees, the house is sold.</a>"
8. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S10.mp3">The price associated with selling a house is based on commission.</a>"
9. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S11.mp3">The sellers agent will get an average of 2.5 percent of the selling price and the buyers agent will get 2.5 percent as well.</a>"
10. "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S12.mp3">If the price of the house was $300,000, then each agent will get $7500, costing you a total of $15,000.</a>"

This list seems pretty simple now. 
Each sentence is relatively short. 
There is no difference between the long paragraph and the listed out items. 
Both contain the same words. 
All I did was put them together.

Finally, if you feel that you cannot create these sentences even in a list form, use an example that you are familiar with. 
I'm sure you will have an easy time creating a list if the topic is in your area of expertise.

I recommend listening to the paragraph again. 
But this time, listen to the speed I talk. 
Also, listen to the pauses after each sentence. 
Notice that I don't have unnecessary words like 'and', 'moreover', 'furthermore', 'Afterwards', and so on. 
These are good words, but you don't need them that much when you are explaining something verbally. 
Using pauses between sentences and speaking clearly and slowly is the best way to communicate an explanation.

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/472-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Presentations are longer than an explanation, but it is easier in the sense that you have time to prepare for it. 
The biggest mistake I have seen is that people do not use short simple sentences. 
Many of the best presentations from English speakers I have seen are those who use simple sentences that are easy to understand. 
Remember that a long paragraph can consist of 10 short sentences. 
It is still effective and much easier to say.

Many times, a person will be using a presentation software like Power Point. 
If that is the case, then you should prepare your slides and a separate document with your sentences for each slide. 
You shouldn't read them, but at least it is there just in case you forget to mention something. 
Use it as a preparation material before the presentation and reference during the presentation. 
Each sentence should be step by step explaining the content on the slide.

I am not going to be giving an example because presentations are all different depending on the subject. 
But keep in mind the process I explained on the house selling example. 
Keep the sentences short, speak slowly and clearly, put emphasis on key words, and leave a short pause after each sentence.

There are many times when you will have to explain something. 
Here are some questions you might hear.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S1.mp3">What did you do this week?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S2.mp3">What are you going to do next week?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S3.mp3">What is your schedule like for the next two weeks?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S4.mp3">Can you explain how to perform an evaluation for a partner feedback?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S5.mp3">How do I perform a refund for a credit card purchase?</a>"

There are numerous questions like these you might run into. 
To answer all of them, just follow the list example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S6.mp3">This week, I finished the analysis on Ford Motor, I started writing a report on international market penetration, and I showed our new employee how to use our software.</a>"

This example is very simple. 
It is basically a list of three things. 
You don't need to include any words in between.

You can use this same style of answer for many different types of questions.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S7.mp3">Next week, I have to finish my report, research information on GM Motors, and make a presentation on our market strategy.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S8.mp3">To perform a feedback on a partner you need to specify who the partner is, what project they worked on, the outcome of the project, where they need to improve, and finally what they did well.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B29/sentence/B29S9.mp3">On the credit card machine, press the refund button. 
Then type in the credit card number and press enter. 
Type in the amount, and press enter. 
That's all you need to do.</a>"

Whenever you are giving an explanation, remember the easiest way to do it is by giving a list and putting them together. 
In order to be able to do this, you must know how to say key words in your area of expertise.

When you have to give a presentation, remember that preparing is the most important. 
As I said earlier, take the time on your first several presentations to record yourself and find a friend to listen to your presentation.

Finally, let's review the three key steps you need to remember when giving an explanation or a presentation.

Don't talk fast: Even people with perfect English have this problem. 
Talking fast is not good when you are explaining something or giving a presentation.

Talk clearly: Making the words in each sentence clear will help anyone to understand you better.

Prepare and Practice: This is the most important. 
As time goes on, you will realize how much your preparation will help with your overall English skills.

<h2>Before the meeting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/473-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are many questions to ask before a meeting. 
If you are curious about what the meeting will cover, you will need to ask the organizer of the meeting. 
You can also ask things like how long the meeting will take, and who is coming to the meeting. 
Let's try a couple of these sentences.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S1.mp3">Hi Jack. 
Do you know who is coming to your meeting at 2:00?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S2.mp3">Who all did you invite to the triage meeting?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S3.mp3">Hi Jack. 
How long do you think the meeting will be?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S4.mp3">I have to schedule another appointment at 4:00 but I don't want it to overlap with yours. 
How long is the meeting going to be?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S5.mp3">Is the meeting going to be more than an hour?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S6.mp3">What time was the meeting again?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S7.mp3">When are you going to make that presentation? I thought it was today?</a>"

Here are common statements people use when they can't attend a meeting.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S8.mp3">I have another appointment that conflicts with your meeting. 
I will not be able to make it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S9.mp3">I have another meeting that I cannot miss. 
I won't be able to make yours.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S10.mp3">I won't be able to go to the 3:00 meeting. 
I have another appointment at the same time.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S11.mp3">I can't go to the meeting at 4:00. I have a doctor's appointment. 
Can you take notes for me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B30/sentence/B30S12.mp3">I'm going to be out of town tomorrow, so I won't be able to attend the quarterly meeting. 
Can you send me a mail on the topics that were discussed?</a>"

<h2>Canceling a Meeting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/474-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are the meeting organizer, then there are times when you have to cancel a meeting. 
Here are some sentences you can use for this situation.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B31/sentence/B31S1.mp3">There are four people who will not be able to attend the meeting tomorrow. 
I am going to reschedule the meeting to a more convenient time.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B31/sentence/B31S2.mp3">The director asked that we postpone the finance meeting until the quarterly report comes out. 
So I'll send an update with the new date and time later this week.</a>"

Some meetings are weekly meetings that occur at the same time. 
It is common that these meetings are canceled when there is nothing to talk about.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B31/sentence/B31S3.mp3">There is nothing new to discuss this week, so we are going to cancel this week's agenda meeting.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B31/sentence/B31S4.mp3">I am running late this morning. 
Let's postpone the meeting until the afternoon.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B31/sentence/B31S5.mp3">I can't make it in tomorrow, so let's cancel this week's meeting. 
I'll email everyone if something new comes up.</a>"

<h2>During the Meeting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/475-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you have to talk in a meeting, there are three general reasons. 
You might have to ask a question, state your opinion, or you will have to ask for clarity on something you didn't understand. 
Let's see some of these sentences.

<b>Raising a Question</b>

Depending on the type of meeting, you might have to wait for the meeting to end before asking a question, you might have to raise your hand to ask a question, or you can simply ask a question any time. 
I'll give an example on each of these.

If you are in a type of meeting where you can ask a question at any time, then you can say this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S1.mp3">I have a question. 
Why is marketing not handling the portion on end user analysis? They usually did this work in the past.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S2.mp3">How will the new addition to our project affect the deadline that we have?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S3.mp3">Are we making sure to incorporate user feedback on the changes we are making?</a>"

<b>Stating your Opinion</b>

Basically, you can ask any questions, there is no specific way to do it. 
This is the same when you are talking about your opinion. 
Someone might ask what you think about the idea or situation. 
You will simply speak your answer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S4.mp3">I agree with Mark. 
The correct approach is to send out the tools to our partners before making it public to everyone.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S5.mp3">In my opinion, I think we should introduce our new line of printers in August. 
Many companies get more funding at this time, and students are school shopping. 
Our target market will be more responsive to our ads during this time period.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S6.mp3">I think we can go either way. 
I believe both solutions will take care of it.</a>"

<b>Asking for clarity</b>

Asking for clarity is similar to asking a question. 
The only difference is that they already answered it and you don't understand. 
So you should state exactly what you don't know, or ask for clarity on a specific part of the question.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S7.mp3">I didn't understand why we are going to be late. 
I thought we had everything planned out early. 
What were the reasons again?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S8.mp3">Can you elaborate on how this process can help the sales department?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B32/sentence/B32S9.mp3">Can you clarify the second step in your solution proposal? I don't understand why it is necessary.</a>"

<h2>After the Meeting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/476-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

It is common to talk about meetings afterwards. 
Sometimes it is to say how useless it was, or that you were bored, but there are times when someone might ask you for feedback. 
Other times, you might want feedback if you were the person holding the meeting. 
Let's cover these here.

<b>Asking for Feedback</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S1.mp3">What did you think about my presentation?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S2.mp3">Did you think the meeting went ok?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S3.mp3">Can you provide feedback on the meeting we just had?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S4.mp3">Did you find the meeting useful?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S5.mp3">Did the meeting help to clarify the current situation?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S6.mp3">Is there any part of our discussion during the meeting that you are still unsure about?</a>"

<b>Providing Feedback</b>

Even if you think the meeting was boring and useless, you can't say that unless you are talking to a close friend. 
Many times in the office, you have to give a professional answer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S7.mp3">I thought the presentation went well. 
You provided great information and I think everyone was impressed.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S8.mp3">The meeting went well. 
We covered a lot of information and made some important decisions.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S9.mp3">The whole presentation went pretty well, but next time I would recommend that you talk a little slower. 
When we were running out of time, you started speaking too fast and it was hard to keep up.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S10.mp3">Most of the time, our weekly meeting is pretty dull, but today was quite useful.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S11.mp3">I understand what is happening to our project now, but I'm still unclear about exactly who is affected by this change.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S13.mp3">Can you set up a meeting for our brainstorm session?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S14.mp3">My calendar looks pretty clear on Thursday. 
Set up a meeting for that day.</a>"

If you have a close friend in the office, then you can speak more candidly. 
Here are some general statements you can make about meetings. 
But be careful who you say them to.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S15.mp3">I hate meetings. 
I think they are a waste of time. 
I'm an engineer, not a planner.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S16.mp3">I don't know why I have to go to those meetings. 
I never learn anything from them and I never say a thing.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S17.mp3">I can't believe our weekly meeting is at six o'clock in the morning. 
I hate waking up that early.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S18.mp3">If I skip that meeting, I wonder if anyone will notice.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S19.mp3">That meeting was hilarious. 
I can't believe the manager forgot John's name.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S20.mp3">I get so sleepy at meetings.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S21.mp3">I almost fell asleep during that meeting.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B34/sentence/B34S22.mp3">I had a hard time keeping myself from laughing. 
I saw you falling asleep during the meeting.</a>"

<h2>Phone Call</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/478-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Talking on the phone is very common in the office. 
You will be in a situation where you have to call someone, receive a phone call, leave a message, return a call, and a variety of other tasks. 
We will use this lesson to cover all the details about making and receiving phone calls.

Receiving a call is probably the easiest.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S1.mp3">Hello, this is Mike.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S2.mp3">Microsoft, this is Steve.</a>"

Calling someone is a little more difficult. 
You should state your name, where you are from, what you are calling for, and the question. 
Let's give it a try through an example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S3.mp3">Hi Mary, this is Michael Johnson from ABC Consulting. 
I am reviewing the financial data for the payroll project. 
I will need the 2002 fiscal report to complete this task. 
Do you know where I can get a copy?</a>"

This example is very clear, organized, and concise. 
It first explains who the person is, what they are doing, and what they need. 
If you need to call someone to obtain information, you can use this type of sentence.

Let's try one more, but this time, you are asking for help.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S4.mp3">Hi Bob. 
This is Steven from ABC Company. 
I'm calling in regards to the data entry program you created. 
I'm having trouble locating where the connection is made to the server. 
Can you help me with this?</a>"

Similarly, this phone call starts with an introduction of the person, a quick sentence on what the call is regarding, and a short description on what this person needs. 
If you are in this situation, use this process and write it down so you can say what you need smoothly. 
After you become familiar with it, you will not need to write it down anymore and you should be able to say it fluently.

If you have questions and a consultant or another business employee is visiting your company, then asking a question to them is very similar to asking a question to anyone else.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S5.mp3">Hi Bob. 
I'm George. 
I'm the technical writer for this project. 
I had a question regarding the installation process. 
If you have a minute, can you show me the installation process? I'm having problems on the confirmation section.</a>"

Usually, when a person is visiting your company, then it is polite to tell them your position so they can understand what type of help you will need. 
In the previous example, we used the same process of asking for help with an introduction, telling them what it is regarding, and what the problem or question is.

<b>Verifying Information</b>

Sometimes you have to verify an order, or double check a figure. 
If you have the information and you just want to verify that it is accurate, then you can use these types of sentences.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S6.mp3">Hi Debra, I'm analyzing the log files and noticed entry 14 was negative 42. Can you confirm if this is accurate?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S7.mp3">I see that our April 2003 revenue was 1.2 million dollars. 
Can you double check that this figure is accurate?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B35/sentence/B35S8.mp3">I am going to meet with the CFO in an hour. 
Can you look through this report and double check my findings? It should only take you 20 minutes or so.</a>"

<h2>Telling person you will call them back</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/479-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you receive a question from a client or customer that you do not know, you can either tell them that you will find the answer for them, or tell them to call someone else. 
Let's learn how to do these things professionally.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B36/sentence/B36S1.mp3">I don't have the answer right off hand. 
I'll need to find that information for you. 
Will it be ok if I call you back in about 30 minutes?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B36/sentence/B36S2.mp3">I believe I can find that information for you. 
It might take 10 minutes or so. 
Can I call you back with the information?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B36/sentence/B36S3.mp3">I'm not sure about the answer. 
I'll find the information and call you right back. 
Will that be ok?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B36/sentence/B36S4.mp3">I'm not sure about this one. 
Let me ask my manager. 
Can you please hold?</a>"

<h2>Redirecting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/480-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Receiving a Call</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S1.mp3">I believe Joe Carry in marketing can help you with that. 
Do you have his contact information?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S2.mp3">I'm not sure about that. 
I'm pretty sure Mitch Smith will be able to answer this and other questions. 
Let me give you his number.</a>"

<b>Making a Call</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S3.mp3">Can you redirect me to that person?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S4.mp3">Can I get his contact information?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S5.mp3">Can I get his phone number?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S6.mp3">What is the best way to contact her?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S7.mp3">Can you direct me to someone who can help?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B37/sentence/B37S8.mp3">Hi, this is Matt from ABC Company. 
I have some questions on your Platinum level business package. 
Can you redirect me to someone who can help?</a>"

<h2>Leaving Messages</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/481-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you call someone and they are not there, you have to leave a message on their voice mail. 
Remember to state your name, your company, and what the phone call is regarding. 
Then leave your phone number even though you think they have it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B38/sentence/B38S1.mp3">Hi Mary, this is Josh from ABC Company. 
I have some questions regarding the financial data you sent me yesterday. 
Can you give me a call back when you have time? My number is 555-123-4567. Thank you.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B38/sentence/B38S2.mp3">Hi Jack, this is Julie from Consult R Us. 
I am missing a couple pages on the document you sent me. 
Can you call me when you are free? My number again is 555-321-7654. Thank you.</a>"

In some cases, you will receive a phone message like this. 
If you have to call them back and they are not there also, you can leave a message saying, you are returning their call. 
Here is an example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B38/sentence/B38S3.mp3">Hi Josh, this is Mary and I am returning your call. 
I'll be in the office for the next three hours, so feel free to call me back any time. 
Just in case, my number is 555-234-5678.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B38/sentence/B38S4.mp3">Hi Julie, this is Jack. 
I double checked the documents I sent you and I am not sure what pages you are missing. 
I might not be at my desk, so feel free to call me on my cell phone. 
The number is 227-1000. Hope to hear from you soon so we can straighten this out.</a>"

On another occasion, you might call someone and they might not call you back. 
In this case, it is polite to call them again. 
This is how you can leave a second message.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B38/sentence/B38S5.mp3">Hi Mary, this is Josh again from ABC Company. 
I'm not sure if you got my first message so I am leaving one more. 
I have some questions regarding the financial data you sent me several days ago. 
Can you call me at 555-123-4567 when you get a chance? Thank you.</a>"

If the company does not have voice mail, you can leave a message with the secretary. 
After asking for the person you are looking for, if they say they are not in, then leave a message with them.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B38/sentence/B38S6.mp3">Can you have Julie return my call? This is Jack, and my number is 555-123-4567.</a>"

<h2>Sending and receiving information</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/482-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

While you are working, you will need to send information back and forth to business partners or to clients and customers. 
Since email is covered in its own separate section, let's work on sending packages through the mail and the fax machine.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S1.mp3">Hi Jack, I have the final documents requiring your signature. 
I will have them delivered to you by tomorrow. 
If you can sign them and return them, we can submit the documents by Friday.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S2.mp3">Hi Ruth, I have the escrow papers ready for review. 
Should I mail them to you, or can I fax them?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S3.mp3">Do you have a fax machine?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S4.mp3">Can I have your fax number?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S5.mp3">When you finish the final review, can you fax over the documents. 
Our fax number is 555-345-6789.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S6.mp3">I have a package that I am going to send out. 
I will Fed-Ex it to you tonight.</a>"

Fed-Ex is a short way of saying Federal Express. 
It is a delivery company that ships immediately. 
A lot of businesses in the States use this method of shipping things, so it became common to say, 'Fed-Ex it.'

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S7.mp3">I believe I have your fax number. 
Is it 555-234-5678?</a>"

If a person said they will send information, you might have to call them to check on the status if you haven't received it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S8.mp3">Hi Mary, this is Diana at ABC Marketing Co. 
Can I get a status on the fax you are going to send over?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S9.mp3">Can you check on the status of the documents you are faxing to me? I haven't received it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B39/sentence/B39S10.mp3">Hi Mary, I didn't receive the fax last night. 
Can you fax it again? We should also confirm what fax number you have on file.</a>"

<h2>Talking to Co-Workers</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/484-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

What ever company you work for, you will have a boss or a manager. 
If you are a manager, you will have directs reporting to you. 
And in most cases, you will have to work with co-workers. 
This lesson will cover the English you need to know to speak to co-workers. 
I will also have a lesson on talking to the manager and subordinates.

When you talk with a co-worker, most of it is small talk. 
You can talk about your background, what school you attended, your major, and your previous work experience. 
So studying the English lessons along side the business section will help you for your daily English needs. 
However, I'll have some sentences you can use when you are talking with a co-worker.

If you miss a meeting, then you will need to ask a co-worker what happened during the meeting.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S1.mp3">I missed the meeting. 
Can you fill me in?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S2.mp3">I had a doctor's appointment so I missed the meeting. 
What happened?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S3.mp3">I couldn't make it to the meeting today. 
Anything interesting I should know about?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S4.mp3">I missed the meeting. 
Was there anything new?</a>"

Another time you talk with a co-worker is if the boss is mad or you don't like the boss. 
But whenever you talk about bad things with co-workers, make sure you are talking to a friend. 
If that person is not a friend, then they might tell your manager what you said.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S5.mp3">Matt looks pretty upset right now. 
Do you know what's going on?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S6.mp3">Did something happen recently? Matt looks pissed off.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S7.mp3">I think Matt is mad about something. 
Do you know what it could be?</a>"

Or if the manager only treats you bad, then you can ask your co-worker/friend if the manager treats them differently or the same.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S8.mp3">Matt talks to me like he is mad all the time. 
Does he do that to you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S9.mp3">Does Matt talk to you like he is upset? Or is it just me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S10.mp3">It's not you at all. 
He talks to me that way too.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S11.mp3">Matt is way too moody.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S12.mp3">If he knew what he was doing, we wouldn't be in this mess.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S13.mp3">What is wrong with Matt these days?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S14.mp3">He is having one of those days again. 
I think his manager just gave him a hard time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S15.mp3">What do you think about our manager?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B40/sentence/B40S16.mp3">He gets too mad easily and he doesn't really help us out that much. 
What do you think?</a>"

<h2>Asking for help or offering help</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/485-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you offer to help someone, you are asking your co-worker if they want to give you some of their work. 
Here are a couple of ways you can offer some help.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B41/sentence/B41S1.mp3">I finished my project already so I have extra bandwidth. 
Let me know if you need help with anything.</a>"

Bandwidth is usually used as a networking terminology. 
But in this context, it means having extra time.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B41/sentence/B41S2.mp3">You're doing the analysis on ABC Company? I did that last year. 
If you need any help, just let me know.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B41/sentence/B41S3.mp3">I'm pretty familiar with your project so if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.</a>"

Asking for help is a little more difficult. 
You will have to see what the work environment is like and what type of relationship you have with your co-workers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B41/sentence/B41S4.mp3">I'm having trouble implementing Plan A on ABC Company. 
Can you look at my work and see if I am missing a step?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B41/sentence/B41S5.mp3">Can you help me analyze the finance data? This is my first time and I don't want to screw it up.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B41/sentence/B41S6.mp3">Do you have a few minutes to help me with the data migration tool? I can't figure it out.</a>"

<h2>Complaining about another co-worker to a co-worker</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/486-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

I remember in my first job, I had a co-worker I really didn't like. 
He was a nice guy, but he was a complete idiot. 
To vent out my frustration, I talked with some closer co-workers about my problems with him. 
Here are some of the things I said. 
You might be in a similar situation of dealing with a complete idiot.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S1.mp3">Have you worked with Jake yet? He can't do anything right.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S2.mp3">The problem with Jake is that he doesn't know that he is an idiot.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S3.mp3">I remember helping Jake out so much, and then he stabs my back.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S4.mp3">I don't think he does his own work. 
He goes around asking everyone to do a portion of his work and says he did it all.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S5.mp3">If you have to work with Jake, remember the things I told you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S6.mp3">Is management blind or am I being too sensitive about this?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S7.mp3">I think the manager likes him because he kisses her ass all day long.</a>"

Kissing ass refers to butt kiss and brown nosing. 
Basically, a person who butt kisses is a person always saying good things to the manager, giving compliments, showing off in front of the manager, and doing anything possible to look good.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S8.mp3">The manager is blind because he is a total brown-noser.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S9.mp3">I can't believe this company is paying $75,000 a year for this fool.</a>"

<h2>Complaining about the company</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/487-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

As I already said previously, make sure you are careful who you talk to when you are complaining about anything such as the company.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S1.mp3">This is a dead end job. 
I don't see much of a future here.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S2.mp3">I hate the redundancy. 
It's so boring.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S3.mp3">Work isn't exciting for me anymore. 
I am doing the same thing over and over again.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S4.mp3">This company doesn't care about employees that much. 
I haven't received a fair raise in 3 years.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S5.mp3">I don't know if it is my manager or this company, but I'm really getting sick of my job.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S7.mp3">What do you think about all the politics in this company?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S8.mp3">The politics suck here. 
But it is the same for any large corporation. 
The best way to deal with it is to take advantage of the rules.</a>"

I heard in some countries that switching companies is not common. 
Once you have a decent job in a decent company, the person usually works there all their life. 
In the States however, changing jobs and changing companies is very common. 
That makes it a common discussion to have with friends and co-workers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S9.mp3">I don't know how much longer I can take this job. 
I've been thinking about applying to a different company.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S10.mp3">Have you ever thought about leaving this company?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S11.mp3">What company do you want to switch to?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S12.mp3">I started applying for other jobs. 
There are a lot of positions open.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B43/sentence/B43S13.mp3">I've been looking for jobs on monster.com. 
They have a lot of positions available.</a>"

<h2>Talking about work experience</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/488-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

I won't cover topics we have in our regular English lessons, but talking about work experience is not a separate topic I have, so let's spend a few minutes here.

When you are talking to a co-worker, you can talk about many different things. 
One of the topics might be previous work experience. 
Whenever you receive this question, the easiest way to answer this is to say where you worked and what you did.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B44/sentence/B44S1.mp3">What did you do before working here?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B44/sentence/B44S2.mp3">I worked at ABC Company. 
I was a market analyst researching what the user wants in portable devices.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B44/sentence/B44S3.mp3">I was over in the sales department on the second floor. 
I was in charge of overseeing the sales made by all the sales associates each month.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B44/sentence/B44S4.mp3">I was a software engineer at Sun Microsystems. 
I created internal tools using Java to help automate the recruiting process.</a>"

<h2>Talking to the Boss</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/490-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Unless you are the owner of the company, you will have a boss. 
This lesson will cover all English you need to know to express what you want to say to your boss. 
This will include asking for feedback, explanation, showing frustration, asking for more work, and more.

If you are doing a project and you want your manager to review it before submitting it, then you can ask the manager in several ways.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S1.mp3">Did you want to review my project?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S2.mp3">I just completed the assignment. 
Did you want to review it?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S3.mp3">This is my first project and I was wondering if you could review it real quick?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S4.mp3">I think I covered all the bases, but could you do a quick check.</a>"

If you are new at your job, then it is good to ask for feedback. 
This can be done when you complete a project or after several months on the job. 
Some companies have a process in place where you have a weekly one on one meeting with your manager. 
You can use this time to talk about your work and anything else on your mind. 
If you don't have a weekly meeting, then you might have to set up a time with your manager to discuss your progress.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S5.mp3">Hi Roger, can we set up a time to discuss my progress so far?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S6.mp3">I was wondering if we can meet to discuss how I am doing.</a>"

If you are doing work that doesn't include projects or assignments, then you can't ask for feedback on the work you completed. 
But you can ask how you have been doing in the last several months.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S7.mp3">Can I get some feedback on my performance?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S8.mp3">Where do you think I need to improve?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S9.mp3">What areas do you think I should work on?</a>"

If you have a project you completed, you can ask for feedback on the project. 
But make sure you give your manager enough time to review the work before asking for feedback.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S10.mp3">Did you finish reviewing my project I completed?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S11.mp3">Hi Mark, this was my first project, and I wanted to know how I did so I can improve.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S12.mp3">Where do you think I could have done better?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S13.mp3">Is there any areas that I could have done better?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S14.mp3">What should I do better for next time?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B45/sentence/B45S15.mp3">What areas did I do well, and what areas did I do poorly.</a>"

<h2>Asking for more work</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/491-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Most companies will have so much work that you will never run out of things to do. 
But there are times when you don't have enough to do. 
In this situation, you should ask your manager to give you more work.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S1.mp3">Hi Mark, I finished all my weekly duties already. 
Do you have more work I can do?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S2.mp3">I've been completing my work early on a regular basis. 
Can I have more responsibilities?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S3.mp3">I have a lot of extra time. 
I usually double check all my work, but that doesn't take much time. 
Is there any additional work I can do?</a>"

Although asking for more work is a good sign of being productive, there is actually something better. 
Instead of asking for more work, find the extra work without asking. 
After you find something to do, then tell your manager that you want to do the work.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S4.mp3">I had extra time on my hands so I started investigating the network problem. 
If you don't mind, I would like to work on this project to help the office productivity around here.</a>"

If you are a manager, would you want someone asking you what to do, or would you prefer a worker who found a problem and wants to fix it. 
I have had people ask me for more work and it is stressful trying to think of something. 
I am busy and don't have that much time to find extra work. 
If a worker identifies more work to do, then I would appreciate it that much more.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S5.mp3">I have been completing my work a day early every week. 
I know the reference material has been sitting there for some time. 
Would you like me to do that project, or did you want to assign another project to me?</a>"

Although having extra time to do more work is a good situation to be in, there might be times when you have too much work. 
Here are a couple of sentences to ask for help.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S6.mp3">Hi Mark, the addition we made to the project made it difficult to complete by myself. 
If the deadline doesn't change, I will need some help to complete it. 
Can you assign someone to help me out?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S7.mp3">I have spent every minute on this project and have been putting in serious overtime. 
This project is a lot bigger than we anticipated. 
I am going to need some help to complete it on time. 
Do you have anyone available to help me?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B46/sentence/B46S8.mp3">The Alpha project has been eating so much of my time that I didn't have much time to work on the Beta project. 
Is there anyone with extra bandwidth to help me finish the Beta project?</a>"

<h2>Complaining and Showing Frustration</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/492-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Showing frustration is ok if you do it right. 
If you are frustrated and you start complaining, then the manager will either think you are not capable of doing your work, or the manager will realize that you have way too much work. 
So it is important how you complain and how you show your frustration.

Showing frustration because of your mistake is ok to do. 
It shows that you are upset at yourself and that you can't believe you made a mistake. 
So it is indicating to the manager that you are not going to screw up again. 
Hopefully you won't screw anything up, but just in case, here are some ways to show your frustration.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B47/sentence/B47S1.mp3">I can't believe I messed that up. 
I don't think I am stupid, but this is suggesting otherwise.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B47/sentence/B47S2.mp3">I am so frustrated at myself. 
How did I not catch that?</a>"

Complaining about someone else is not good. 
But if you are so frustrated and you have to tell your manager, take a deep breath, calm yourself down, and say something like my example as calmly as you can.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B47/sentence/B47S3.mp3">It's frustrating working with Tim. 
I'm doing everything I can to help and I am trying to be understanding, but he is slowing our project down immensely.</a>"

The best kind of frustration is when the manager knows exactly what you are talking about. 
If the manager is frustrated as well, then he or she will completely understand. 
An example of this is when you are working with another company and they are not doing their work properly.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B47/sentence/B47S4.mp3">I'm having a hard time working with ABC Company. 
They are always late and the work they do has numerous errors. 
It is really frustrating because I have to spend a great deal of time proof reading the material. 
I recommend not giving ABC Company any more work.</a>"

<h2>Talking to your boss about another boss</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/493-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Sometimes there are multiple bosses and they both give you work. 
This can cause some problems. 
The best way to handle this situation is to tell your direct boss what is happening so it gets straightened out at the management level.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B48/sentence/B48S1.mp3">Hey Mark. 
I'm doing all the projects you gave me, but John gives me additional work. 
I don't mind it, but lately it's been too much.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B48/sentence/B48S2.mp3">Hey Mark. 
John has been assigning a lot of work to me. 
I have a lot of current work I am doing, so I would like to know what work has more priority.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B48/sentence/B48S3.mp3">John wants me to do the payroll analysis. 
He said he needs it by end of week. 
But didn't you want the employee headcount finished by Friday? I can't finish both. 
What should I do first?</a>"

If another boss is giving you a hard time, you can tell your manager what you think. 
Here are some professional sentences that you can use to show your frustration about another boss.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B48/sentence/B48S4.mp3">I'm having some problems with John lately. 
He is very critical and puts me down in public. 
I don't know what I am doing wrong so I don't know where I need to improve. 
What do you think I should do about this?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B48/sentence/B48S5.mp3">John has been very difficult to work with. 
He is very bossy and expects everything to be done his way. 
I have been tolerating it because he is a manager, but some of his methods are wasting a lot of time. 
I always suggest other ways, but he will not hear me out.</a>"

<h2>Talking to your Subordinate or Direct</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/495-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are a manager, then you will more likely have someone reporting to you. 
The most common terminology I am used to is a direct. 
Throughout this lesson, I will use the word direct.

There are many things you have to say to a direct. 
You have to give them work, explain things, encourage them to do better, and even reprimand them when they are not performing well. 
We will cover these types of sentences in this lesson.

<b>Status</b>

A common question a manager asks is to find out what the status of a project is.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S1.mp3">What is the status of the marketing documents?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S2.mp3">How far along are you in your analysis?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S3.mp3">Are you almost done with the technical report?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S4.mp3">When are you going to finish the design plans?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S5.mp3">Can you give me a status on your progress so far?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S6.mp3">How is the reporting assignment going?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S7.mp3">When can you give me a working draft by?</a>"

Requesting a weekly status mail from your direct is very common among large companies with many employees. 
Basically, the status mail will include what has been accomplished the current week, and what will be done next week. 
If your company has this process, or if you just want to implement it yourself, you can tell your direct something like the following.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S8.mp3">At the end of every week, can you send me a weekly status mail? I'll email you a template you should follow. 
You should email it to me every Friday.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S9.mp3">I want you to send me a status report at the end of every week. 
You should include what you did for that week and what you plan on doing for the next week.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B49/sentence/B49S10.mp3">Can you send me a weekly status report? If you haven't done it before, let me know and I will send you a template to use.</a>"

<h2>Project Change</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/496-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are times when a project changes and you have to tell your direct to change something. 
Let's work on some sentences where you do this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B50/sentence/B50S1.mp3">I know you have been working on the database using excel, but we need to use SQL. 
Can you make the necessary changes?</a>"

Although you don't have to be polite to your direct, it is good practice to show directs some common courtesy. 
In the sentence above, it recognizes the work that has been done so far, instructs what needs to be changed, and politely asks if they can do it. 
You should follow a similar way of asking your direct to change something.

In another scenario, your direct might give you a report to review. 
If something is incorrect, or not complete, you should tell them professionally what needs to be redone.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B50/sentence/B50S2.mp3">Hey Jackie, I reviewed your report and there are a couple areas you have to change. 
Can you double check the figures you provided in page 7, and provide a recommendation for step 3? I would appreciate it.</a>"

This example is a little more firm, but still polite. 
It states that changes are required, it then asks if two things can be changed, and finally, adds a good comment about appreciating the work.

Finally, your direct could be doing something on a regular basis that you don't like. 
As a manager, you should tolerate things that do not affect the work, but if there is something that is work related, it is your responsibility to tell that person. 
Let's use an example where a person has a habit of talking before someone finishes.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B50/sentence/B50S3.mp3">John, when we are discussing something in meetings or small groups, I noticed that you don't allow the other person to complete their sentences. 
I do appreciate your contributions, but I think you should always hear the other person out. 
Can you try to do that?</a>" 

Adding a simple phrase like appreciating the contribution can make a huge difference when giving criticism. 
There is a great chance the direct will be offended or upset. 
But if you add a small compliment in there, the chances of the direct accepting your criticism will be that much greater.

<h2>Deadline</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/497-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Deadlines and due dates are common among projects and assignments. 
Sometimes the deadline changes or your direct needs a reminder. 
In any case, you should know some sentences how to convey the deadline.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B51/sentence/B51S1.mp3">Here is your new project. 
You have two weeks to complete it. 
After you review the project, let me know if there will be any problems.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B51/sentence/B51S2.mp3">You have until the end of this month to complete your assignment. 
It is critical that everyone completes on time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B51/sentence/B51S3.mp3">We have two more days to complete the test pass. 
If anyone cannot complete their portion on time, let me know as soon as possible.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B51/sentence/B51S4.mp3">We are not required to send in our analysis until Wednesday, so you have a couple more days to complete it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B51/sentence/B51S5.mp3">Do you think you can finish the marketing report by Friday?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B51/sentence/B51S6.mp3">Our deadline is fast approaching. 
I try to minimize weekend work, but we might have to work this Saturday if we do not finish on Friday.</a>"

<h2>Subordinate asking you Questions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/498-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

All directs at one time or another asks you questions on how to do something, or asks what something is. 
The average employee will usually ask you something that is obvious and you simply tell them. 
Sometimes however, a smart employee asks difficult questions that you are not sure about.

If an employee asks you a factual question that you are not sure about, you can always refer them to other sources.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B52/sentence/B52S1.mp3">I'm not sure about that one. 
I think the information you are looking for is in a manual I saw in the file cabinet. 
Why don't you check there?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B52/sentence/B52S2.mp3">Do a search on Google and see if you can find the information there.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B52/sentence/B52S3.mp3">I think Stacy will know the answer. 
She is very familiar with that topic.</a>"

If the question is more process related where it involves an opinion, you can answer telling them what you would do.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B52/sentence/B52S4.mp3">I'm not sure on the exact procedure, but if I were you, I would do the forth step before the third one.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B52/sentence/B52S5.mp3">I don't think we ever decided on a specific way. 
I think it might be better to do this before that.</a>"

These are vague sentences, so you should fill in the details depending on your situation.

<h2>Encouraging</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/499-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

As a good manager, you should encourage great workers and bad workers. 
Good directs need encouraging to keep them working hard. 
Bad employees need encouragement to work harder. 
Here are some sentences for both types.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B53/sentence/B53S1.mp3">Hey James, I think you're doing a great job and it is not going unnoticed.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B53/sentence/B53S2.mp3">You're doing great. 
Keep up the good work.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B53/sentence/B53S3.mp3">I told my manager about your performance. 
He was quite impressed. 
Keep up the good work.</a>"

Directs having difficulty

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B53/sentence/B53S4.mp3">I had a hard time on my first project too. 
Don't let it get you down. 
I'm sure you will do better next time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B53/sentence/B53S5.mp3">It wasn't as bad as you think. 
I also saw definite improvements so you shouldn't give up.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B53/sentence/B53S6.mp3">Your work has been pretty good, but I really think you can do better. 
You have potential and I hope you start trying a little harder.</a>"

<h2>Reprimanding</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/500-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Finally, when you have an employee that is doing something wrong such as being late, turning in a project late, or not performing well, it is your responsibility to let them know.

If someone is always late, then you don't have to ask for an excuse. 
If it was one time, then it is ok, but if they are constantly late, there is no excuse for it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S1.mp3">You have been late for work on a regular basis. 
You better start coming to work on time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S2.mp3">This is your third warning. 
If you are late for work again, we will have to take more serious action on you. 
Is that understood?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S3.mp3">Being late for work once in a while is understandable. 
But there is no excuse to be coming in to work late every day. 
You better start coming in on time.</a>"

When a direct doesn't turn in a project, it's a pretty serious no-no. 
I would definitely be upset, but as a good manager, I wouldn't accuse the employee without giving them a chance to explain. 
Here is an example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S4.mp3">The report was due last Friday. 
What's going on?</a>"

This is more like a trap question. 
Unless it is a life or death situation, the excuse shouldn't be good enough. 
Here is a generic excuse.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S5.mp3">I was working on three other assignments. 
I just couldn't finish them all.</a>"

This is not a good excuse, so you can start reprimanding the employee. 
You gave them a chance to explain, and since the excuse wasn't good enough, you can basically, 'let them have it.'

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S6.mp3">If you were not going to finish on time, at least you could have let me know. 
Regardless, you knew how important this project was and you knew about the due date. 
What am I going to do with you?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B54/sentence/B54S7.mp3">You should have at least told me that you wouldn't be able to finish. 
Then I could have asked Mary to finish it. 
This is very irresponsible of you. 
Is this going to be a continual problem in future projects?</a>"

<h2>Business Trips</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/502-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you have a job that requires traveling or business trips, there are many things you need to know how to say. 
I recommend studying the Travelers Guide section I have for general traveling needs. 
But for this lesson, I am going to cover the things you need to say to the people you are traveling with and questions you need to ask about the business trip. 
Most of this lesson is primarily showing you a variety of questions you might need.

<b>Details</b>

When you go on a business trip, you will need to find out a lot of information.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S1.mp3">Where are we going for our business trip?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S2.mp3">Where are we going this time?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S3.mp3">What city are we traveling to?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S4.mp3">What is the objective for this business trip?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S5.mp3">What is our goal for this business trip?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S6.mp3">What do we want to accomplish for this business trip?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S7.mp3">What is the primary purpose for this business trip?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S8.mp3">What day are we departing for our business trip to Los Angeles?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S9.mp3">How long are we going to be there?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S10.mp3">How long is the business trip scheduled for?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S11.mp3">What time is ABC Company expecting us?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S12.mp3">Who should I report to when I get to ABC Company?</a>"

People who go on business trips get a daily allowance for food and other small necessities. 
This is called a per diem. 
The amount depends on the company, but you should ask how much you get a day.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S13.mp3">How much is the per diem?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S14.mp3">How much per diem do we get a day?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S15.mp3">How do we get the per diem?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S16.mp3">Isn't the per diem too low?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S17.mp3">What do they expect us to eat with this amount of per diem?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S18.mp3">Is the business trip really going to take us all five days?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S19.mp3">If we finish on the fourth day, can we come back early?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B55/sentence/B55S20.mp3">I think we can finish a day early. 
Can we come back on Thursday if we complete our work early?</a>"

<h2>First time business trip Q's</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/503-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If this is your first time on a business trip, then you will have even more questions. 
If you are not sure what to bring or how much stuff to bring, you can ask your manager or a co-worker.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S1.mp3">How much do you usually pack for a week long business trip?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S2.mp3">How big is the suitcase you take with you on a business trip?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S3.mp3">Do the hotels we stay at have a hair dryer?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S4.mp3">How many pieces of luggage do you bring with you on a business trip?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S5.mp3">Where do you usually park when you go to the airport?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S6.mp3">Is long term parking available at the airport?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S7.mp3">How early should I go to the airport?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S8.mp3">Where should we meet?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S9.mp3">Should we meet at the airport?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B56/sentence/B56S10.mp3">I missed my flight. 
The next flight they have available is in 45 minutes. 
I'll have to meet you at the airport in Los Angeles. 
I'll call you when I land.</a>"

<h2>Talking to people</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/504-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Talking to the employees of the company you are visiting is very different than talking to employees. 
Basically, you have to be polite and formal when dealing with them.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S1.mp3">Hi Mark, I'm Alex from ABC Consulting. 
It's nice to meet you.</a>"

During this stage, you might be engaged in small talk such as how your flight was or how the weather is over in your city, but if not, then you can get straight to work. 
You might need to know where you will be working. 
Only ask this if they never tell you. 
But chances are, they will let you know before you ask.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S2.mp3">Where will I be working this week?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S3.mp3">Where is your office located?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S4.mp3">Is your office relatively close to where I will be working?</a>"

You might need to ask who you will be working with. 
But again, don't ask this too early, you should give them a chance to answer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S5.mp3">Who will I be working with this week?</a>"

These previous questions should only be used in rare cases the other person doesn't tell you. 
The next couple of sentences are more likely.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S6.mp3">Who should I contact if I have a question regarding inaccurate data?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S7.mp3">Who should I contact if I have a question with this type of problem?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S8.mp3">I am going to be calling my manager frequently with critical updates. 
What phone should I use?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S9.mp3">How long does it take to get to the airport from here?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S10.mp3">How bad is the traffic around this time to the airport?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S11.mp3">Where is the closest place to eat around here?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S12.mp3">Is there a fast food restaurant near by?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S13.mp3">Does this building have a cafeteria?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B57/sentence/B57S14.mp3">Do you have a cafeteria close by?</a>"

<h2>Eating during the Business Trip</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/505-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you go on a business trip alone, then you don't need to talk much, and you can eat whenever you want. 
But if you go with a group, they might want to eat together. 
Some people like to eat together all the time, but some people might not want to eat because they are not hungry.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S1.mp3">What kind of food do you guys want to eat today?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S2.mp3">Anybody want to go for lunch?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S3.mp3">I'm going to lunch. 
Anybody want to join me?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S4.mp3">Let's go in 20 minutes. 
I have to finish this real quick.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S5.mp3">I can't make it. 
I have to finish this and it will take me another 30 minutes.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S6.mp3">I'm going to pass today. 
I brought a bagel with me.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S7.mp3">I have a small sandwich. 
I'm just going to eat here.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S8.mp3">Where should we have dinner tonight?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S9.mp3">Hey, let's go to the Italian restaurant next to the hotel.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B58/sentence/B58S10.mp3">We can either go to the steak house in the hotel, or the Italian restaurant next door.</a>"

<h2>Office and Cubicles</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/507-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The office has three types of workstation setting. 
Some companies provide a single office for each employee, other companies have a cubicle system, and some companies have desks put together in a large open space where everyone sits. 
I'll separate this lesson into these three categories.

<b>Desks all together</b>

If you are in an environment where you have to sit at a desk right next to 15 other people with the same desks, I'm sorry for your situation. 
It's very uncomfortable working like this, but it is a reality. 
Here are some things I heard from people in this setting.

General statements or complaints

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S1.mp3">It's not that bad, but there is no privacy.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S2.mp3">I wouldn't mind it so much if the manager couldn't see every minute of my day.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S3.mp3">I hate it. 
Even if they can't give us offices, they could at least give us cubicles.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S4.mp3">The reason I hate it so much is because I can't take a small break. 
Since the manager is always looking at everyone, even when I am not working, I have to pretend like I am.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S5.mp3">There are a lot of distractions. 
I can hear everything everyone says in the whole office.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S6.mp3">Mary sometimes turns on the music. 
It's not that bad, but sometimes I want it quiet.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S7.mp3">If I have a complaint about something, I can't talk to the manager because everyone will hear. 
I have to set up a meeting and use the conference room.</a>"

<b>Questions and Requests</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S8.mp3">I don't have another outlet near my desk. 
Can I get a power strip?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S9.mp3">Can I move to a different location? The sun always glares off my monitor and I have trouble working.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S10.mp3">Can I sit on the other side of the room? This is too close to the door and it gets cold here.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S11.mp3">I get hot easily. 
Would it be possible if I sit next to the door? It is much cooler there.</a>"

<h2>Cubicles</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/508-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

A cubicle is a work area that is separated by small portable walls. 
It is generally about 4 to 5 feet high and it gives a little more privacy. 
Although it's not as good as an office, it is much better than having to sit in an open area looking at everyone. 
Another benefit of having a cubicle is that you can personalize the space. 
There are small walls to put up pictures, decoration, or to put up a white board or a cork board.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S1.mp3">I sit in the cubicle down the hall. 
It's next to the conference room.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S2.mp3">My cubicle is directly on the other side of this wall. 
Come by sometime.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S3.mp3">The files are on my desk in my cubicle. 
I'll get them for you.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S4.mp3">I walked by your cubicle and saw a heater. 
Where did you get such a small one like that? I think I want one for my cubicle as well.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S5.mp3">There are a couple of people with the name Steve in our office. 
If you say, 'Steve' real loud, you will see two heads appear at the same time. 
It's quite funny.</a>"

If you hear the term 'cube farm', it is referring to a huge space with a lot of cubicles.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S6.mp3">I heard ABC Company has a serious cube farm. 
Even the CEO has a cubicle. 
I think that's pretty cool.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S7.mp3">How big is your cubicle?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S8.mp3">My cubicle is about 5 feet by 6 feet.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S9.mp3">It's roughly 5 by 6.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S10.mp3">I'm not sure, but it fits two small desks and a drawer. 
I guess it's big enough for me.</a>"

<h2>Office</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/509-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you think having an office will stop all your complaints and you will be happy, you are mistaken. 
It's amazing how people with their own office still find things to complain about. 
I am just as guilty. 
I remember when I was sharing an office with one other person, I was complaining about not having my own office. 
And when I got my own office, I remember complaining about getting a bigger office. 
When I got a bigger office, I remember complaining about not having a window office. 
Isn't it strange how the complaints never end? Let's see some of the sentences for this section.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S1.mp3">Why is Jack's office so much bigger than mine?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S2.mp3">I'm next in line for a window office. 
How come you gave it to Paul?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S3.mp3">There is an empty office across the hall. 
Can I have it?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S4.mp3">It's great having my own office because I can surf the Internet and take a real break anytime I want.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S5.mp3">The privacy is probably the best thing about having my own office. 
I can't image working in a cubicle again.</a>"

A common phrase you might hear from you manager is to come to their office.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S6.mp3">Can you stop by my office?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S7.mp3">Stop by my office when you get a chance.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S8.mp3">Let's meet in my office.</a>"

If you want to stop by someone's office, you can say this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S9.mp3">Can I stop by your office after lunch?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S10.mp3">Can I come by your office now?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B61/sentence/B61S11.mp3">Can we talk in your office?</a>"

<h2>Performance Review Period</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/511-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

A performance review period is a time when your manager reviews your work and tells you where you need to improve or where you have been doing well. 
Some smaller companies do not have a concrete review process. 
But large companies have a process in place. 
Some of them do a review two times a year, and some companies have a yearly review. 
Your review is sometimes dependent on how much raise you will get and sometimes even the bonus amount.

Because the review is different from company to company, I will use this lesson for sentences you need to say during the time you speak with your manager. 
I will not be going into the details and timeframe of the review.

If there is a process in place, then you probably have a template to write down your achievements over a certain time span. 
This is your chance to toot your own horn. 
So include everything you did and do not be modest. 
If you don't have a template to follow, then write down on a word document the achievements you made. 
It is also good to write down some places where you want to improve. 
Some people might think that telling your manager where you need to improve is basically admitting to having flaws, but great managers think a person who can identify their own problems and fix them are great employees.

<h2>Achievements</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/512-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Everyone has certain responsibilities. 
You should use your responsibilities as a guide when you talk to your boss. 
The best way is to go through each responsibility and state how you successfully accomplished everything you were responsible for.

If you are a sales person, then the best metric is to use your sales number.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S1.mp3">I have exceeded the average for all sales categories. 
I was in the top 3 for renewals, I was second in accessory sales, and the most in new services. 
Overall, I was the first in our store and third in the whole region.</a>"

If you are a computer engineer, then it will be a little different.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S2.mp3">I finished all my assignments on time, I fixed the most amount of code errors, I did code reviews on numerous occasion, and I created a program that helped the installation process. 
This ultimately reduced the installation time by 40%.</a>"

<b>Some General Statements</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S3.mp3">I feel I did a great job. 
I exceeded all my goals, and I made the most sales throughout the year.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S4.mp3">I am very happy with my performance over the year. 
I completed all my projects and I even took on three additional assignments. 
I also helped the junior employees on a regular basis.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S5.mp3">I'm happy with my results. 
The project I have been working on was a success. 
During the process, I managed to overcome all obstacles and finished on time. 
We have increased our revenue while decreasing cost.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S6.mp3">I believe I am on track. 
This year I have learned a great deal. 
I am very familiar with all our tools and I even completed my first project successfully.</a>"

These are general sentences you can say, but if you have a list of accomplishments, you should say them one by one in a paragraph. 
But make sure you speak clearly and slow enough so the other person can keep up.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B63/sentence/B63S7.mp3">I have accomplished a great deal this year. 
I analyzed all monthly sales data, wrote up a thorough report for each one, I also created a process of submitting the report form that saved an hour for each report, I worked on four projects that were all successful, and I created a How-To document for new employees.</a>"

This is long, but it is actually very simple. 
All I am doing is stating each thing right after the other. 
You should make a list and basically say them all together. 
It's effective and short.

<h2>Self Improvement</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/513-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are going to mention where you need improvement, it is very important to include how you are going to improve. 
This is similar to asking what is your weakness. 
If you mention a weakness, show them what steps you are taking to improve in that area. 
Finally, you must be certain it is ok to expose an area for improvement. 
I don't recommend doing this on your first review. 
After the first review, you will have a better idea if it will help to critique yourself.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B64/sentence/B64S1.mp3">I feel I need to be more technical. 
I realized how important it is to know different computer applications. 
In order to improve, I have researched some classes I can take, and I even bought a couple of books. 
In the next 3 months, I am going to concentrate on learning these new tools.</a>"

This is a good answer because it shows the manager that you are capable of finding your own faults. 
It also has a step by step process with a timeline on how you are going to improve.

Timeline is important because it shows that you are not going to procrastinate. 
If someone says, I'm going to read this book, you don't know when they are going to read it. 
It is much better when someone says they will read this book within 2 weeks.

Here is one more example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B64/sentence/B64S2.mp3">An area I would like to improve is in planning. 
I plan all my work and I complete everything on time, but I feel if I do a better job at planning, I can be more efficient with my time. 
In order to work on this, I created a checklist of everything I should think about before starting a project. 
Using this checklist will make me think of potential obstacles that I wouldn't normally think about, verify that I am not forgetting something, and keep me on track to complete ahead of time. 
I am going to do this and see how much it improves my efficiency for the next 2 projects. 
Afterwards, I'll report how much it helped or didn't help.</a>"

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/514-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Reviews are another time period where you get a raise and a bonus. 
If you work in a large company, then it will be hard to complain and get something changed. 
But if you work in a small company, you can ask for a larger raise. 
However, you must be in a position where the company will suffer if you leave the company. 
If you are replaceable, then the company doesn't have to give you a good raise. 
Just in case you are in one of these situations, here are some example sentences.

If you know you did more than anybody else, then here is a statement you can make to your manager.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S1.mp3">I have done more and better work than anybody else. 
I have learned everything on my own in the first three months without any training, and I have been a great employee. 
An 8 percent raise is not what I had in mind. 
I want a minimum 20 percent raise.</a>"

If they agree with you, then they might give you a larger raise, but they will question the 20 percent raise. 
You should know the average pay in your field and use that as ammunition.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S2.mp3">I agree that you have performed well, but 20 percent is a large raise. 
Where did you get that number from?</a>"

If you researched, then you can answer calmly with facts that your manager cannot disagree with.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S3.mp3">I have researched the pay for 5 different companies for someone with my experience and skill set. 
On average, they are being paid 25 percent more than me. 
I don't expect to get paid more than the other people because this is a smaller company, but I should get what I deserve and that is at least 20 percent.</a>"

If you have to go on frequent business trips, then you can include that as well.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S4.mp3">The average pay for workers who have to go on frequent business trips is significantly higher than what I am being paid. 
There is no overtime pay here and all the extra work is not compensated for. 
I feel it is fair to get a larger raise due to the amount of quality work I do and the frequent business trips required for this position.</a>"

Large companies have a process in place and most people will get a similar raise. 
If you get a small raise and you know you cannot fight for a larger raise, then you can at least ask what the average raise is.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S5.mp3">A three percent raise barely covers inflation. 
What was the average raise throughout the company?</a>"

Most of the time, the answer will be very similar to what you got.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S6.mp3">I did very well this year and exceeded all my goals. 
Why am I only receiving a four percent raise?</a>"

Sometimes even great employees will get a small raise in a large company. 
It might seem small, but if the company is struggling financially, they might not give anybody raises. 
Here is an example of what you might hear for the question above.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B65/sentence/B65S7.mp3">You actually got the maximum raise this year. 
Most of the people didn't get anything. 
Some people got a two percent raise. 
So you should actually be happy with your raise. 
The economy is down and the company needs to save money. 
They can't give large raises this year.</a>"

<h2>Quitting or Leaving Work</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/516-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When the time comes to leave work, you can do whatever you want. 
You can raise hell, say you hate everyone and yell out, 'I quit!!!' But in other cases when you want to leave professionally, you can use this lesson to help.

There's a common phrase when you are leaving a company. 
'Don't burn the bridge.'

This is basically saying you should leave on a good term. 
If you leave on a good note, then you have the option of coming back to the company or your position if something goes wrong with your next job. 
So basically, you are leaving the bridge back to your position.

If you are leaving because you have an offer from a different company, here are some professional statements you can make to your manager.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B66/sentence/B66S1.mp3">Hi Mark, I have a wonderful opportunity to work at a different company. 
I enjoyed my time here, but I shouldn't pass this up. 
I am putting in my two week notice.</a>"

Remember that in the States, changing job is very common. 
So it is no big deal when you leave a company. 
Businesses understand the need for change and realize that some people want different challenges in their life. 
So don't be nervous when you have to leave.

Giving a two week notice is standard. 
This gives your current employer the chance to hire someone to replace you. 
It also gives some time for you to finish the remaining work you have to do. 
Not giving a two week notice is one way to burn a bridge. 
The new company you are going into should realize this and will not expect you to start your job immediately if you have to give a two week notice. 
If you don't have a job, then this doesn't apply to you.

Here is another example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B66/sentence/B66S2.mp3">Hi Mark, unfortunately I have to tell you that I am leaving the company. 
I really enjoyed my time here and I appreciated all your help on my tasks. 
I have to put in my two week notice.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B66/sentence/B66S3.mp3">Hi Mark, I received an offer from a different company. 
This is a great opportunity for me so I accepted the offer. 
My decision on leaving is not because I didn't like my duties here. 
I really enjoyed my experience. 
But I am at a point where I want to find other challenges. 
I hope you can understand.</a>"

I have seen some people leave the company to go on a year trip around the world. 
Others I have seen just wanted to spend more time with their kids. 
I know in some countries it is hard to get back into a company after you leave, but in the States, if you are a good employee, it is easy to get their job back. 
Many times after a long break, they returned to the same company.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B66/sentence/B66S4.mp3">Mark, I have decided to leave the company. 
I have worked here for 10 years and I really enjoyed it. 
But I want to take a break and spend more time with my family. 
So I am putting in my two week notice.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B66/sentence/B66S5.mp3">Hi Mark, I have come to a decision to leave the company. 
I am going to travel for a year and this is the best time period for me to do so. 
I have always wanted to travel for an extended time period, and this is the only time I can do it. 
I can work for another month, so hopefully that should give you some time to find a replacement. 
And if you want, I can train the new employee on my areas.</a>"

<h2>Negotiating before Leaving</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/517-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Receiving a job offer is another way to negotiate a salary increase or a position change. 
If you are a great employee then your current employer might try to entice you to stay. 
If you are willing to stay, you can say that you received another offer and you are still thinking about it. 
If they try to make you stay, you can state what it will take for you to stay.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B67/sentence/B67S1.mp3">Hi Mark, I am at a crossroad in my career. 
I have recently interviewed with a different company and they extended an offer to me. 
I haven't decided yet, but I wanted to tell you before coming to a decision.</a>"

If at this time they ask you to stay, then you can ask for a couple of things.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B67/sentence/B67S2.mp3">If I didn't like this company, it would be an easy decision, but I really like it here. 
However, I have been asking to take on Program Management responsibilities here. 
Also, they are offering me a 6 percent higher salary than my current pay. 
Can anything be done about these two things?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B67/sentence/B67S3.mp3">Hi Mark, I have been thinking about moving back to my home town. 
I have a job lined up, but I haven't decided yet. 
I wanted to let you know before I make my final decision.</a>"

If they ask you to stay, you can say the following, but if they don't ask you to stay, then it is useless.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B67/sentence/B67S4.mp3">Well, they are offering me a higher salary. 
It's 7 percent higher than my current salary. 
Would it be possible for you guys to match this?</a>"

<h2>General Statements</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/518-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you talk to co-workers, you will eventually tell them that you are leaving. 
Here are some general sentences.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S1.mp3">Next Friday is my last day.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S2.mp3">I already put in my two week notice.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S3.mp3">I'm leaving the company.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S4.mp3">I accepted a job offer from ABC Company. 
This Friday will be my last day here.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S5.mp3">I'm leaving this dump.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S6.mp3">I would've left a lot sooner but I had to get a job lined up first.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S7.mp3">I got screwed here so many times. 
I don't want to work here anymore. 
My last day is this Friday.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S8.mp3">It was great working with you. 
I wish you the best on this project.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S9.mp3">I had a wonderful time here. 
I wish the best for you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S10.mp3">I really enjoyed working with you. 
I'll send you my personal email so keep in touch.</a>"

If someone else is leaving, then you can say something good like the example sentences below.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S11.mp3">I hope you enjoy your new job. 
Let me know if they have any other opening.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S12.mp3">Good luck in your new job. 
We'll keep your seat warm for you in case you want to return.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S13.mp3">Hey Jack, good luck with your new job and save me a seat.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/B68/sentence/B68S14.mp3">We'll miss you here. 
Good luck with your new career.</a>"

<h2>Greeting - Basic</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/520-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are many ways to greet someone. 
We'll learn about the most common way to greet someone in this lesson. 
I'll give a variety of example sentences.

Greeting someone you never met:
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S1.mp3">Hi, my name is Steve. 
It's nice to meet you.</a>"
You can respond to this by saying,
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S2.mp3">It's a pleasure to meet you. 
I'm Jack.</a>"

Another common question to ask is

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S3.mp3">What do you do for a living?</a>"

You can respond to this by saying, 

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S4.mp3">I work at a restaurant.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S5.mp3">I work at a bank.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S6.mp3">I work in a software company.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S7.mp3">I'm a dentist.</a>"

Usually, you will not need to ask for a name. 
It is implied that each person should say their name. 
But in case they don't, you can ask, 

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S8.mp3">What is your name?</a>"

Many times, I don't hear the name. 
If you would like for them to repeat their name, you can say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S9.mp3">What was that again?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S10.mp3">Excuse me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L1/sentence/L1S11.mp3">Pardon me?</a>"

<h2>Greeting Someone you Know</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/521-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S1.mp3">Hey John, how have you been?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S2.mp3">Hi Bob, how are you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S3.mp3">Hi Nancy, what have you been up to?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S4.mp3">Andy, it's been a long time, how are you man?</a>"

If you meet someone unexpectedly, you can say,
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S5.mp3">Hey Jack, it's good to see you. 
What are you doing here?</a>"
or
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S6.mp3">What a surprise. 
I haven't seen you in a long time. 
How have you been?</a>"

If you see the person at a restaurant, you can say, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S7.mp3">Do you come to this restaurant often?</a>"
Or at the movie theater, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S8.mp3">What movie did you come to see?</a>"

<b>Appropriate responses:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S9.mp3">Hi Steve, my name is Mike. 
It is nice to meet you as well.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S10.mp3">I heard a lot about you from John. 
He had a lot of good things to say.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S11.mp3">Wow. 
How long has it been? It seems like more than a year. 
I'm doing pretty well. 
How about you?</a>"

A typical response to this type of greeting is simple.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S12.mp3">Not too bad.</a>"

If asked what you have been up to, you can respond with, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S13.mp3">Same ole same ole.</a>" Or, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S14.mp3">The same as usual.</a>"

Here are some other example responses.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S15.mp3">I'm pretty busy at work these days, but otherwise, everything is great.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S16.mp3">I'm doing very well.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L2/sentence/L2S17.mp3">I finally have some free time.

<h2>Bored - General Phrases</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/524-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Being bored means having nothing to do. 
When someone is bored, they often call people and try to entertain themselves or try to find something to do with a friend. 
So being bored is a good starting point for conversational English.

There are a couple of situations you can express to someone that you are bored. 
Most commonly, you will call a friend and tell them that you are bored or ask them to do something together. 
The other time is when someone asks you how you are doing. 
We will cover both situations in this session.

<h2>Bored - Calling Someone</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/525-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The conversation when you call someone might sound something like this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S1.mp3">Hello.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S2.mp3">Hi Jane, this is Jill. 
Do you have time to talk?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S3.mp3">Hi Jill, sure, I was just watching TV.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S4.mp3">What are you watching?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S5.mp3">I was just watching a re-run of friends. 
How about you? What are you doing?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S6.mp3">Nothing much. 
I really wanted to start studying for the Psychology test coming up, but I can't seem to motivate myself.</a>"

As you can see, Even though Jill is very bored, she didn't say that she was bored. 
To sensitive people, they can misinterpret the situation. 
If I am bored and I call you, then that could mean that I am only calling you because I have nothing better to do. 
So if you are not very close friends, it is better to say something like, 'nothing much' instead of 'I am bored.'

If you are very close friends with someone, then the conversation can be more direct and honest.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S7.mp3">What are you doing?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S8.mp3">I'm doing the laundry.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S9.mp3">I'm so bored. 
I have nothing to do.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S10.mp3">Why don't you come over and help me with the laundry?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S11.mp3">I'd rather do my own house chores. 
Hey, you wanna take a break from your house work and have coffee at Starbucks with me?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L5/sentence/L5S12.mp3">Sure, that sounds great. 
I'll meet you there in thirty minutes.</a>"

<h2>Bored - Boring Work</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/526-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

A different situation you can tell someone you are bored is when you are simply talking with a friend concerning a part of your life that is boring. 
For example, if you have a boring job, you can explain to your friend how boring it is.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S1.mp3">How is your work these days?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S2.mp3">Work is so boring that I'm going crazy.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S3.mp3">I ran out of things to do and management is too busy to give me more work. 
I tried to find things to do with no luck. 
I'm basically sitting in my chair pretending to work.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S4.mp3">That sounds so boring.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S5.mp3">Tell me about it. 
Time goes so slow when you're bored. 
I'd rather be busy. 
Then at least the day would go by faster.</a>"

Similar type of boring work is when doing something that is routine. 
Some sentences expressing boring work are:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S6.mp3">I'm doing the same thing over and over again.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S7.mp3">My work is so repetitious that I am getting bored of it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S8.mp3">My work does not interest me.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S9.mp3">I'm only working to pay the bills.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S10.mp3">I wish I had your job.</a>"

Because some people are so busy, they envy people who have nothing to do at work.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S11.mp3">I'm so bored. 
I have nothing to do at work. 
I just surf the Internet all day long.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L6/sentence/L6S12.mp3">Dang! I'm so busy at work, it's driving me crazy. 
I really wish I had your job.</a>"

<h2>How is your Day - General Statements</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/528-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this lesson, we are going to learn how to communicate to someone using the present tense. 
However, because this isn't a site teaching grammar, I do not want to spend too much time on details. 
I wanted to include this section primarily to show many different sentences using present tense and to have a dedicated practice section with only present tense sentences.

This lesson is a little shorter than others because speaking in the present tense is not as common as speaking in the future or past tense. 
Although speaking in the future tense or the past tense is more common, it is still important to know how to communicate in the present tense. 
Here are some example sentences:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S1.mp3">I see Bob over there by the newspaper stand.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S2.mp3">I'm going to the library.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S3.mp3">I'm on my way home.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S4.mp3">I'm going to the bus stop.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S5.mp3">Jack is going to the store.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S6.mp3">Jill is stopping by now.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S7.mp3">The meeting is starting now.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S8.mp3">The manager is waiting for you in her office.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S9.mp3">Tell the receptionist that you are here to see Mr. 
Hwang.</a>"

<b>Questions:</b>

A very common question you will run into is, 
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S10.mp3">How are you doing?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S11.mp3">How is your day going?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S12.mp3">What are you doing now?</a>"

To answer these types of question, you must remember that you are talking about what is currently going on now, so you must use the present tense.

Here are some ways to answer the above question.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S13.mp3">I'm enjoying the beautiful weather without any worries in the world.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S14.mp3">I'm playing a video game on my computer because I have nothing to do.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S15.mp3">I'm at the grocery store buying ingredients for tonight's dinner.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S16.mp3">I'm at the gym working out.</a>"

As you can see, each sentence is starting with, 'I am' instead of 'I will be' or 'I was.' We will discuss past tense and future tense in the next sessions.

More descriptive answers you can give are the following:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S17.mp3">I'm pretty busy right now. 
I'm doing my homework because I have an exam tomorrow.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S18.mp3">My project deadline is coming up, so I'm currently in the process of finishing my tasks.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S19.mp3">I'm taking the day off from work today because I have so many errands. 
I'm going to the post office to send some packages to my friends.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S20.mp3">I'm looking for a job. 
The job market does not look that great, but I can't give up.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S21.mp3">I'm applying for a job at a consulting firm in Taiwan.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L7/sentence/L7S22.mp3">I'm listening to music while thinking about my situation.</a>"

<h2>How is your day - Example Conversation</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/529-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The present tense is more common in writing. 
As you can see by all the explanations I am giving, they are all written in the present tense. 
That is because it is instructional. 
Instructional writing is more commonly written in present tense. 
However, stories in novels are written in past tense.

The reason past and future tense is used more commonly than present tense when speaking is because usually you are telling someone what you have done or what you plan on doing. 
Speaking in the present tense is used primarily to tell someone what you are currently doing.

As in previous lessons in 'Bored and Greeting' it is very common to have a conversation using the present tense when you run into somebody or when you make or receive a phone call.

Let's use this time now to incorporate what we have learned so far.

Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S1.mp3">Hi Jack. 
What are you doing?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S2.mp3">Hi Mary. 
I'm filling out a job application.</a>"
Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S3.mp3">Are you finished with school already?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S4.mp3">No.

Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S5.mp3">How is your day going?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S6.mp3">Quite busy. 
I'm preparing for my presentation tomorrow on our marketing strategy. 
I'm not even half done yet.</a>"
Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S7.mp3">You must feel stressed out now.</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S8.mp3">That's an understatement.</a>"

Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S9.mp3">What are you doing now?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S10.mp3">I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool hall.</a>"
Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S11.mp3">I didn't know you play pool. 
Are you having fun?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S12.mp3">I'm having a great time. 
How about you? What are you doing?</a>"
Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S13.mp3">I'm taking a break from my homework. 
There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do.</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L8/sentence/L8S14.mp3">I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.</a>"

<h2>Tomorrow's Plan - I am going to</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/531-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Talking about the future is something that is done very frequently. 
Whether we are talking about our dreams or simply telling someone what we will do tomorrow is all spoken in the future tense. 
As in the previous lesson, this isn't a grammar lesson. 
This lesson is to provide many different sentences using the future tense.

In the previous lesson, we concentrated on present tense using 'I am'

When we speak in the future tense, we can still use 'I am' but it is important what follows the two words that will make it future tense. 
Here are a couple of examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S1.mp3">I'm going to see Bob tomorrow.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S2.mp3">I'm going to meet John at the airport at 6 O'clock tonight.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S3.mp3">I'm going to go home in an hour.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S4.mp3">I'm going to go to the bus stop right after class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S5.mp3">I'm going to do that tomorrow.</a>"

When using 'going to' after 'I am' it is important that a future indicator is present. 
For example, if I say, 'I am going to meet John', this can also be present tense that we practiced previously. 
But if you add a future indicator like 'at 6 O'clock tonight' then it becomes future tense.

Other future tense indicators are:

'going to go'
'going to be'
'I will'
'I have to'

Let's practice using these words:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S6.mp3">I'm going to be dead if I don't finish this project by tomorrow.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S7.mp3">I'm going to go home next week.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S8.mp3">I'll meet you there at five.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L9/sentence/L9S9.mp3">I can't go tonight because I have to work late.</a>"

<h2>Yesterday - The Past - General Statements</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/535-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In daily conversation, talking about the past is done very frequently. 
Whenever you meet a friend, you always tell each other what you have been doing recently. 
Friends are always interested in each other so they want to know how you have been spending your time in the past.

Today's lesson is going to target past tense communication. 
This goes hand in hand with the last two lessons and changing a few words around can make a future or present tense sentence into a past tense sentence.

To begin, here are a couple of sentences that are common to say:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S1.mp3">I went to the airport yesterday.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S2.mp3">I met Bob last week.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S3.mp3">I was an hour late for my meeting.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S4.mp3">I went to the bus stop, but I was 30 seconds late. 
A person on the street told me the bus just went by.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S5.mp3">I completed that task this morning.</a>"

Speaking in the past requires past tense words. 
Let's take a closer examination for the sentences above.

As you can see by some of the examples in the chart, some words change when speaking in the past tense.

Besides some words that change, many times a word with the letter 'd' or 'ed' at the end changes the word to past tense. 
Here are some examples:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S6.mp3">I was being polite so I opened the door for him.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S7.mp3">I stapled the papers together to keep them organized.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S8.mp3">The paper ripped on the bottom, so I taped them together.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S9.mp3">I switched the presents around because I found out Jane doesn't like red lipstick.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S10.mp3">I was very interested in the topic so I paid close attention.</a>"

The tricky part is to know when to add a 'd' to the end of a word to make it past tense. 
There are exceptions that can cause confusion, for example,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S11.mp3">I rode my bike to school.</a>" It would be incorrect to say, 'I rided...'
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S12.mp3">I built the house from scratch.</a>" Incorrect way is to say, 'I builded...'
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L12/sentence/L12S13.mp3">I sat on the chair next to the emergency exit.</a>" Incorrect way is to say, 'sitted...'

So remember to use past tense words correctly or the other person might not understand what you are saying.

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/536-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When asking questions about the past, you can ask questions like:

<h2>Weather - Summer and Autumn</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/540-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this section, we will learn about the four different seasons along with the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
Also, we will learn about weather in different parts of the world. 
In the next session, we will practice more dialog. 
But this is a good starting point when learning to hold a conversation about the weather.

<b>Summer:</b>

Depending on the location, summer can be warm and pleasant or unbearably hot and humid. 
Although you will describe summer in one particular way, you should be aware of how other people describe summer in different parts of the world.

In Nevada, Arizona, Egypt, or other places that are like deserts, people might say,
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S1.mp3">Summer is very hot and dry. 
It's not so bad when we are in the shade.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S2.mp3">Summer is extremely hot. 
The sun will burn you if you don't wear sunscreen.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S3.mp3">Because it's not humid, it is easy to get used to.</a>"

In Seattle, the summer is the best season,
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S4.mp3">Summer is the only time of year that it doesn't rain much.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S5.mp3">Summer is like paradise in Seattle.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S6.mp3">If summer wasn't so good here, I would move to a different city.</a>"

In New York, Korea, or other hot and humid places, people can say,
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S7.mp3">Summer is both hot and humid here.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S8.mp3">I am always sticky because I sweat so much during the summer.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S9.mp3">Without air conditioning, I don't know how I would survive.</a>"

<b>Spring and Fall / Autumn</b>

From my perception, I noticed that spring and autumn are generally pleasant seasons for many areas of the world. 
I haven't heard enough to say one way or another, so I can only write down what I know.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S10.mp3">My favorite season is autumn.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S11.mp3">The only reason I don't like the fall is due to all the leaves I have to rake up.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S12.mp3">Fall is so beautiful because of all the different color leaves everywhere.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S13.mp3">It rains a lot around here during the fall.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S14.mp3">It gets cold in late autumn.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S15.mp3">In our country, autumn is just like summer. 
It's hot and humid.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S16.mp3">My favorite season is spring because of the budding flowers.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S17.mp3">I love the spring because it's not cold nor hot.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L15/sentence/L15S18.mp3">The spring season here causes a lot of people to sneeze due to all the flowers appearing. 
Many people with allergies hate the spring.</a>"

<h2>Weather - Winter</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/541-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Winter has many differences between locations. 
Some places might be extremely cold like Korea, New York, Alaska, Greenland, etc, and some places might be perfect like Hawaii, Los Angeles, Mexico and other hot places.

<b>Hot places that enjoy pleasant summer warmth:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S1.mp3">I don't think we have a winter here. 
During the winter months, it's still 80 degrees. 
So everyone loves the winter months because it's not too hot.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S2.mp3">Winter time is the best time to visit because the temperature is the best during January.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S3.mp3">I like to go to Hawaii for my winter vacations because it's so cold in my home city.</a>"

<b>Cold places:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S4.mp3">It's freezing out.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S5.mp3">It doesn't snow often, but when it does, it stays around for several weeks because it stays cold.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S6.mp3">For 3 months, this city will be covered with a layer of snow because it will never melt.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S7.mp3">It doesn't get too cold here, but it's always raining and very gloomy.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L16/sentence/L16S8.mp3">The winter here is cold and dry. 
We hardly get any precipitation.</a>"

<h2>Weather - Fahrenheit and Celsius</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/542-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

It's unfortunate that some countries still use the Fahrenheit system. 
It would be so much easier if everything was in Celsius. 
But because the United States still uses the Fahrenheit system, knowing the conversion of Celsius to Fahrenheit will help when speaking to Americans.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S1.mp3">How do you convert Fahrenheit to Celsius?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S2.mp3">Well, you subtract 32 from Fahrenheit, multiply by 5 and then divide by 9.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S3.mp3">How do you convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S4.mp3">You multiply Celsius by 9, divide by 5, then add 32.</a>"

Here is an example dialog.

Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S5.mp3">What is the average temperature in Seoul during June?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S6.mp3">It is usually about 26 degrees Celsius during June.</a>"
Person A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S7.mp3">What is that in Fahrenheit?</a>"
Person B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S8.mp3">That would be about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</a>"

Usually, it takes some time to convert degrees using the conversion method. 
So it's easier to have general temperatures already memorized. 
Here is a small table so you can quickly respond when talking with a foreigner about the temperature.

You don't need to remember everything. 
But if you know a couple of numbers you can just change the other number slightly. 
For example, if you know that 80 degrees is about 27 degrees Celsius, then if the temperature is 77 degrees, you can figure that it will be about 25 degrees Celsius. 
Also, you don't have to be very accurate. 
In conversation, many people just want general numbers and being off by a half a degree will not do any harm.

Finally, during the winter months, it gets so cold that the temperature goes below 0 degrees Celsius. 
Let's practice a few sentences using negative numbers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S9.mp3">How cold does it usually get in Korea?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S10.mp3">Usually around minus 5 degrees Celsius, but sometimes it gets as cold as minus 12 degrees.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S11.mp3">How cold does it get in Alaska?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S12.mp3">Depending on the area, but it's common for the temperature to be below 0.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S13.mp3">Is that in Fahrenheit or Celsius?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S14.mp3">Fahrenheit.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L17/sentence/L17S15.mp3">That means it's 20 below zero!</a>"

Remember, although numbers below zero are negative numbers, it's not common to say, 'Negative 2 degrees.' It's not wrong to say it and everyone will understand, however, when speaking to many people, almost everyone says 'minus 2 degrees.' Another common way to say it is below zero is to say, '2 below' as in the example above.

<h2>Weather - Questions and Answers</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/543-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this session, we are primarily going to practice speaking key sentences that will help you carry a conversation about the weather.

<b>Asking about the weather:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S1.mp3">Do you know what the weather will be like tomorrow?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S2.mp3">Do you know if it's going to rain tomorrow?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S3.mp3">Did you see the weather forecast?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S8.mp3">What is your favorite season of the year?</a>"

<b>Answering questions about the weather:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S9.mp3">The weather is supposed to be sunny and warm tomorrow.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S10.mp3">It's supposed to rain for the next several days.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S11.mp3">I didn't see the news yesterday so I don't know what the weather is going to be like.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S12.mp3">Weather in Los Angeles is usually hot in the summer and mild in the winter. 
It never really gets that cold.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S13.mp3">The weather in Pusan is very similar to Seoul. 
The main difference is that Seoul gets a little more snow in the winter and a little hotter in the summer. 
This is primarily because Pusan is right next to the water.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S14.mp3">My favorite season of the year is Spring. 
It's not too cold and the anticipation of a good summer puts me in a good mood.</a>"

<b>Statements about the weather:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S15.mp3">I heard Seattle is a very gloomy city with so many clouds.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S24.mp3">I hate the snow.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L18/sentence/L18S27.mp3">Korea has four distinct seasons.</a>"

<h2>Weather - Long Description</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/544-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Being able to speak specific sentences is good, however, it is more important to be able to say a whole paragraph when talking about topics such as the weather. 
I'll have a specific lesson about putting sentences together in a future lesson. 
But I'll give one advice now. 
Basically, make about 10 sentences. 
After you know your ten sentences about this question, you can say all of them one after the other so it is a long answer. 
The ten sentences should be in a list format.

We will learn how to speak longer in a future lesson, but if you want to give it a try now, here are two examples.

Question: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L19/sentence/L19S1.mp3">What is the weather like in Korea?</a>"
Answer: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L19/sentence/L19S2.mp3">Well, the weather in Korea is unique with four distinct seasons. 
In the winter, the temperature is about zero degrees Celsius. 
But, because it doesn't rain much in the winter, there isn't much snow and the air is very dry. 
In spring, the days warm up significantly but the night gets a little chilly. 
The summer has two characteristics. 
It is very hot and humid most of the time, and for about 3 weeks or so, we have a rainy season called monsoon. 
It gets very rainy and windy during that time period. 
But we all look forward to autumn. 
It is a beautiful time of year and the temperature is very pleasant. 
If you plan on visiting Korea, I highly recommend visiting during autumn.</a>"

Question: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L19/sentence/L19S3.mp3">Which season do you like the most?</a>"
Answer: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L19/sentence/L19S4.mp3">I like summer the most, but at the same time, I hate it. 
I like summer because it's warm. 
I don't mind the heat and I like the longer days. 
So, I can do more activities like swimming, bicycling, rollerblading, and many other outdoor activities. 
I usually take a short vacation during the summer so I always look forward to that. 
However, the part about summer I hate the most is during the monsoon season. 
I can tolerate the humidity, but when it gets hot and humid along with the rain and the wind, then it gets terrible.</a>"

<h2>Small Talk</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/546-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Many people believe small talk is very boring and not personable. 
Although that is true, there are many places where small talk is very important. 
In the western culture, strangers talk to other strangers frequently. 
On the other hand, small talk is not so common in the eastern culture. 
Because strangers are friendly to one another in the western culture, small talk is very important to master in regards to learning English. 
One other place small talk is important is in an interview. 
That is why this session will be important to learn.

The best way to learn small talk is to provide many examples. 
So this lesson will be taught using an example format.

Small talk involves many different topics. 
We will have several sessions on small talk once we have covered other subjects such as sports, jobs, school, etc. 
But for now, we will go through the basics of small talk conversation. 
To initiate small talk, we can use what we have learned from our previous several sessions:

One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S1.mp3">Hi Bill, how are you doing?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S2.mp3">I'm doing great. 
How are you doing?</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S3.mp3">I'm doing well myself.</a>"

Wasn't that simple? If you studied the material in prior sessions, this should be real easy for you. 
Now that we have initiated the small talk, it's your responsibility to keep the conversation going. 
In order to do so, you can talk about anything that is not too personal. 
Let's first ask what the other person has been doing lately.

One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S4.mp3">What have you been up to lately?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S5.mp3">Well, I just started to work at the bank so I'm pretty busy learning everything.</a>"

You can elaborate on what you have learned to keep the conversation alive. 
In this example, you are going to ask more questions about school and work.

One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S6.mp3">Does that mean you already finished school? I thought you had 1 more semester left.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S7.mp3">I took summer courses, so I finished one semester early.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S8.mp3">It's great that you got a job. 
I'm really happy for you.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S9.mp3">Thanks.</a>"

As you can now tell, the conversation is getting old. 
You have a choice of ending the conversation, or changing the topic. 
Let's practice ending the conversation.

One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S10.mp3">We should get together for lunch sometime.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S11.mp3">Yeah, that would be great.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S12.mp3">I'll call you sometime.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S13.mp3">Ok. 
I'll see you later.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L20/sentence/L20S14.mp3">Alright. 
See ya.</a>"

<h2>Small Talk - Two Example Dialogs</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/547-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this conversation, we initiated the conversation and talked about the other person. 
However, sometimes you will not have anything to talk about. 
In order to keep the conversation alive, you should think about topics such as the weather.

One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S1.mp3">Hi Mary.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S2.mp3">Oh, hi.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S3.mp3">How are you doing?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S4.mp3">I'm doing alright. 
How about you?</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S5.mp3">Not too bad. 
The weather is great isn't it?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S6.mp3">Yes. 
It's absolutely beautiful today.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S7.mp3">I wish it was like this more frequently.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S8.mp3">Me too.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S9.mp3">So where are you going now?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S10.mp3">I'm going to meet a friend of mine at the department store.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S11.mp3">Going to do a little shopping?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S12.mp3">Yeah, I have to buy some presents for my parents.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S13.mp3">What's the occasion?</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S14.mp3">It's their anniversary.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S15.mp3">That's great. 
Well, you better get going. 
You don't want to be late.</a>"
Two: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S16.mp3">I'll see you next time.</a>"
One: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S17.mp3">Sure. 
Bye.</a>"

This example is when you run into someone. 
This is an easy type of small talk because when you run out of things to say, you can always say bye. 
There are times when you don't have that option. 
Let's practice a situation where you cannot leave, such as an interview. 
I go into depth about interview communication in a different section. 
For now, I am going to emphasize the small talk portion of an interview. 
There are times when you will not have an opportunity for small talk, but in other cases, you might have to talk about general things.

Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S18.mp3">Hi. 
My name is Josh. 
It's a pleasure to meet you.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S19.mp3">Hi Josh. 
I'm glad to be here.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S20.mp3">Did you have any problems finding this place.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S21.mp3">I didn't have any problems. 
I found directions on the internet so it was pretty easy to find. 
However, the traffic was not that great.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S22.mp3">Traffic is never good around here.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S23.mp3">I agree. 
It would be great if there was a train or a subway line that went through here.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S24.mp3">That would be so great. 
I would definitely take the train if they had it.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S25.mp3">Trains are great because you can read a book or get a little rest instead of having to fight the traffic.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S26.mp3">Very true. 
Well, let me begin by telling you about our company...</a>"

This is a good example of small talk. 
It shows that you are easy to speak with, and most importantly, you found a small connection even though it was about a small topic such as the traffic problem. 
In this type of situation, don't feel that you have to constantly talk. 
If it is not relevant to the topic, it might be better not to say anything. 
But if you can add on to the topic, it's a good thing. 
The person who is giving the interview has the control, and that person will direct the small talk to the interview when the time is right. 
In my example above, I made a small transition from the traffic and started the interview process. 
If you are interested about interview, please go to the Interview Section. 
You may now move on to the practice session.

<h2>Movies - Asking Friend</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/557-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this section we will work on the planning aspect of watching a movie. 
In other Movie sections, we will cover discussing a movie, types of movies, etc.

Since this is the first Movie section, let me take a quick minute to explain how to find out movie times and how to pay for tickets in America. 
It's very similar and simple.

First, you need to find out what time a show is playing. 
In most cases, this is done by checking the internet. 
Usually, you type in the zip code and all the theaters in that area will display all the movies and movie times for that week. 
After you have chosen the movie to see, you need to buy the ticket. 
There are some places you can buy on-line, but it isn't that popular yet. 
You can go to the theater before the movie starts and buy it at the theater. 
The only thing you need to know how to say is the movie name and the movie time. 
Here is a quick example. 
Let's say you are watching the Titanic at 3:00. You walk up to the counter and say, 'Titanic. 
Three o'clock.' Wasn't that easy? Finally, big block buster movies usually sell out of tickets very quickly. 
So if you want to see it on opening day, it is wise to go to the theater right when it opens and buy the tickets in advance.

Before you watch a movie, you need to plan ahead with friends. 
Either you are asking a friend to watch a movie, or you are answering. 
In either case, we will cover it here.

The following questions and statements are used when asking a friend to watch a movie.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S1.mp3">Hey John, do you want to (wanna) go see a movie tonight?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S2.mp3">I'm going to watch Terminator 2. Do you wanna join?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S3.mp3">Let's go see The Matrix tomorrow.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S4.mp3">What time should we meet at the theater?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S5.mp3">Let's watch a movie after dinner.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S6.mp3">The Titanic is coming out this Friday. 
Let's go see it.</a>"

If there are not enough details, a response can be in a question form. 
Here are a couple of examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S7.mp3">Who is all going?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S8.mp3">Who are you watching it with?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S9.mp3">Where are you watching it?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S10.mp3">What time are you watching the movie?</a>"

Normal answers:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S11.mp3">That sounds great.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S12.mp3">I always wanted to see that. 
Let's go.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S13.mp3">Let's meet at the theater at four o'clock.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S14.mp3">Sure. 
Do you wanna eat lunch together before the movie?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S15.mp3">I've already seen that movie. 
What else is playing?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S16.mp3">I can't. 
I have to work that night.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S17.mp3">That movie sounds scary. 
I don't like horror movies.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L22/sentence/L22S18.mp3">I really don't like the actors. 
I'm going to pass.</a>"

But for now, let's work on movie types.

There are many different types of movies. 
You probably know them all in your language, but let's learn what they are in English. 
Also, we will learn how to say a couple of sentences related to a movie type. 
If you disagree with a sentence, feel free to change some words around so they fit what you want to say.

Although there are many categories, we will learn the most basic 10 types of movies.

Action
Drama
Comedy
Romantic comedy
Horror
Science fiction
Suspense (Thriller)
Western
Commentary / Non-Fiction

<b>Action:</b> Movies with lots of fighting, shooting, exploding, etc.

<h2>Movie Discussion - General Statements</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/564-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this movie section, we are going to have discussions about movies that we already saw. 
This is useful because whenever we come out of a movie theater, we always ask our friends what we thought about the movie. 
Sometimes, it's a simple answer such as, 'It was alright.' But sometimes, a good discussion can arise from a great movie. 
Let's get started...

Every time I finish watching a movie, I either ask someone, or someone asks me, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S1.mp3">What did you think about the movie?</a>" For the most part, the answer is a simple one line sentence:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S2.mp3">It was alright.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S3.mp3">It could have been better.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S4.mp3">It was pretty good.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S5.mp3">I liked it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S6.mp3">It was entertaining.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S7.mp3">It was so stupid I almost fell asleep.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S8.mp3">Lame.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S9.mp3">Boring.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S10.mp3">Too unrealistic.</a>"

I can go on for a long time describing movies. 
I have listed a few so you get an idea how to answer simple movie questions.

Besides simple one line answers, there are a few reasons we need to say other things. 
It is because either we didn't understand something, want to describe a scene we liked, want to describe a scene that was stupid, or simply go on and on about how great the movie was.

<h2>Movie Discussion - Describing a Movie</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/565-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Didn't understand:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S1.mp3">Do you remember the scene when Mary walked into the dining room? Why was she carrying a knife? She didn't use it and the cameras focused on it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S2.mp3">I can't understand why she betrayed him. 
The whole movie concentrated on her trust and loyalty. 
It just doesn't make sense.</a>"

<b>Good Scene:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S3.mp3">I love the scene when Russell Crowe showed his face to the emperor after the first gladiator fight.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S4.mp3">What did you think about the last fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in the rain?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S5.mp3">The courtroom scene between Jodie Foster and Richard Gere was absolutely amazing.</a>"

<b>Great Movie:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S6.mp3">That was such a cool movie. 
It was the best movie I've seen in a long time.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S7.mp3">Anytime I see a great movie I tend to look at my watch often. 
That's because I don't want the movie to end.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S8.mp3">The movie was great. 
I liked everything about it. 
I'm definitely going to buy the dvd.</a>"

<b>Situational questions:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S9.mp3">What would you have done? Would you have taken the million dollars and give up your wife for a night?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S10.mp3">Would you choose money and fame, or family and stability?</a>"

Some movies are known to be 'based on a true story.' These types of movies are very interesting because they actually happened. 
The only reason they are not considered to be a non-fiction movie is because the director or writer will add some scenes that didn't happen, or change some facts around so the movie is more appealing to the masses.

A conversation can start from movies such as Schindler's List. 
When coming out of a theater, I heard a couple talk briefly about this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S11.mp3">What did you think about the movie?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S12.mp3">I thought it was great. 
It was very powerful.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S13.mp3">How much of it do you think was true?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S14.mp3">I learned about Germany and World War II in one of my classes, and this movie showed everything I learned from class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L28/sentence/L28S15.mp3">Wow. 
It's amazing that these things have happened in our history.</a>"

<h2>Movie Discussion - Example Dialog</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/566-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

As of this writing, the latest movie I saw was The Last Samurai. 
After the movie, I had a meal with a couple of people. 
We had a good discussion due to this movie. 
It is difficult to specifically teach what you will need to know about movie conversations because every movie will require different words and sentences. 
The only thing I can do here is to give ideas and couple of examples about movie conversations. 
So this is not really going to be a practice section, but a chance to hear a real conversation from a movie. 
You can click on each individual sentence, or you can click on the link provided below to hear a real life conversation.

<b><i><a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S1.mp3">Listen to the conversation</a></i></b>

A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S2.mp3">Did you like the movie?</a>"
B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S3.mp3">It was better than I thought.</a>"
C: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S4.mp3">I liked it.</a>"
A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S5.mp3">The movie didn't have many cheesy or stupid scenes.</a>"
B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S6.mp3">Yeah. 
I'm glad that they didn't have any love scenes. 
Sometimes a love scene destroys a good movie.</a>"
C: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S7.mp3">I thought the scene where the girl was washing her hair and Tom Cruise came to say good bye was stupid. 
Why did they have that there? It didn't make sense.</a>"
B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S8.mp3">I agree. 
They didn't need that scene.</a>"
A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S9.mp3">I don't see the harm in that scene. 
They didn't do anything or show anything. 
What's the big deal?</a>"
C: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S10.mp3">When you are talking about good movies versus great movies, each and every scene counts.</a>"
A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S11.mp3">That's true.</a>"
B: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S12.mp3">But besides those one or two scenes, the movie was great.</a>"
A: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S13.mp3">I liked everything about it. 
I really liked the samurai that was beating up Cruise in the beginning of the movie. 
The guy second in command. 
He was cool too.</a>"

<h2>Favorite - What's your Favorite</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/567-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The word favorite is used a lot in spoken English. 
It is very common to talk about your favorite things with your friends or acquaintances. 
Topics can range from favorite movies, favorite TV shows, favorite food, favorite cars, etc. 
Since there are so many favorite things in the world, you should pay close attention to this lesson.

Asking questions is the most common way to use the word favorite:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S1.mp3">Who is your favorite singer?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S2.mp3">Who is your favorite person?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S3.mp3">Who is your favorite athlete?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S4.mp3">Who was your favorite ex-girlfriend?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S5.mp3">Who was your favorite elementary teacher?</a>"

Are you following me? It's very easy. 
Just change the word at the end and you can make dozens of sentences.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S6.mp3">What is your favorite show?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S7.mp3">What is your favorite movie?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S8.mp3">What is your favorite dessert?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S9.mp3">What is your favorite program?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S10.mp3">What is your favorite class?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S11.mp3">What is your favorite game?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S12.mp3">What was the title of your favorite song?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S13.mp3">What was the name of your favorite sit-com?</a>"

We used 'who' and 'what' in our sentences. 
It's possible to use 'where', 'how', and 'when', but the most common is 'what' and 'who'.

I'll provide a couple of sentences for the other words.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S14.mp3">Where is your favorite vacation spot?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S15.mp3">When is your favorite time of day?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S16.mp3">How is your favorite noodles cooked?</a>"

It's not common, because even though it is grammatically incorrect, you can ask the same question with 'what'

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S17.mp3">What is your favorite vacation spot?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L30/sentence/L30S18.mp3">What is your favorite time of day?</a>"

Nobody is really going to notice and it's not a big deal. 
After this lesson is over, I suggest practicing with 'what' and 'who', but don't bother with the others. 
It's not as important.

<h2>Favorite - Answering Questions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/568-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

To answer these types of questions, it is very easy. 
All you have to do is change 'your' to 'my', repeat the last portion of the question and add your answer. 
We'll practice a couple of times.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S1.mp3">What is your favorite show?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S12.mp3">My favorite elementary teacher was Mrs. 
Smouse.</a>"

Different ways to ask about favorite things

You don't necessarily have to use the word favorite. 
Favorite basically means what you like the most. 
So, you can ask favorite questions without the word favorite.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S13.mp3">What do you like to eat the most?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S14.mp3">My favorite food is ice cream.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S15.mp3">What is a childhood memory that stands out?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S16.mp3">My favorite childhood memory is a time I went fishing with my dad.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S17.mp3">Which professor do you like the most?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S18.mp3">My favorite professor is Professor Kim.</a>"

Likewise, you can answer questions without using the word favorite.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S19.mp3">What is your favorite baseball team?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L31/sentence/L31S20.mp3">I like Seattle Mariners the most.</a>"

Hobbies are a hot topic anytime. 
Similar to favorite things, hobbies are favorite things that you do. 
This is a small section so let's get started.

<b>Questions you can ask:</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L32/sentence/L32S1.mp3">What are your hobbies?</a>"

But if it's not for these purposes, then I guess it can be a hobby. 
That's just my opinion though.</a>"

<h2>Exercise - US Culture</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/575-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Having lived in the United States and Korea, I realized one big thing immediately.

In Korea, I have to do a lot of walking. 
When I went to school or to work, I had to leave my house, walk to the bus stop or the subway which takes about 10-15 minutes, get off at my destination, and walk the rest of the way, which is another 15 minutes. 
Total time walking is about 25 minutes. 
This translates to 50 minutes a day round trip, and about 3-4 kilometers everyday. 
I didn't even know it, but I was exercising.

In America, everyone has a car. 
While going to work here, I literally walk about 7 minutes a day. 
That's a total distance of 300 meters. 
The reason is because I only have to walk to my car. 
I drive to work, and then I walk from the parking lot to my office. 
So, I realized I was gaining weight without having changed anything except the walking I wasn't doing.

I suppose that is why in America there is a big hype about exercising and losing weight. 
If you don't want to, you don't have to walk anywhere or exercise at all. 
In Korea, walking is part of the daily routine. 
So although you don't need to know this lesson as much as other lessons, it will still help when talking to foreigners about this subject. 
Let's continue with the lesson by doing the practice.

In the next exercise lesson, we will learn about speaking English in relation to working out in the gym

<h2>Exercise Gym - Lifting Weights</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/577-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Popular types of exercising are conducted in the gym or health club. 
When I refer to a gym, I am implying a health club. 
Two common types of exercising in the gym are working out / lifting weights, or using machines such as treadmills, bicycle machines, step machines, etc. 
It's common for guys to get together and talk about lifting weights. 
Likewise, girls get together and discuss the best methods to lose weight. 
In this lesson, we are going to lay the ground work on talking about exercising in the gym.

<b>Lifting weights</b>

Professional weight lifters are called body builders. 
But since the number of body builders are not significant, we are going to concentrate more on regular weight lifting.

I don't lift weights, but when I see a friend who is noticeably bigger due to lifting weights, these are the types of things I say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L37/sentence/L37S1.mp3">Have you been lifting?</a>"

You do not need to say lifting weights. 
When you say lifting, it's understood that you are talking about weights.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L37/sentence/L37S2.mp3">You got big man.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L37/sentence/L37S3.mp3">How long have you been lifting?</a>"

Other terminologies for lifting weights are:

Pumping Iron
Pressing Iron
Pressing Weights
Working Out
Weight Training
Hitting the Gym

<h2>Exercise Gym - Questions and Answers</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/578-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Here are some questions you can ask.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S1.mp3">Where do you work out?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S2.mp3">What club do you work out at?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S3.mp3">When do you usually work out?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S4.mp3">How often do you work out?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S5.mp3">How many hours do you work out in a day?</a>"

To ask how they work out or what their routine is, you can ask:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S6.mp3">When you bench, how many reps and sets do you do?</a>"

Reps are repetition. 
In weight lifting terminology, this means how many times they lift in one set.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S7.mp3">Do you do low reps with heavy weights, or many reps with light weight.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S8.mp3">How many sets do you do when you work out your arms?</a>"

If you are the person being asked these questions, here are ways you can answer:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S9.mp3">I work out at 24 Hour Fitness.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S10.mp3">I work out at Bally's.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S11.mp3">I work out at Samsung Health Club.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S12.mp3">I started lifting weights about 2 years ago.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S13.mp3">I have been lifting weights for about 2 years now.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S14.mp3">I just started 9 months ago.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S15.mp3">I usually work out 2 hours a day 4 times a week.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S16.mp3">I work out everyday for an hour.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S17.mp3">I go to the gym 3 times a week.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S18.mp3">I go in every other day.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S19.mp3">I can bench press 220 pounds.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S20.mp3">I squat 400 pounds.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S21.mp3">I curl 90 pounds.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S22.mp3">I'm trying to gain bulk so I'm doing low reps with heavy weights.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L38/sentence/L38S23.mp3">I'm trying to get ripped, so I'm doing a lot of repetitions.</a>"

Ripped means to get lines to show up in the muscles. 
It's called ripped because when you rip a piece of paper, you see a line in the paper where the tear is. 
So a person is ripped when you can see lines on his body due to muscles.

<h2>Exercise Gym - Other Methods</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/579-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Other ways to work out in a health club</b>

Many people lift weights in the health club, but many people also go to lose weight using machines such as the treadmill and bicycle machines.

Here are some things you can say in a conversation if you fall into this category.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L39/sentence/L39S1.mp3">When I go to the health club, I usually spend 30 minutes on the treadmill, 20 minutes on the bicycle, and finally 10 minutes on the step master.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L39/sentence/L39S2.mp3">There is no place to run in the city, so I have to do my running on the treadmill.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L39/sentence/L39S3.mp3">It always rains around here so I like to exercise in the gym.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L39/sentence/L39S4.mp3">I usually use the treadmill, but I try to work on the nautilus machines at least twice a week.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L39/sentence/L39S5.mp3">My wife exercises four times a week.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L39/sentence/L39S6.mp3">My husband can't last 10 minutes on the step machine.</a>"

<h2>Intro and General Things Review</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/581-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

This review section is going to incorporate every lesson we had so far.

We are not learning anything new here, but the sentences and topics will be selected randomly from previous lessons. 
If you feel you have done poorly after the first grouping of questions, please stop and go through the lessons you failed to answer. 
The only way you will completely master English is through persistence, hard work, and repetition. 
You are judging yourself, so be honest. 
The rule of thumb is that if you cannot answer a question relatively quickly, you need more practice.

<h2>University Life - Meeting New Students</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/584-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

As you can see, these portions of our lessons are dedicated to school. 
There are many things to learn here, so we are going to spend numerous lessons on school. 
But don't worry; only a couple will be geared towards classes. 
The rest will be about night life, partying, and having a good time. 
Before we start learning about topics such as classes and examinations, let's learn some general university phrases.

The first type of speaking you will have to do is when you meet new people. 
During this time, you can engage in idle small talk. 
Since you have learned small talk, feel free to use your new skills. 
On top of that, let's learn some new phrases that will help you.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S1.mp3">Where are you from?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S2.mp3">What high school did you attend?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S3.mp3">What are you going to major in?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S4.mp3">What are you majoring in?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S8.mp3">What is an easy class to take?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S9.mp3">Where is the best place to hang out?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S10.mp3">Are you in the dormitory?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S11.mp3">Where do you live?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S12.mp3">Why did you decide to come to this school?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S13.mp3">What made you choose Berkeley?</a>"

Many of the answer to these questions are general things you should already know. 
But it never hurts to review again, so let's go over how we can answer some of these questions.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S14.mp3">Where are you from?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S15.mp3">I'm from Seattle, Washington.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L41/sentence/L41S16.mp3">I'm an exchange student from Seoul, Korea.</a>"

<h2>University Life - Questions and Answers</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/585-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S1.mp3">What high school did you attend?</a>"
Before we answer this question, keep in mind that a foreigner will not be asked this question. 
Usually they will not ask a foreigner because they think that they will not know the high school you mention. 
But it is still good to know how to say such things.
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S2.mp3">I went to Lynnwood High.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S3.mp3">Lynnwood High.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S4.mp3">I went to a high school in San Francisco.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S5.mp3">A high school in Olympia.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S6.mp3">What are you going to major in?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S7.mp3">I haven't decided, but I'm leaning towards biology.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S8.mp3">I'm thinking about majoring in psychology.</a>"

Universities in the States are a little different than others. 
You don't choose your major until you are in your 3rd year. 
Basically, you apply to get into a major your junior year and if accepted, you have a major. 
If you get turned down, you have to find a different major, or spend another semester or year trying to get in. 
That's why you see so many people not graduate after 4 years. 
The problem is that they do not know what to major in.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S9.mp3">How many credits are you taking?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S10.mp3">I'm taking eighteen credits this quarter.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S11.mp3">I'm only taking 10 credits this semester.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S12.mp3">I'm taking 20 credits this semester.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S13.mp3">What classes are you taking?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S14.mp3">I'm taking chemistry 135, math 231, and English 101.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S15.mp3">This quarter I'm taking Intro to Sociology, Basics of Music Composition, and Spanish 101.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S16.mp3">What year are you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S17.mp3">I'm a junior.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S18.mp3">I'm a freshman.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S19.mp3">I'm a fourth year junior.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L42/sentence/L42S20.mp3">I'm a fifth year senior.</a>"

If you wonder how you can be a fourth year junior or a fifth year senior, you must understand that the number of credits you have completed represents what level you are. 
So a fourth year junior is someone who has been in school for four years, but has the same credits as a junior.

Remember that when you are talking to somebody, an answer to a question is another potential topic to talk about. 
I'll show you an example of a conversation. 
Please take note that I ask questions about the answer. 
Look for it in the practice session.

<h2>University Classes</h2>

In this lesson, we are going to learn about the terminologies you need to know when you talk about classes with your peers.

There are several sections I will break this up into:
Registering for classes
Grades in class
Professors and different curriculum 
Dropping out/Withdrawal

First, let's talk about registering for classes.

<h2>University Classes - Grades</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/589-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Grades in Classes</b>

Talking about grades is all dependent on if you open up about these things or not. 
I know some people are very secretive about their grades, and others like me freely talk about grades. 
So make sure you are close friends with the person you are talking to about grades.

Grades are different depending on school. 
Some schools give letter grades that translates into number grade. 
Other schools strictly give number grades only. 
The difference is in letter grades, you cannot get a 3.5. You either get a B+, which is a 3.3, or an A- which is a 3.7. However, in number grades, the instructor can give a 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S1.mp3">What did you get in English?</a>" If you are talking about the subject, you do not need to say grade. 
But if not, you can ask, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S2.mp3">What grade did you get in English?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S3.mp3">I can't believe I got a 3.1 in biology. 
What did you get?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S4.mp3">How was your GPA this semester?</a>" GPA stands for Grade Point Average.
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S5.mp3">How were your grades this quarter?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S6.mp3">Did you do well this semester?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S7.mp3">Did you screw up your grades this semester?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S10.mp3">How are your grades?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S11.mp3">What's your accum?</a>" This is short for accumulated. 
This is asking what your overall GPA is.

I'll give examples for both specific and general answers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S12.mp3">In English, I got a B+.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S13.mp3">I got a 2.9 in English.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S14.mp3">I did similar to you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S15.mp3">I got a 3.4 this semester.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S16.mp3">If I didn't get the C+ in Biology, my GPA would have been awesome this semester.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S17.mp3">My grades were ok.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S18.mp3">I did average this quarter.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S19.mp3">My accum is 3.6 right now. 
I really want to get over 3.75.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S20.mp3">My overall GPA is 2.94. I need to get a 3.4 next semester to bring my GPA above 3.0.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S21.mp3">My GPA sucks.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S22.mp3">I did pretty good this semester.</a>" Although grammatically this is incorrect, spoken English allows such errors. 
If you want to be grammatically perfect, you will need to say, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L45/sentence/L45S23.mp3">I did pretty well this semester.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S9.mp3">Professor Johnson is so uptight. 
He's always lecturing and never allows students to ask any questions.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S10.mp3">Professor Johnson is a brilliant professor. 
I learned so much from him.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S11.mp3">No way. 
He is such a hard grader. 
I was expecting a 3.7, but it turns out that I got a 3.1. Can you believe that?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S12.mp3">His grading system is messed up.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S14.mp3">He's an easy grader.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S15.mp3">So far, I have taken 2 classes from Professor Jackson.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L46/sentence/L46S22.mp3">We had two presentations, but they were pretty easy.

<h2>University Classes - Dropping Out / Withdrawal</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/591-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are two ways to leave a class. 
You either drop out, or you withdrawal. 
Dropping out usually means you are going to get a failing grade and you don't care about it. 
But primarily, dropping out refers to leaving college life altogether. 
So if you intend to say that you dropped out of a class, you should use withdrawal. 
There are several time periods for withdrawal. 
The first week, there is no penalty. 
The second week up to the first month, a W will show up on your transcript. 
And finally, withdrawal after the half way point will give you a failing grade. 
But this is dependent on each school policy. 
So learn the withdrawal format of your school. 
I was using the dates mentioned above only as an example. 
Let's learn some sentences to say these kinds of things.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S1.mp3">I dropped out of my chemistry class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S2.mp3">I withdrew from my biology class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S3.mp3">I had too many classes as it is, so I dropped out of my statistics class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S4.mp3">I couldn't keep up with the schedule, so I dropped out of that class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S5.mp3">I couldn't understand the material, so I withdrew.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S6.mp3">I hated the professor, so I just withdrew.</a>"

If you need to ask questions about withdrawal, these may help:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S7.mp3">When is the last day to withdrawal?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S8.mp3">If I withdrawal now, will it show up on my transcript?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S9.mp3">Does a withdrawal look bad on the transcript?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S10.mp3">How do I drop out of a class that I don't want to take anymore?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S11.mp3">What is the procedure to withdrawal from class?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S12.mp3">How do I withdrawal from a certain class?</a>"

Other things you might want to say when discussing this topic...

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S13.mp3">Are you sure you want to drop out of that class. 
You only have 4 more weeks. 
At least you can get the credit.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S14.mp3">If I stay in that class, I'm going to screw up my GPA.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S15.mp3">The best I can do is a C in this class. 
I don't want a C on my transcript. 
I'm going to withdrawal from the class.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S16.mp3">If you get a bad grade, can't you just re-take the course?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S17.mp3">Even if I retake the course, both grades are used. 
This school has a different system where re-taking the course doesn't really help.</a>"

<h2>Examinations</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/593-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

What is a school without examinations? They all have it. 
So, we will have to spend a session talking about exams.

There are many types of tests and different terminologies. 
You can be taking an in-class test, or it could be a take-home final. 
It could be a multiple choice exam or an essay type format. 
In either case, we will cover it here. 
First, let's learn the different terminologies associated with testing.

Examination
Mid-term
Finals
Test
Quiz
Pop-quiz
Exam
Take-home final
Research paper
Final paper
Report
Essay
Presentation

<h2>Examinations - Finding Information</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/594-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Having a lot of information about tests can help prepare for exams. 
The next several questions are geared towards finding specific information.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S1.mp3">Does Professor Giles use old exam questions for his tests?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S2.mp3">Can I borrow your old exams for Intermediate Accounting? I want to use the questions to test myself before the real exam.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S3.mp3">Do you know anybody who took Physics 340? I want to know the types of questions that were asked on the final.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S4.mp3">Do you think I need to study chapter 6 for the mid-term? It's so boring, and I can't seem to apply it anywhere.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S5.mp3">What topics did the professor cover the most in the final exam?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S6.mp3">What were the long essay questions on?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S7.mp3">Do you remember the long essay questions you had on the final?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S8.mp3">I was thinking about buying the study supplement for the engineering class. 
Do you think it will help?</a>"

And of course, you may be required to answer these types of questions, so let's get into answering:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S9.mp3">How many tests did you have to take in your Math class?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S10.mp3">We had a total of 4 tests in that math class.</a>" Or more simply, '4 tests.'

Answering can be real easy. 
The reason I put full sentences is for your practice. 
But remember when you really answer, you are not required to put them in full sentences. 
I'll try to mix it up so you get a familiar feel answering both long and short ways.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S11.mp3">What was the mid-term like?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S12.mp3">The mid-term was hard. 
If you read all the material, you will still have a hard time because the professor wrote up all the questions in a difficult way.</a>"

<h2>Examinations - General Information</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/595-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The hardest types of questions to answer are the, 'What was it like' types, and the 'how was' types. 
The reason it is hard is because you have to explain in your own words the answer. 
It's not as simple as a number or a 'yes' or 'no.'

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S1.mp3">How much percentage is the mid-term towards the final grade?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S2.mp3">The instructor said it was twenty percent of our final grade.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S3.mp3">Do you have to write any papers in that class?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S4.mp3">No. 
We only had one mid-term and one final.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S5.mp3">Yes. 
We had to write 2 essays for that class.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S6.mp3">How many pages did you have to write for your essays?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S7.mp3">We had to write 5 pages for both essays.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S8.mp3">Was the open-book exam hard?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S9.mp3">Most of the time, open-book exams are harder, but this one was really easy. 
All the questions were in the glossary so I found the answers quickly.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S10.mp3">How difficult was the take-home final?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S11.mp3">It is easy that we have the material to look through, but it is very time consuming. 
I had to do an all-nighter just to finish.</a>"

All-nighter means to stay up all night.

<h2>Roommate - Dormitory</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/598-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

While in school it is common to have a roommate when you are in the dormitory. 
In the States, it's also common to share an apartment with a roommate. 
This lesson will cover the English you will need to talk to your roommate. 
Of course you can talk about many things, but I will specifically target this lesson towards roommate stuff.

<b>Dormitory Roommate</b>

When you first go into a dormitory, you will either be greeted by the person already there, or you will have to greet someone that is coming later than you. 
Most dormitories have one room for two people. 
After the dormitory section, I will cover living in an apartment with a roommate.

When you arrive to the dormitory, you can usually engage in small talk first. 
Most of the time, you have to get to know one another. 
Talk is initiated by both parties simultaneously. 
You can ask questions like where they came from, what year they are in, or what they like to do. 
But besides that, you have to find out the living habits of each other. 
After you engage in small talk, you can ask these questions:

It's important to know the sleeping habits of your roommate, so ask if they are a night person or a morning person.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S1.mp3">So, are you a night owl or a morning bird?</a>"

A night person is referred to as an owl. 
That is because owls are more active at night. 
Birds on the other hand wake up early. 
So they associate morning people to birds.

If you don't want to use this expression, you can ask,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S2.mp3">Are you a night person or a morning person?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S3.mp3">What time do you usually go to sleep?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S4.mp3">What time do you usually wake up?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S5.mp3">If you didn't have anything to do the next day, what time would you sleep till?</a>"

It's common courtesy to respect each other. 
If you are asleep, the roommate should be quiet. 
This goes for you too.

When you get sleepy, you can either go to sleep, or tell your roommate that you are going to sleep.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S6.mp3">I'm a little tired. 
I'm going to sleep now. 
Have a good night.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S7.mp3">I'm sleepy. 
Time to go to bed. 
See you in the morning.</a>"

If you like listening to music, you can ask your roommate,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S8.mp3">Does the music bother you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S9.mp3">Let me know if you want me to turn the music off.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L52/sentence/L52S10.mp3">Do you mind if I turn the stereo on?</a>"

But when you ask questions about music or TV, you should make sure that person is not studying. 
If they are, then it's pointless to ask because it should be quiet. 
This is only good for times when you are both doing nothing.

<h2>Roommate - Sharing things and Questions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/599-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Sometimes a roommate will bring a mini refrigerator, or it might turn out that you will. 
It's polite to let your roommate use the refrigerator too.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S1.mp3">Feel free to use the refrigerator.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S2.mp3">Can I put my drinks in your fridge?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S3.mp3">Do you mind if I use your refrigerator?</a>"

If you connect with the person and you become friends, then you will not even need to ask. 
For example, after you get to know the person your comments will be different. 
Say I become a friend of my roommate. 
And then after a month or so, he brings a refrigerator. 
I wouldn't ask to use it, I would rather comment on how useful it will be. 
It's assumed that a friend can use the refrigerator, so no need to sound weird by asking politely. 
Instead you can say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S4.mp3">Cool, you brought a fridge. 
I can go buy milk now.</a>"

This comment is saying that you appreciate the refrigerator by saying, 'cool', then you indicate that you are going to use it by saying you will buy milk. 
If your friend doesn't object to your comment, then it is the same thing as getting permission to use the refrigerator.

<b>Responding to questions</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S5.mp3">Are you a night person or a morning person?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S14.mp3">Do you mind if I turn the stereo on?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S15.mp3">Oh, feel free.</a>"

Don't worry about it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S18.mp3">Do you mind if I use your refrigerator?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S19.mp3">No problem at all.</a>"

<h2>Roommate - Apartment</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/600-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When people live in an apartment, it is usually among friends. 
So there's no need to worry about being too polite. 
As long as you have common courtesy, you will have no problem. 
On the other hand, if you are looking for a roommate, then there are some things you should learn how to say. 
The list of questions below are examples of questions you should ask when looking to join existing people in an apartment.

<h2>Fraternity and Sorority - Explanation</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/602-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

A big part of university life in America is the fraternity and sorority. 
Since many people do not know what they are, let me explain a little so you understand what I'm talking about in this session.

Fraternity and sorority is a group of people that get together and live in a big building. 
They are in a special group that is defined by their own rules. 
Most of the students live in either apartments or dormitories, but an alternative is to live in a fraternity or a sorority. 
I don't know the short name for sorority, but the short name for a fraternity is a frat. 
It all depends on the sentence whether you should call it a fraternity or a frat. 
Also, fraternity and sorority have names and they are already established. 
The names are always Greek and so they named the area where these buildings are located, Greek Row.

Fraternity is the terminology used for guys, and sorority is what they use for the ladies. 
So if you are a guy, you will be looking at fraternities, and if you are a lady, you will be joining a sorority.

The price to live in a fraternity or a sorority is similar to the price of dormitories. 
There are many sizes, but as an example, a fraternity house might have 50 rooms. 
All rooms either hold 2 or sometimes 3 people. 
There is a kitchen and food is served at specific times.

If you want to get into a fraternity or sorority, you usually have to apply and interview with existing members. 
Popular ones are very picky and will not let some types of people in. 
Others are desperate to fill their rooms so they will accept anyone.

Almost everyone who has been in a fraternity or a sorority never regrets it. 
There are more people who regret not having lived in a fraternity than having lived in one. 
So if you plan on attending a university in the states and will be there for more than 2 years, you should definitely consider the frat or sorority life.

Here are some examples of fraternity and sorority names. 
I do not know these fraternities or sororities. 
I am using this as an example so you understand the naming scheme.

Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity
Kappa Sigma Fraternity
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity

Zeta Phi Beta Sorority
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority
Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority

<h2>Fraternity and Sorority - General</h2>

In this session, we will cover some of the things you need to know how to say if you decide to join a fraternity or a sorority, or if you are just talking with a member.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S1.mp3">How do you like being in a fraternity?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S2.mp3">What is it like living in a sorority?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S3.mp3">How often do you hold parties in your frat house?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S4.mp3">Is it hard to get into a fraternity?</a>"

Other comments you might hear will be...

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S7.mp3">Those sorority chicks really know how to party.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S8.mp3">All the frat boys want to do is get you into bed.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S9.mp3">Some fraternities are very studious.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S10.mp3">He's a good friend from my fraternity.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S11.mp3">The Delta house is having a party this Friday. 
You wanna come?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L56/sentence/L56S12.mp3">We're going to crash the Sorority party this weekend.</a>"

Crash in this sentence means to go uninvited.

<h2>Fraternity and Sorority - Joining</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/604-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are trying to find a fraternity or a sorority to join, you would either need to know someone in that group already, or find an advertisement in the local school paper, or go to the fraternity or sorority house and ask how to become a member.

Here are some things you can say initially:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S1.mp3">Hi, I was interested in joining a fraternity. 
What is the process to get in?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S2.mp3">Hi. 
I was wondering what I needed to do to get into this sorority.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S3.mp3">Are you taking in members now?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S4.mp3">Where can I find information on joining this sorority?</a>"

After the initial sentence, they should respond with more information. 
Here is an example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S5.mp3">We take new members every semester. 
All you need to do is fill out this application, and then we will contact you for an interview.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S6.mp3">Every Monday at 10 am, we have an informational session about our sorority. 
I highly recommend you attend if you are interested.</a>"

If you ask a question about information, they might respond with a question such as,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S7.mp3">What would you like to know?</a>"

You can ask the following questions if you have this opportunity.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S8.mp3">How much does it cost each month?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S9.mp3">What meals are included with the monthly rent?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S10.mp3">How many people are in this sorority?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S11.mp3">What activities do you have in this fraternity?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S12.mp3">Do you have tours of the building?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S13.mp3">What is the policy during summer break? Can we stay in the frat house during the summer months?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L57/sentence/L57S14.mp3">How long has this fraternity been around?</a>"

<h2>Fraternity and Sorority - Interview Questions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/605-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you are trying to get into a fraternity or a sorority, you might have to interview. 
Lot of the interview questions are geared towards who you are. 
They are trying to determine if your personality matches what the group represents.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S1.mp3">Why should we let you in this fraternity?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S2.mp3">What do you want to gain from your experience in a fraternity?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S3.mp3">What can you bring into this sorority?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S4.mp3">What are your hobbies?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S5.mp3">What do you usually do on a weekend?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S9.mp3">Do you play any sports?</a>"

Before answering these questions, it is important to find out what type of fraternity or sorority you are applying for. 
Sometimes a good answer for one group will be a terrible answer to another. 
Most of the time, fraternities are about having a good time with friends.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L58/sentence/L58S10.mp3">Why should we let you in this fraternity?</a>"

Finally, if you decide to join a fraternity or a sorority and you pass the interview, you will have to go through initiation. 
Some places are real easy, but some places can be a little weird. 
For example, you might have to run down the street in your underwear, or you might have to kiss 10 different people, or you might have to drink a lot. 
What ever it is, it's usually a surprise. 
Try to get as much information as you can before you join the group.

<h2>College Partying</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/607-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

One of the great things about college is the parties. 
However, it could be boring and dull for others. 
I'm not saying it's fun for everyone. 
But if you like to drink, have fun with a lot of different people, it might just be your thing.

First, I'll explain the various parties you can attend. 
There are fraternity and sorority parties, parties at a friend's house, parties at clubs or bars, night clubs, and so on. 
That is what we will discuss here. 
We will have other sessions on different types of parties, but since we are on the college track right now, I will dedicate this session to partying while in school.

Usually, fraternity or a sorority party has a lot of drinking, a lot of people, and a lot of music. 
At the party, you usually mingle and meet a lot of people. 
Some people go to the parties to have sex. 
These can occur at many parties because there are a lot of rooms in the fraternity and sorority houses. 
But don't think this is all fun and games. 
There are some people who thinks these types of parties are boring. 
For the people who do not like to talk to strangers, it can really be boring. 
They will end up in a corner by themselves and have a beer or two and then go home. 
It basically depends on what type of atmosphere you like.

If you like this type of partying, the first thing you need to do is find the party.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S1.mp3">Where is everyone hanging out this weekend?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S2.mp3">Are there any good fraternity parties this weekend?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S3.mp3">Where does everyone go to party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S4.mp3">Are there any parties to crash this weekend?</a>"

An easier way to find a party is to have a friend who is in the loop.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S5.mp3">There's a party this weekend at the Kappa Sorority house. 
I think we can sneak in. 
Wanna go?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S6.mp3">There's a bunch of us going to the Last Supper Club in downtown. 
If you're not doing anything, you should join us.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S7.mp3">A friend of mine is having a party at a huge house. 
It's going to be a blast. 
Let's go man.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L59/sentence/L59S8.mp3">There's going to be a kegger at my fraternity. 
You're welcome to come.</a>"

<h2>College Partying - Questions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/608-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are new to these types of partying, you can ask questions about what takes place at these parties.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S1.mp3">What do you usually do at the party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S2.mp3">What goes on at the party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S3.mp3">Are there a lot of girls?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S4.mp3">Are there a lot of cute guys?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S5.mp3">What types of drinks do they have at the party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S6.mp3">Do I need to bring anything to the party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L60/sentence/L60S7.mp3">How many people usually come to the party?</a>"

The most important thing you will need to learn is what to say when you are at the party.

In order to be liked, it doesn't matter what you look like, or how much money you have. 
Although both of these help, the most important thing is if you are a fun person. 
Usually, fun people have good things to say and keeps the conversation going. 
You can engage in small talk, but it also doesn't matter what you say, it matters how you say it.

The most important thing to do is to do a lot of laughing. 
It really doesn't matter what you say, so no use learning new sentences. 
I will have several practice sessions so you can hear what the conversation should sound like.

<h2>Smoking</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/610-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are several facts to smoking. 
First, smoking is bad for you. 
Second, everyone knows it's bad for you, but many people still smoke. 
I will cover two aspects of smoking. 
First, we will learn about asking for a cigarette. 
And second, we will learn about what people say about smokers and the conversations that take place between non-smokers and smokers.

First, let's talk about smokers.

There is not much you need to know except how to ask for a cigarette. 
What else are you going to say?

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S1.mp3">Do you have an extra cigarette?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S2.mp3">May I have a cigarette?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S3.mp3">Can I have a cigarette?</a>"

Sometimes, you can ask while giving a reason.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S4.mp3">Can I get a cigarette from you? I just ran out.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S5.mp3">I forgot my smokes at my house. 
Do you have an extra one?</a>"

There are other terminologies you can use.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S6.mp3">Can I bum a cigarette from you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S7.mp3">Can I bum one of those?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S8.mp3">Do you have an extra cigarette I can bum?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S9.mp3">I need a cigarette. 
Can you help me out?</a>"

Bum is another way of saying beggar. 
In essence, you are admitting that you are a bum for asking. 
Although the meaning can sound pretty serious, many people use this term to be polite.

Answering these questions is pretty simple.

Nobody ever says, 'No.' That's just too rude. 
If it's a friend, then you don't even need to say anything. 
Just pull out the pack of cigarettes and hand your friend a cigarette. 
But here are some other things you can say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S10.mp3">Sure.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S11.mp3">I think I have a spare.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S12.mp3">Here you go.</a>"

If you are sitting at a coffee shop, you can put it on the counter and say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S13.mp3">No need to ask, just help yourself.</a>"

If you don't have anymore then you can say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S14.mp3">Sorry. 
I just ran out.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S15.mp3">This was my last one.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L61/sentence/L61S16.mp3">I bummed this one off another person.</a>"

Or if it's a stranger walking by, you can ignore them and keep walking without saying anything, although this could be rude.

<h2>Smoking - Non Smoking Areas</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/611-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Smoking and non-smoking areas

Currently in America, many states are banning indoor public smoking. 
That means no smoking in bars, restaurants, or any other place that is deemed public. 
California is an example of a state that implemented this rule. 
But there are still places where smoking is permitted.

Here are some questions you might find useful.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S1.mp3">Is this a non-smoking establishment?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S2.mp3">Do you have a smoking section here?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S3.mp3">Is smoking allowed?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S4.mp3">Where is the smoking section?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S5.mp3">Is there a designated smoking area?</a>"

At a bar or a smoking place, if you need an ashtray, you can say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S6.mp3">Can I have an ashtray?</a>"
If you have one and you need another one, simply say, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S7.mp3">Can I have another ashtray?</a>"

If you are smoking in an area that is a non-smoking area, you might hear people say the following... if you are a non-smoker, then you can learn this to say to others that are smoking in a non-smoking area.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S8.mp3">This is a non-smoking area.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S9.mp3">There's no smoking in this area.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S10.mp3">This is a non smoking establishment.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S11.mp3">There's no smoking in the airport.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S12.mp3">Smoking is only allowed in the bar area.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S13.mp3">You cannot smoke here. 
Can you please go to the bar or outside to smoke?</a>"

Responding to these can be done with a simple, 
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S14.mp3">I'm terribly sorry. 
I'll take this to the smoking area.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L62/sentence/L62S15.mp3">Sorry. 
I didn't know I was in a no smoking area. 
I'll move right away.</a>"

The easiest way is just to apologize and leave immediately with a, 'sorry.'

<h2>Smoking - Quitting and General Statements</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/612-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are in a hotel getting a room, the clerk might ask you,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S1.mp3">Would you like a smoking room or a non-smoking room?</a>"

If you hate the smell of smoke and they do not ask, you can verify what type of room it is by asking,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S2.mp3">Can you make sure it's a non-smoking room?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S3.mp3">Is this going to be a non-smoking room?</a>"

While smoking, you will sometimes talk about smoking. 
If that's the case, you can ask these types of questions.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S4.mp3">How long have you been smoking?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S5.mp3">Have you been smoking long?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S6.mp3">Have you ever tried to quit smoking?</a>"

Comments you can say while smoking with someone

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S7.mp3">Smoking is so bad, but it feels so good.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S8.mp3">I've been smoking for 10 years.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S9.mp3">I tried to quit a couple of times. 
It's really hard.</a>"

I heard some comments from some people justifying cigarette smoking

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S10.mp3">There was a 90 year old man who smokes one pack a day and drinks one bottle of Soju a day and he is very healthy. 
He's been doing it for over 60 years.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S11.mp3">I only smoke when I'm with friends.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S12.mp3">I only smoke when I'm drinking.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S13.mp3">I can quit anytime I want. 
There is just no need to right now.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S14.mp3">The best way to quit is cold turkey.</a>" Cold turkey is a terminology used to completely stop without any help with things such as nicotine gum or nicotine patches.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S15.mp3">There are a lot of aids to help you stop smoking. 
I heard hypnosis is pretty good.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L63/sentence/L63S16.mp3">I quit for 3 months last year. 
I used the patch to help stop the cravings.</a>"

<h2>Smoking - Asking for Light and Hate Smoking</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/613-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you don't have a lighter or matches, do not ask for fire. 
That is a common mistake. 
Instead, ask for a light.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S1.mp3">Do you have a light?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S2.mp3">Can I borrow your lighter?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S3.mp3">Can I use your matches?</a>"

If you catch someone smoking, like your kid or your significant other, you can say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S4.mp3">Have you been smoking?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S5.mp3">Is that smoke I smell?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S6.mp3">Who taught you how to smoke?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S7.mp3">Where did you get those cigarettes?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S8.mp3">I saw you smoking yesterday.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S9.mp3">You smoke don't you?</a>"

Finally, for people who do not like smoking, here is a section on communicating your disgust with smoking.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S10.mp3">I hate smoking. 
It smells so bad and hurts my throat.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S11.mp3">I don't like that club because it smells like smoke in there.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S12.mp3">It is way too smoky in the bar.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S13.mp3">It's a little stuffy with smoke in here. 
I'm going outside to get some fresh air.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S14.mp3">Have you ever kissed a smoker? You can taste the smoke. 
It's disgusting.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S15.mp3">I get a headache when I'm around smoke.</a>"

Second hand smoke is a term used for non-smokers breathing the smoke from smokers. 
So if you are a non-smoker and you are in a bar, the air you are breathing is basically second hand smoke.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S16.mp3">I heard that second hand smoke is just as bad for you as smoking.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S17.mp3">Second hand smoke can give you health problems too.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S18.mp3">Children who grow up breathing second hand smoke have greater health risks growing up.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L64/sentence/L64S19.mp3">I don't mind second hand smoke. 
I got used to it over the years.</a>"

<h2>Drinking - Terminologies</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/615-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Many countries have drinking rules such as using two hands to receive drinks, never allowing your drinking friend to pour their own drinks, never leaving a glass empty too long, and so on. 
But in America, there isn't that many rules you need to know. 
I'll cover as much as I can and soon enough, you shouldn't have any problems talking while drinking in America. 
(I do not know the drinking etiquettes of other English speaking countries such as England, so learn about drinking rules before going there)

In a Bar
There are a few terminologies you have to learn. 


Tap - Beer in a glass that is from a large container
Well - Same as Tap. 
Different wording
Pint - This is 16 fluid ounces. 
This roughly translates to 500cc.
Bottles - Bottles of beer
Pitchers - Same as Tap, but put in a pitcher
Mixed Drinks - Special Drinks like a mixture of Vodka and Orange Juice. 
They have names for these such as Fuzzy Navel, Rum and Coke, Buttery Nipple, Gin and tonic, and so on.
Wine - Red or white. 
Bottle or glass
Shots - Hard alcohol in small shot glass 
On the Rocks - Hard alcohol in a bigger glass with ice
Straight Up - Used when ordering a hard alcohol. 
Specifying that you do not want ice
Double - Two shots in a bigger glass
Round - Used in groups when ordering together.
Bottoms up - One shot. 
Drink everything in your glass
Cheers - Word used before hitting glasses together before drinking
Champagne - Carbonated wine used in special occasions such as weddings.

Usually with champagne

<h2>Drinking - Ordering Drinks</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/616-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

I'll cover ordering drinks in a restaurant in the 'Restaurant' section. 
For now, I'll limit this session to ordering drinks in a bar, and drinking with friends.

When you are in a bar, you can either go up to the counter or wait for a server to come by. 
If you go to the counter, you order what you want by saying the drink name and the quantity.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S1.mp3">I'll take 4 bottles of Corona.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S2.mp3">I'll take a pitcher of Red Hook.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S3.mp3">Give me 3 shots of Crowne.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S4.mp3">I'll have one Jack and Coke.</a>"

After you get the drink, the bartender will usually say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S5.mp3">That will be $12.50.</a>"

If you pay with cash, then you should receive change. 
Make sure to tip once in a while. 
However, if you pay with a card, they will usually ask if you want to leave it open. 
Leaving it open means to keep the credit card open so if you order more drinks, you will get one bill instead of having to use the credit card multiple times. 
You will hear something like this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S6.mp3">Do you want to keep it open?</a>"

If you want to keep the credit card open before they ask you, you can say this.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S7.mp3">Can you keep it open?</a>"

If you have a credit card open, then any more drinks you order will go on your credit card. 
When you are done for the night, you can simply tell them that you are ready for your bill.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S8.mp3">Can I get my bill?</a>"

If the bartender has your credit card, then you can go up to the counter and say the same thing, or say, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L66/sentence/L66S9.mp3">I would like to close my tab.</a>"

<h2>Drinking - Ordering at a Table</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/617-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are sitting at a table in a bar, a server will come up and ask you what you want. 
They can ask in multiple ways, but the most common are the following.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S1.mp3">What can I get you guys?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S2.mp3">What can I get you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S3.mp3">What would you like today?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S4.mp3">What will it be?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S5.mp3">What do you guys want today?</a>"

Other things you can ask is if there are any specials.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S6.mp3">Are there any specials today?</a>"

If they do, they will probably tell you the drink and the price that is on special. 
Here is an example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S7.mp3">All our margaritas are $2.50, and well drinks are $2.00.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S8.mp3">Every Monday we have pitchers for $5.00.</a>"

If you are having pints or shots or some other drink, and you want to get one more for everyone, you can say to the server that you want one more round.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S9.mp3">Can we get one more round?</a>"

They will respond by saying, 'Same thing?' or 'Four Coronas again?'

When you are sitting with your friends to drink, mostly you just talk and drink. 
But if somebody is getting low on a drink, you can offer to buy another one. 
Another situation is if someone buys you a drink, you want to say that you will buy the next round. 
Here are some examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S10.mp3">I'm going to get another drink. 
Do you want one?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S11.mp3">Let me buy you a drink.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L67/sentence/L67S12.mp3">Thanks. 
I'll get the next round.</a>"

<h2>Drinking - General Things</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/618-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you are all standing in front of the bar to buy a beer, sometimes one person will pay. 
Usually everyone reaches for their money, but one person who wants to pay says, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S1.mp3">It's alright, I got this one.</a>"

Another popular saying is when you meet a good friend and you want to buy them a drink.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S2.mp3">Hey, let me buy you a drink. 
What do you want?</a>"

When you do cheers, you can either say cheers, or dedicate the next gulp to something.

You first lift up your glass and say, 
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S3.mp3">This is to good times. 
Cheers.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S4.mp3">For the end of our junior year.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S5.mp3">To success.</a>"

Basically anything you want to drink for.

Among friends, you can recommend shots. 
At a bar, mostly people drink beer and mixed drinks. 
However, between drinks someone can recommend having a shot altogether.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S6.mp3">Hey, let's all do a shot.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S7.mp3">Shot time.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S8.mp3">Let's get 4 shots of Jack.</a>"

Asking questions about how well someone drinks

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S9.mp3">How much can you drink?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S10.mp3">How many beers does it take to get you buzzed?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S11.mp3">Depending on the day, but mostly it will take 4 beers before I start to get buzzed.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S12.mp3">I usually have about 6 drinks when I go out.</a>"

Also, when someone can't drink that much, people usually use the term light weight.

You should also know how to ask if a person is ok to drive. 
If they look drunk, then you should take away their keys. 
However, if they are ok, you can usually ask them if they are capable of driving.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S13.mp3">Are you ok to drive?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S14.mp3">Are you going to be able to drive?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S15.mp3">You sure you can drive?</a>"

Before moving on to the Interactive Practice section for drinking, listen to a conversation with a couple of friends in a bar.

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L68/sentence/L68S34.mp3"><b><i>Listen to the Conversation</i></b></a>

<h2>Health - Family</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/624-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you are young and pretty healthy, then you do not need to say many different things. 
What we have covered so far is a good starting point in health discussions. 
For the next section, I am going to go into good and bad health of older people such as parents or grandparents.

If a person is very old and does not have any sickness, then the usual comment is to mention how healthy that person is.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S1.mp3">My grandfather can't move that much because of leg pains. 
But besides that, he is very healthy.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S2.mp3">She's quite healthy for her age.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S3.mp3">My mother always complains about some pain, but the doctor can never find any wrong with her.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S4.mp3">My grandmother is in a nursing home. 
She's pretty healthy but can't walk that well.</a>"

Often times we ask about the health of a new born baby. 
Here are some sentences you can say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S5.mp3">I just had my baby.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S6.mp3">Oh really? Is the baby healthy?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S7.mp3">He's a healthy little boy.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S8.mp3">I'm so blessed with healthy children.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S9.mp3">I'm so happy that my children are all healthy.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S10.mp3">I wish I was rich, but I can't complain. 
I have a job, my children are healthy, and most of all, we are all happy.</a>"

Although it is fortunate to have healthy relatives, we are sometimes in a situation where health is a problem in the family.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S11.mp3">My uncle died from stomach cancer. 
The doctors say it is mostly hereditary but I think it was due to all the spicy food he ate.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S12.mp3">My father is very unhealthy. 
He says it is because he didn't take care of his body when he was young.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S13.mp3">My sister is always sick. 
I'm really concerned about her health.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L71/sentence/L71S14.mp3">My brother is tired all the time. 
I think he is unhealthy.</a>"

<h2>Body Parts</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/626-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

I'm not going to talk about every body part in this lesson. 
For information concerning detailed body parts, I would suggest a book that is solely covering body parts. 
Instead, we are going to cover various types of conversations and sentences most commonly used in standard English communication.

Let's first list the different body parts I will cover in this lesson:

Arm, Forearm, Elbow, Wrist, Hand, Finger, Knuckles

Leg, Calf, Thigh, Knee, Ankle, Toes

Head, Ear, Mouth, Nose, Eyes

Neck, Chest, Stomach, Back, Groin, Butt, Shoulder

<b>The arm area</b>

Here is a list of sentences most commonly used

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S1.mp3">My arm hurts.</a>"

Remember you can change the word of arm to any of the other body parts.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S2.mp3">My wrist is sore.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S3.mp3">I sprained my wrist while I was playing tennis.</a>"

Sprain is to hurt the ligaments of a joint. 
It is different than breaking a bone. 
Breaking a bone is hurting the bone itself, and sprain is hurting the tissue that connects the bone.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S4.mp3">I can't bend my elbow that well.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S5.mp3">Your fingers are so long.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S6.mp3">My fingers are short and stubby.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S7.mp3">I like to crack my knuckles.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S8.mp3">My grandmother has arthritis so she can't move her hands well.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S9.mp3">I got a flu shot on my arm yesterday.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S10.mp3">I hate people who don't wash their hands after going to the bathroom.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L72/sentence/L72S11.mp3">I broke my finger when I fell down the stairs.</a>"

<h2>Body Parts - Leg and Head Area</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/627-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>The leg area</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S1.mp3">I went jogging yesterday so my legs are all sore.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S2.mp3">Your legs will be very sore after you go skiing.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S3.mp3">I hate it when I get cramps.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S4.mp3">I usually get cramps on my calf.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S5.mp3">I banged my toe against the coffee table.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S7.mp3">I got a bruise on my thigh after he gave me a charley horse.</a>"

Charley horse is most widely used to describe as stiffness or a muscle ache of the upper leg after being hit. 
So if I hit someone in the thigh, then that is called giving someone a Charley horse.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S8.mp3">I banged my knee against the door and it hurts.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S9.mp3">I got this scar on my knee when I was little.</a>"

<b>The head area</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S14.mp3">My ears are so cold.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S15.mp3">My nose turns red when I'm cold.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S16.mp3">I always get a runny nose during the winter time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L73/sentence/L73S24.mp3">I hit my head on the desk after picking up a pen.</a>"

<h2>Dieting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/631-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Everyone who wants to lose weight has to go on a diet. 
Since most of the people are somewhat overweight, this becomes a hot topic to talk about. 
Although both men and women go on diets, I will primarily focus this towards the women population as it is more of a discussion topic for them.

When you see someone and notice a weight change, you usually want to mention that they look better or that they lost weight.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S1.mp3">Have you lost weight?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S2.mp3">You look better, did you lose weight?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S3.mp3">Have you been dieting?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S4.mp3">Wow. 
You look so good.</a>"

Another time dieting discussion starts is during meals. 
When a person is trying to eat less, people question why and a conversation about dieting begins.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S5.mp3">Is that all you're going to eat?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S6.mp3">Why aren't you eating anything?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S7.mp3">Did you already eat?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S8.mp3">Are you on a diet or something?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S9.mp3">Are you not hungry?</a>"

And then the person will usually respond by saying:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S10.mp3">I'm trying to lose some weight.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S11.mp3">I started to diet so I am watching what I eat.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S12.mp3">I want to lose some weight before I take family pictures next month.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S13.mp3">I'm on a diet.</a>"

Some people look so skinny and they still say they are going to go on a diet. 
Here are some comments you can say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S14.mp3">You do not need to go on a diet.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S15.mp3">You look great now. 
Why do you want to go on a diet?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L75/sentence/L75S16.mp3">Yeah right. 
Like you have to lose weight.</a>"

Remember that it is ok to talk about dieting with friends, but if you are among people you do not know too well, make sure there isn't somebody who is overweight already. 
You don't want to talk about dieting in front of these people because they might be self conscious about their weight.

<h2>Dieting - Questions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/632-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Now that we have covered some basic sentences, let's work on sentences that will help in a discussion. 
First let's cover some questions about dieting.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S1.mp3">How long have you been on a diet?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S2.mp3">What type of diet are you on?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S3.mp3">Have you lost a lot of weight?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S4.mp3">How much weight have you lost so far?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S5.mp3">How many pounds do you want to lose?</a>"

Remember that most countries use the kilogram system, but the United States uses the pound system. 
Don't ask me why, it's just the way it is.

Here are some ways to answer these types of questions.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S6.mp3">I've been on a diet for 2 months now.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S7.mp3">I'm just watching my calorie intake and doing a little bit of exercise.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S8.mp3">I lost 6 pounds so far.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S9.mp3">My goal is to lose 10 pounds.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S10.mp3">I want to be 105 pounds.</a>"

Currently, the Atkins diet is very popular.

Atkins diet is a low carbohydrate diet that causes the body to burn fat. 
Don't quote me on this though. 
If you want to learn more about Atkins diet, you can find a lot of information over the Internet. 
For now, I'll share with you some sentences that you might hear Americans say about Atkins.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S11.mp3">I'm on the Atkins diet.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S12.mp3">After three days on the Atkins diet, all I think about is bread and rice.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S13.mp3">I lost 15 pounds in 4 weeks due to the Atkins diet.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L76/sentence/L76S14.mp3">I could never go on the Atkins diet. 
I love carbs too much.</a>"

Carbs is the short form of carbohydrate. 
You might hear people say, low carb diet in the place of Atkins.

<h2>Dieting - Specific Areas</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/633-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Another common area about dieting is describing the exact area of where you want to lose weight. 
For some people, they want to lose weight on the arms or the legs, or even on the cheeks. 
Here are some things you may say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L77/sentence/L77S1.mp3">I am going on a diet until I get skinny legs.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L77/sentence/L77S2.mp3">I've been on a diet for 3 months now and I can't get rid of the fat under my arms.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L77/sentence/L77S3.mp3">I hate my love handles. 
I can't seem to get rid of them.</a>"

Love handles are the fat on the side of the stomach.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L77/sentence/L77S14.mp3">The best way to naturally lose weight is to eat five times a day but smaller amounts.</a>"

Talking about other people

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L77/sentence/L77S15.mp3">She used to be so fat in high school. 
I can't believe how skinny she is now.

Let's put all this together and practice with a conversation.

<h2>Dating</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/635-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are several aspects of dating that are important so we will dedicate a couple of lessons on dating. 
There are two sections of dating. 
It comprises of the time period of trying to get a date, and then the time during the date. 
It is also important to point out the differences from the male and female perspectives. 
In this first lesson on dating, we will cover getting a date from both gender perspectives.

In the United States, both genders can ask each other for a date. 
Just like in any culture, it isn't normal to ask a complete stranger for a date. 
Usually, you have to start a conversation and get to know each other a little bit before asking for a date. 
In the beginning, it's normal to engage in small talk. 
During small talk, you should then find something that you have in common. 
The longer you talk, the greater the chance that you will get a date. 
It is all up to how you feel if you want to ask or not. 
In this lesson, I will cover some sentences you should know so you can succeed in getting a date.

Before we continue though, I would like to mention that blind dates are not common. 
For example, in Korea, So-geh-ting is a very popular way to get dates. 
This is in essence a blind date. 
It is not so common in the United States, so no need to cover it here.

During the conversation, throwing out compliments is a good thing to do. 
Most people will be flattered by them. 
But remember not to make them too cheesy.

<b>Compliments to a guy</b>
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S1.mp3">Do you work out at all? You have a nice build.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S2.mp3">What kind of cologne is that? I like the smell of it.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S3.mp3">I like the sound of your voice. 
It's soothing listening to it.</a>"

<b>Compliments to a girl</b>
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S4.mp3">Your eyes stand out a lot. 
Do you get many compliments on them?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S5.mp3">Does it take you long to style your hair? It looks very good.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S6.mp3">I bet you get hit on a lot.</a>"

The term 'hit on' means to be approached by the opposite sex. 
So somebody who gets hit on a lot means to have many people approaching them.

<b>Compliments to either gender</b>
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S7.mp3">It's very comfortable talking to you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S8.mp3">I feel like I can be myself when I'm talking to you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S9.mp3">You seem so intelligent. 
I like that.</a>"

As you can see, these types of compliments are not too aggressive. 
They are implying good things, but are not a burden to hear. 
For example, imagine you are talking to a stranger. 
If they say, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L78/sentence/L78S10.mp3">You're so beautiful.</a>" It will more likely scare you away. 
You will probably think that person is a little crazy. 
But if someone is talking to you and says a small compliment, then it is very welcomed. 
So keep that in mind when throwing out compliments.

<h2>Dating - Follow Up and Flirting</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/636-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If the conversation goes well, and you feel that you have a strong connection, feel free to ask for a date. 
There are a couple of ways to do so. 
You can either ask for a phone number, or you can ask to go out by meeting somewhere. 
When you the conversation is about to end, make sure to bring up the subject of a date.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S1.mp3">It was so great talking to you. 
I would love to get together and chat some more. 
Would you care to have dinner with me sometime?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S2.mp3">If you don't have anything planned for Saturday, I would like to take you to dinner.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S3.mp3">We should talk some more later. 
Can I get your number?</a>"

There are many ways and if you are sincere, then you shouldn't have a problem. 
If you feel you are not sure, or you are scared, then you can leave your phone number and hope that the other person calls.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S4.mp3">I enjoyed talking to you. 
Let me give you my number. 
I would love to hear from you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S5.mp3">Give me a call anytime you want to just chat.</a>"

<b>Flirting</b>

The previous section was more for people who usually start up a conversation before asking a person on a date. 
There are other types of meeting people. 
There is a terminology called flirting that is popular. 
Flirting basically means to make gestures or movements or comments that are a little sexual in nature. 
So if you move your body in a certain way, or you rub the other persons arm slightly, or talk about slightly sexual things, then that is considered flirting.

Flirting is all dependent on both sides. 
It is hard for only one person to do the flirting. 
If that is the case, then the other person usually finds a quick exit out. 
Here are some things people might say while flirting.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S6.mp3">Hey sexy. 
I can't believe I didn't notice you earlier.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S7.mp3">How come you didn't ask me to dance yet?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S8.mp3">You have nice legs.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S9.mp3">I can tell you workout. 
You have a nice body.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L79/sentence/L79S10.mp3">You want to feel my muscles?</a>"

<h2>Dating Part - Asking for a Date</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/637-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In the previous section, we covered talking to someone before getting a date. 
In the next section we are going to work on some sentences you need to say during the date.

As I said previously, there isn't really another dating language. 
Most of it is regular conversation such as small talk, movies, hobbies, school, and work topics.

Let's start where we left off. 
By now, you should have a phone number. 
It is your responsibility to call and get a date. 
Even though you got a phone number doesn't guarantee a date. 
You have to convince the person to actually show up. 
Here is what you should say.

<b>On the phone</b>

Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S1.mp3">Hello.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S2.mp3">Hi. 
Is Janet there?</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S3.mp3">This is Janet.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S4.mp3">Hi Janet. 
This is Mike. 
I met you at the party last Saturday night.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S5.mp3">Oh. 
Hi Mike.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S6.mp3">Did you enjoy the party?</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S7.mp3">I had a great time. 
How about you?</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S8.mp3">The next morning was tough, but it was real fun, especially meeting you.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S9.mp3">It was great meeting you too.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S10.mp3">Can I take you out to dinner followed by a movie or some other thing?</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S11.mp3">Well, I am a little busy with school and all.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S12.mp3">A couple hours shouldn't hurt too much. 
I'll make sure you have a good time. 
If you want, we can talk about your school. 
Maybe I can help you on some topics you are unsure about.</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S13.mp3">Ok. 
Sounds good. 
I'm free this Friday after 6:00. How does that sound to you?</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S14.mp3">That sounds good. 
Do you want to meet somewhere or would you like for me to pick you up?</a>"
Them: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S15.mp3">If you don't mind Italian, I'll meet you at Olive Garden at 6:30 on Friday.</a>"
You: "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S16.mp3">Sounds great. 
I'll see you then.</a>"

Let's analyze this small conversation real quick. 
First, Mike didn't assume that Janet remembered him. 
He reminded Janet where and when they met. 
It isn't a good idea to put someone on the spot right.

Next, Mike asked if Janet had a good time. 
This is a small talk question to break the ice.

Afterwards, Mike gave a small compliment by saying, '... it was real fun, especially meeting you.'

So Mike is giving an indication that he is interested in Janet.

Next, Mike asks for dinner.

Janet's response is important to learn from. 
She knows Mike has interest in her, but she is not too sure. 
When Mike asks for dinner, she is hesitant. 
We see this when she says, 'I am a little busy with school and all.'

Everyone is busy, and Mike knows that this is an excuse of not going out. 
There are many things that Mike can do now.

1.   Mike can put pressure on her without any substance like, 'Come on. 
Let's just go out.' Or he can not even let her completely answer by saying, 'I'll meet you at Olive Garden at 7:00.'
2.   Mike can be a coward and say, 'Ok. 
Well, if you decide to change your mind, give me a call.'
3.   Or Mike can persuade Janet by appealing to her interests.

The number 1 choice doesn't work because putting pressure on someone is not good. 
She might not come, or start with a bad impression. 
Number 2 choice will result in Janet never calling back.

The answer Mike gave is a great answer. 
He is promising that she will have a good time, and also understanding her school interest and promising to talk about her school.

From Janet's perspective, Mike has good manners not pressuring too much, and understanding her interest by talking about her schooling.

<h2>Dating - On the Date</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/638-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When you finally see Janet at the restaurant or another dating place, you should say something right when you see her. 
Here are a few examples

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S1.mp3">I'm glad you showed up.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S2.mp3">You look great.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S3.mp3">Hi Janet. 
It's good seeing you again.</a>"

During the date, you have to make sure the person stays interested. 
This is primarily done by talking about subjects the other person wants to talk about. 
In this case, Janet is concentrating on school. 
Here are some things to say

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S4.mp3">What subject do you find difficult?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S5.mp3">What classes are giving you a hard time?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S6.mp3">Do you like multiple choice questions or short answer questions?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S7.mp3">Do you like writing essays?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S8.mp3">What subjects interest you the most?</a>"

After you find out more information on her interest, then you can say more things about it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S9.mp3">When I was in college, I had a hard time with my writing assignments. 
I guess my high school didn't prepare me enough. 
So I went to the writing center located next to the library, and they helped me tremendously.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S10.mp3">I found psychology to be pretty easy, but I always made stupid mistakes with the multiple choice questions. 
So I got a study guide for it and it helped me to get the minor details out of the way.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S11.mp3">I really like history too. 
I enjoy learning about what happened and how we got to the state we are in now.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S12.mp3">You don't like calculus? I was a math major. 
If you would like, I can help you out with your homework. 
I'm sure after a couple of lessons, you will think it is easy.</a>"

So helping out with homework is another way to get another date. 
Although it will be more geared towards school work, you can take the opportunity to impress the other person.

<h2>Dating - Preparing Activity after Dinner</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/640-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Sometimes a date will end right after dinner. 
Other times you can go to another place such as a bar, or go bowling, or see a movie. 
It is your responsibility to find out what the other person likes to do and then suggest it. 
If the date was strictly for dinner, then it will be difficult, but in this case, Mike suggested a dinner and a movie, or another thing. 
That means Janet should have left the night open.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S1.mp3">Have you seen Master and Commander yet? I heard it was a good movie.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S2.mp3">No, I haven't.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S3.mp3">There is an 8:30 showing down the street. 
Would you like to go see it?</a>"

Mike made sure to look up movie times and locations before the movie. 
Then when he suggests a movie, he has all the information.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S4.mp3">What do you like to do when you are not studying?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S5.mp3">I like to hang out with friends and drink a little and I also like to go bowling sometimes.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S6.mp3">Do you want to go bowling after dinner? We can have a few drinks while we play. 
It will be fun.</a>"

In this scenario, Mike is using both her interests here. 
In the States, they serve alcohol so drinking and bowling together is a great option.

<h2>Dating - Saying Goodbye on Date</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/641-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Finally, when the date is over, you can say a couple of things depending on how the date went.

If it went bad,

You can lie and say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S1.mp3">I had a good time. 
I'll call you sometime.</a>"

Or you can not lie and say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S2.mp3">The dinner and movie was great. 
Have a good night.</a>"

Mike is not lying. 
He is saying the dinner and movie was good but didn't say anything about the date.

If you had a good time, say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S3.mp3">I had a great time tonight. 
Can I call you again?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S4.mp3">We should do this again.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S5.mp3">I really enjoyed spending time with you.</a>"

Common courtesy sentences,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S6.mp3">Make sure to drive safely. 
If you have any problems, feel free to give me a call.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L84/sentence/L84S7.mp3">I hope you had a good time. 
Drive home safely and have a good night.</a>"

<h2>Engagement</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/648-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Engagement is the time period spent before getting married. 
In this lesson, we will learn about English when asking someone to marry and the terminologies when becoming engaged.

When a friend has been together with a boyfriend or girlfriend a long time, they usually ask when they are going to get married, or when they are going to get engaged.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S1.mp3">When are you going to get married?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S2.mp3">When are you going to tie the knot?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S3.mp3">When are you going to settle down?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S4.mp3">When are you going to propose to her?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S5.mp3">When are you going to ask her to marry you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S6.mp3">When do you think he is going to propose?</a>"

After the big question is asked, then the two people are engaged.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S7.mp3">We got engaged last week.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S8.mp3">I got engaged about a month ago.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S9.mp3">We're going to have a short engagement.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S10.mp3">Our engagement is for about 6 months.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S11.mp3">We had an engagement party at a restaurant with both families.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S12.mp3">We really didn't have a formal engagement dinner.</a>"

You can get creative in the ways to ask your significant other to marry you, but the most general way is to simply say,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S13.mp3">Will you marry me?</a>"

These four words cannot be replaced really. 
Mostly, it is how you ask it and in what situation.

When two people are engaged, then they are not boyfriend and girlfriend, instead, they refer to each other as fiancé.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S14.mp3">This is my fiancée.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S15.mp3">She is my fiancée.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S16.mp3">He is my fiancé.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S17.mp3">Where is your fiancé?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L89/sentence/L89S18.mp3">I want to meet your fiancé.</a>"

<h2>Engagement - Proposing</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/649-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Other common type of questions regarding pre-marriage is how a person proposes. 
Here are some examples:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S1.mp3">How are you going to propose to her?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S2.mp3">How do you think he will propose to you?</a>"

I'll list a few answers I heard from other people.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S3.mp3">I'm going to take her to dinner and I'm going to put the ring on top of the dessert. 
So when the cake comes out, she will see the ring.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S4.mp3">I'm going to take her to our favorite restaurant and ask her there.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S5.mp3">I'm going all out. 
First, I'm going to send her to a massage. 
Then, I'm going to have her relax at a coffee shop where I'll send her some flowers. 
After that, I'm going to have her picked up in a limo to a restaurant where I'll be waiting in the entrance on my knees.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S6.mp3">When my husband asked me to marry, he put a ring inside a fortune cookie with a message asking, will you marry me in the cookie.</a>"

Some other types of questions that you might hear:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S8.mp3">Are you sure she is going to say yes?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S9.mp3">Are you sure about this?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S13.mp3">What did you do for your engagement party?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S14.mp3">Did you guys have an engagement party?</a>"

A friend might ask you questions regarding your relationship when the marriage topic comes up.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S15.mp3">How long have you been with her?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S16.mp3">What made you decide to get married?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L90/sentence/L90S17.mp3">Are you sure she is the right one?</a>"

<h2>Engagement - Best man and Maid of honor</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/650-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Preparing for marriage is a time consuming thing with so much to do. 
I'll explain most of it in the next lesson, but I wanted to explain one difference in this lesson. 
In the western culture, they have friends standing next to the bride and groom during the wedding ceremony. 
At a minimum, it is one person. 
That person is called the best man. 
For the lady side, that person is called maid of honor. 
But if you have more than one, you usually have one best man, and multiple grooms men. 
For the ladies, they are called brides maid.

Best man - Best friend or relative of groom usually holding the ring
Grooms men - Other friends or siblings standing next to the best man
Maid of honor - Best friend or relative of the bride usually holding the ring
Brides maid - Other friends or relative standing next to the Maid of honor.

The best man and maid of honor have responsibilities such as taking care of the bride and groom, planning for parties and taking care of the presents, and many other things. 
We'll discuss more about this in the next session. 
Let's move on to practicing the material in this lesson.

<h2>Marriage - Getting a Church</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/652-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this lesson, we will cover the process of marriage and all the things you need to know how to say in English. 
In the previous session, we learned about the engagement and initial wedding procedures. 
Let's now look into more depth at the marriage process.

After two people agree to marry, there are many things to plan. 
There are many different things you can do, and depending on your budget, you will have more or less. 
I will give an example of the marriages I have seen around me.

The first thing you need to do after you set a date is find a church. 
In eastern cultures, marrying in a church is not as popular, but in America, a large percentage of marriages still take place in the church.

You will need to call a church and ask if you can rent there place for a marriage.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L92/sentence/L92S1.mp3">Hello. 
I'm going to get married and I was wondering if you rent out your church for this purpose.</a>"

If they say no, you can say thank you and good bye. 
If they say yes, then you can follow up with more questions.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L92/sentence/L92S2.mp3">I was looking to get married on June 15th. 
Will your church be available on that date?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L92/sentence/L92S3.mp3">What Saturday do you have available in the month of June?</a>"

If timing is an issue, then you will need to tell them the time.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L92/sentence/L92S4.mp3">We would like to get married at 1:00pm. 
Is that ok?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L92/sentence/L92S5.mp3">We would like to get married at 4:00pm. 
Does that time work for you?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L92/sentence/L92S6.mp3">We are pretty flexible with the time so I will take whatever time is available on that date.</a>"

After a date and time is confirmed, they might ask you to meet and get all the details from you.

<h2>Wedding Process - Flowers</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/653-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The next step is for the decoration and flowers.

Friends might ask,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S1.mp3">What kind of flowers are you going to have?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S2.mp3">What color flowers are you going to have?</a>"

You can respond by,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S3.mp3">I'm thinking about white and yellow roses.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S4.mp3">I'm not sure yet, but I'm leaning towards lavender and white roses.</a>"
You will need to call up a flower shop and ask for flowers to be arranged.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S5.mp3">I'm going to get married next June and I would like an estimate for flowers.</a>"

Usually it all depends on your price range so they might ask you how much and how big the wedding will be.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S6.mp3">How many people are you expecting and what is your budget for flowers?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S7.mp3">I am expecting about 150 people and I wanted to stay under one thousand dollars for flowers.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S8.mp3">What types of flowers did you have in mind?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S9.mp3">I want purple and white roses.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L93/sentence/L93S10.mp3">I believe I can provide what you are looking for. 
I can prepare the flowers for the walkway, for the altar, the flower you hold, flowers for the brides maid, and overall decoration. 
Because of your flower selection, it will cost twelve hundred dollars.</a>"

<h2>Wedding Process - Photographer, Dress and Tux</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/654-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Another thing you will have to prepare is the photographer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S1.mp3">How much do you charge for wedding pictures?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S2.mp3">What is included in your wedding package?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S3.mp3">How many years of experience do you have?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S4.mp3">How many weddings have you worked on?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S5.mp3">Do you have samples of wedding pictures you took that I can look at?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S6.mp3">Do you use both color and black and white film?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S7.mp3">Do you provide video service in your wedding package?</a>"

You also need to prepare for the dress for yourself and the dresses for your maid of honor and brides maid. 
Usually this is done talking with friends and family.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S8.mp3">What color do you think we should get for the brides maid dresses?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S9.mp3">What color dress do you think will go well with purple and white roses?</a>"

Candle lighters are another person in the wedding party. 
You might need to get a dress for that person as well.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S10.mp3">Should we have the same dress for the candle lighter or a different dress?</a>"

The men need to get a tuxedo. 
Usually you find a tux shop and they take care of the rest. 
Only instructions you need to give to the best man and grooms men is the location of the place.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S11.mp3">Make sure you go into the Black Tie tuxedo shop next week and get your size measured.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L94/sentence/L94S12.mp3">Go to the tux shop and pick up your tuxedo on the 14th.</a>"

I don't know the rule for who pays for the tux or the dress. 
I've seen it both ways. 
In some weddings, the people wearing the dress or tux pays for it, and in other weddings, I've seen the wedding couple pay for everything.

<h2>Wedding Process - Gifts and Reception</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/655-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In some cultures, wedding present is usually given in the form of money. 
In America, money is rarely given among friends. 
Family might provide financial support, but for presents, it is always a gift bought at a store. 
In order to prevent duplicate gifts or gifts that you don't want, many stores such as The Bon, provide a wedding registry. 
You go and pick all the things you want and they enter it into a computer. 
You tell everyone in the invitation you sent out that the gift registry is at The Bon. 
They will go to The Bon and print out a list of what you have selected. 
If someone bought it already, then that item will not show up.

This is a way to get what you need and makes it easier for the people buying you gifts.

In the store, you simply tell the person:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S1.mp3">I'm going to get married in June and I would like my registry here.</a>"

If you are a person buying a present, then you can ask,

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S2.mp3">My friend is getting married and they registered here. 
Where can I get a list of presents they selected?</a>"

After the church is selected, the flowers have been ordered, and the photographer is reserved, then you have to practice. 
The wedding party usually meets at the church a day or two before the wedding and rehearses the coming day's event. 
After the rehearsal, a rehearsal dinner should be provided.

Don't forget about the reception. 
You have to plan for a reception after the wedding. 
Usually it is a meal at a different location or at the church. 
Again, this is all dependent on how much you can afford. 
An open bar is also an option that many people like. 
An open bar is a bar that people can order drinks for free.

Now that we looked through the process of a wedding, let's work on a few sentences friends say to each other before and during the busy wedding process.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S3.mp3">Planning for a wedding is so time consuming. 
I don't know if I can finish everything on time.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S4.mp3">I'm getting so stressed out. 
It feels like there are a hundred different things to do.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S5.mp3">I think I'm almost done with my wedding plans. 
Although I'm relieved, I now feel anxious about the wedding.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S6.mp3">Did you help your fiancé plan for the wedding?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S7.mp3">You made her do all the work?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S8.mp3">My boyfriend was so helpful. 
He literally did most of the planning.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S9.mp3">Are you going to have the reception at the church or did you reserve another place?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S10.mp3">How much did your wedding cost?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L95/sentence/L95S11.mp3">How much was the reception?</a>"

A wedding is much larger and requires much more planning than I described here. 
I primarily covered the larger items in a broad way. 
This is to give you an idea and a starting point. 
If you have additional questions or specific requests, feel free to ask.

<h2>Honeymoon</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/656-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Honeymoon is a small vacation two married people go to right after the wedding. 
It doesn't have to be right after the wedding though. 
I know some people who hold off the honeymoon until the summer, or if they are in school, until school is complete.

Discussing with your partner where to go for the honeymoon

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L96/sentence/L96S1.mp3">Where should we go for our honeymoon?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L96/sentence/L96S22.mp3">We only have two thousand dollars so we have to go somewhere inexpensive.</a>"

These sentences are used when talking to a friend before the honeymoon

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S6.mp3">Do you have everything planned out already?</a>"

<b>Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S7.mp3">We decided to go to Hawaii.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S8.mp3">We're going to the Greek Islands.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S11.mp3">Mostly to relax. 
The wedding took a lot out of me so I just want to vege out.</a>"

'Vege out' means to be a vegetable. 
That means not using the head at all. 
When you say this, you are saying you don't want to do anything except relax. 
Another common way to use this is to say, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S12.mp3">I'm vege-ing out in front of the TV.</a>" That means you are watching TV not thinking about anything.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S13.mp3">We're going the day after the wedding.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S14.mp3">We're leaving right after the wedding.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S15.mp3">We're going to the airport after the reception.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S17.mp3">We're going to go in September because I need to finish summer school first.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S18.mp3">My parents are going to take us to the airport.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S19.mp3">John agreed to drive us to the airport.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S20.mp3">I think we have everything planned out. 
I'm not missing anything am I?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L98/sentence/L98S21.mp3">We didn't do much planning. 
I just got the plane tickets and booked a room at the hotel. 
Besides that, we are just going to wing it.</a>"

'Wing it' means to play it by ear. 
Or in other words, do things without planning or do things as they come along.

<h2>Married Life - Talking about a Friend</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/663-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Talking about a friends marriage
There are some terminologies used when a man is controlled by his wife. 
For example, if a friend cannot come out because the wife said no, or if he needs to get permission for everything, then these words apply to him.

Attached to a ball and chain - Ball and Chain refers to the wife. 
The ball and chain is the old type of device used to lock somebody up. 
You put a chain around the leg that has a large heavy metal ball attached to it so they cannot move.

Here are some example sentences:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L102/sentence/L102S1.mp3">Ever since he got married, he has been imprisoned in his house. 
He never comes out anymore.</a>"

<b>Affair and cheating</b>

In a marriage, having an affair and cheating on one another is a topic we'll discuss. 
Hopefully in your marriage you won't need to discuss this. 
But use this as a reference for when you see it on TV or something.

<b>Accusing</b>

<h2>Health - Dating - Marriage Review</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/666-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Up until now, we have covered quite a bit. 
If you have made it this far, I want to congratulate you for your persistence. 
There are no cutting corners in learning English so you should take it step by step and learn all the material I am presenting. 
So let's move forward and review what we have learned so far.

<h2>Sports in General</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/672-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Sports is a common topic mostly among the guys. 
In America, the three biggest sports are baseball, basketball, and American football. 
Due to the popularity of these sports, I will have individual lessons for them, but I will not have individual lessons for other sports such as soccer, volleyball, etc. 
For this lesson however, I will briefly talk about most sports and the most common language used among each one.

First, let's practice general sports sentences:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S1.mp3">What do you like to do in your free time?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S2.mp3">What are your hobbies?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S3.mp3">What sports do you like to play?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S4.mp3">I like to play sports. 
It's good for my health and I think it's very fun.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S5.mp3">I like competitive sports because winning feels good.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S6.mp3">I like to play tennis and I like to swim.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S7.mp3">Jeff is pretty athletic so he picks up on sports real quick.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S8.mp3">If you need a girl to play, you should get Jessica. 
She's very athletic.</a>"

In English, you can mostly use the word play for a sport, but there are some sports where play doesn't work. 
Here are some examples:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S9.mp3">I like to play basketball.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S10.mp3">Let's go play basketball.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S11.mp3">Do you like to play basketball?</a>"

This would also work for football, baseball, tennis, volleyball, soccer, and softball.
However, sports such as swimming, bowling, and golf do not use the word play. 
Here is how you would say it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S12.mp3">I like to swim.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S13.mp3">I like swimming.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S14.mp3">Let's go swimming.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L108/sentence/L108S15.mp3">Do you like swimming?</a>"

As you may have noticed, each of the sports that do not use play is the ones with an 'ing' at the end. 
So if the sport is primarily used with an 'ing' at the end, then do not use play with that sport name.

<h2>Sports in General - Volleyball</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/673-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are many different types of sports but I will primarily talk about the following in this lesson:

Volleyball
Soccer
Swimming
Softball
Tennis

<b>Volleyball</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L109/sentence/L109S1.mp3">I play volleyball on our high school team.</a>"

Two six rotation is a terminology used in volleyball where there are two setters. 
They take turns and the person who is in the back is the setter, so they should be opposite of each other in the lineup.

The ball is spinning like mad.</a>"

<h2>Baseball - Topics</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/680-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Topics in baseball</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S1.mp3">I can't believe how much players make.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S2.mp3">I don't like Alex Rodriguez because he followed money instead of going to a good team.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S3.mp3">The biggest contract ever was signed by Alex Rodriguez. 
It was a 10 year deal for two hundred and fifty million dollars.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S4.mp3">Most good players usually make above five million dollars a year.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S5.mp3">Baseball doesn't have a salary cap. 
That's why the Yankees are so powerful. 
They have the money to buy all the good players.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S6.mp3">I think baseball would be more fair if there was a salary cap.</a>"
Although grammatically, fairer is more correct than more fair, it is common to use it this way when speaking. 
It is based on sound and flow of sentence. 
Using more in front of fair is emphasizing more.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S7.mp3">The difference between National league and American league is that the pitcher doesn't bat in American League. 
They have a designated hitter that bats for the pitcher.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S8.mp3">It's good that Byung Hyun Kim went to the American league. 
He wasn't a good batter.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L116/sentence/L116S9.mp3">Byung Hyun Kim was at a Seattle night club the other weekend.</a>"

<h2>Baseball - Baseball Cards</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/681-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Collecting baseball cards</b>

In America, baseball cards have monetary value depending on how good the player is. 
So there are some serious baseball card collectors who have thousands of baseball cards. 
But for the average person, having a couple of baseball cards of your favorite player is good enough. 
If you want to find a baseball card for a specific player, you can find them at a baseball card store.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L117/sentence/L117S1.mp3">Do you have any Chan Ho Park cards?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L117/sentence/L117S2.mp3">I'm looking for Byung Hyun Kim's rookie card.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L117/sentence/L117S3.mp3">How much is this card worth?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L117/sentence/L117S4.mp3">What is the value of this card?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L117/sentence/L117S5.mp3">Do you have a case I can store this card in?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L118/sentence/L118S1.mp3">Where is the baseball section?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L118/sentence/L118S2.mp3">Where can I find baseball bats?</a>"

<h2>Baseball - Amateur League</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/683-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Many people like to play baseball even after growing up. 
But they are not good enough to play in a professional league, so they have amateur leagues for fun. 
Most major cities will have recreational league and if you are looking for one, you will need to call up the city. 
Do a search in the Internet for Parks and Community Services for your city name, or Parks and Recreation. 
Here is an example on a small city of Lynnwood. 
In the search engine, I type, 'Lynnwood Parks and Recreation'. You should see some links and they should have phone numbers. 
Call that number and ask how you can join a baseball team.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S1.mp3">Hi, I wanted to join an adult baseball league. 
Do you have these events?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S2.mp3">When are signups?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S3.mp3">What process do I need to take to join a team?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S4.mp3">When does the season start?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S5.mp3">How much does it cost?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S6.mp3">What days and times do teams usually play?</a>"

For most adults, we like to watch baseball, so you might not have to go through the above process. 
However, when you get a kid, your son might want to play.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S7.mp3">I'm looking for a baseball league for my 10 year old son. 
Where can I find information on little league?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L119/sentence/L119S8.mp3">Where can I sign up my 8 year old son to play baseball?</a>"

Most of the time, your son might have friends and they will sign up with your permission. 
But if you have to find it, you can use the sentences we have learned right above to find a team for your son.

<h2>Football</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/691-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Football is referred to as soccer in most countries, but in America, football is different than soccer. 
That is why I sometimes refer to football as American football. 
American football is not popular worldwide yet, but it's very popular in America. 
The Superbowl is the most watched sports event. 
To buy commercial time during the Superbowl is the most expensive.

In this lesson, I'll give you some pointers on having a football conversation, and I will also explain some rules. 
Let's start with the rules first because not everyone will know them. 
I will not be too specific because this isn't a lesson on football rules. 
Rather, I will give a brief description so you have an understanding of the game before we move on to the conversation aspect.

There are eleven players on the field for each side. 
That means you need 22 people to play an official football game. 
The point of the game is to reach the other side, which is called the end zone, with the ball. 
A player can run with the ball, or they can throw the ball to another person.

Touchdown is worth 6 points.

If you are close enough but not quite in the end zone, you can kick the ball. 
That is called a field goal.

Field goals are worth 3 points.

After you make a touchdown, you can either kick a ball, similar to a field goal for 1 point or you can run or pass it for 2 points. 
This is called a two point conversion.

Quarterback always starts with the ball. 
He either passes it to a wide receiver, hands off to a running back, or runs the ball himself.

<b>Offense positions:</b>

Center - The person hiking the ball to the quarterback each play.
Quarterback - The main person starting with the ball each play. 
Either passes, hands off, or runs.
Running back - The person who runs with the ball. 
Running backs can catch passes as well.
Wide Receivers - The people who run out and catch balls from the quarterback.
Tight End - Similar to a wide receiver but blocks a lot as well.
Full back - Like a running back who runs with the ball, but mostly blocks for the main running back.
Offensive Guard - blocks for the quarterback positioned right next to the Center on each side
Offensive Tackle - same as the guard and standing right next to the guard

<b>Defense positions:</b>

Nose Tackle - Person in the middle facing the center
Defensive Guard and Tackle - Opposite the offensive guard and tackle
Linebacker - People right behind the front line.
Cornerbacks - People on the sides of linebackers. 
Primarily covers the wide receivers and outside running plays.
Safety - People behind the cornerbacks who covers wide receiver and passing plays

The object for the offense is to get in the end zone. 
The goal of the defense is to prevent the offense from getting in the end zone. 
A defensive person is always trying to tackle the person who has the ball. 
If the person goes down to the ground with the ball, then that play is over.

There are four downs. 
After four downs, your team no longer has possession of the ball. 
If you gain 10 yards before the four downs are used, then you start with four downs again.

Usually on first down, they call it first and ten. 
That means it is the first down, and I need ten yards to regain first down. 
If on the first play I only get one yard, then the next down is called second and nine. 
It is the second play and I need 9 yards more. 
On the second down, I get 5 yards, then it is third and 4. And on third down if I get 5 more yards, I have succeeded in getting 10 yards, and it is first and 10 once again. 
You continue to do this until you either get a touch down or get a field goal or fail to reach 10 yards in four plays.

On the fourth down, your team can punt the ball. 
Punting the ball is used because you do not think you can get first down and punting the ball would move the other team further away from their end zone, making it harder for them. 
To punt the ball, a punter grabs the football and kicks it as high and as far as possible.

There are many other rules, but I think this much explanation will be sufficient to understand a little about American football. 
Let's move on to speaking about this topic now.

<b>Talking about people you see</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L127/sentence/L127S1.mp3">I saw a guy in a restaurant. 
He was huge man. 
Towering over everyone. 
I got the nerve to ask him if he played football, and he ended up being a professional football player for the Seahawks.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L127/sentence/L127S2.mp3">I saw a professional football player last week at a night club. 
All the girls were around him.</a>"

<h2>Golf - Terminologies</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/695-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Golf is a sport that is increasing in popularity. 
This is more true for Asian countries with many great golfers coming from Korea, Japan, and China. 
Golf is also great because it is a sport for all ages and both genders. 
In this lesson, we will cover all the things you need to know to have a great conversation about golf.

Before we start, let's cover some terminologies and equipment

Iron set - A typical set of irons consist of a pitching wedge and 3 through 9 irons
5 wood - Fairway wood designed to hit the ball a little farther than the 3 iron
3 wood - Fairway wood designed to hit the ball a little farther than the 5 wood
Driver - The club used to hit the ball the farthest off the Tee
Putter - The club used to putt the ball in the cup

Tee box - The place where you hit your first shot
Fairway - The short grass area in the middle
Rough - Taller grass next to the fairway that is not in the middle
Green - The area where the hole is and where you putt the ball.

Par 3 - Short holes where it should take 3 shots to get in the cup
Par 4 - Middle length holes where it should take 4 shots
Par 5 - Long holes where it should take 5 shots

Hole in one - When the ball goes in the cup on the first hit. 
Usually only on par 3's.
Double Eagle - Ball goes in the cup after hitting the ball twice on a par 5. 3 under par
Eagle - Ball goes in the cup after hitting the ball 3 times on a par 5 or 2 times on a par 4. 2 under par

So on a par 3, you reached the cup in 2, par 4, you reached in 3, and par 5, you reached in 4.
Par - When you put the ball in the cup in the number specified by the par. 
Par 3, in three, par 4 in four shots, and par 5 in five shots

Poker is also something a person can do in a casino without friends. 
I will cover all the things you need to say to be effective with your English at the poker table.

There are many different poker games. 
I will not cover the different types of poker games, but feel free to learn about them through poker books or other poker web sites. 
For this lesson, I will use Texas Hold 'em as the example game because of its popularity.

First, let's look at some terminologies:

No Pair - A hand without anything.
One Pair - Having two of the same card
Two Pair - Having two sets of pair
Three of a kind - Having three of the same card
Straight - Having five number or face cards in a row
Flush - Having all 5 cards with the same suit
Full house (another name is 'boat') - Three of a kind and a pair together
Four of a kind - Four of the same card
Straight flush - Five number or face cards in a row all in the same suit
Royal flush - 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace all in the same suit

Wheel - A straight consisting of Ace, 2, 3, 4, and 5

<b>Betting</b>

Check - When it is your turn and you don't want to bet anything
Call - When someone in front of you bets and you want to match to stay in the game. 
Other terminology for call is 'see.'
Fold - Dying or forfeiting your hand because you don't want to pay anymore. 
Other terminologies for this are, mucking your hand, dying, and out.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L131/sentence/L131S1.mp3">I fold.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L131/sentence/L131S2.mp3">He mucked his hand.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L131/sentence/L131S3.mp3">I'm out.</a>"

Raise - When someone in front of you bets and you want to put in more money.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L131/sentence/L131S4.mp3">I see (call) your ten, and I raise you another ten.</a>"

<h2>Poker - Texas Hold 'em Instructions</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/700-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Texas Hold 'em is the most popular poker game in America. 
Here is a brief explanation on how to play Texas Hold 'em.

1. Everyone is given two cards
2. Betting takes place
3. Dealer burns (throws away) a card and then places three cards in the middle. 
Everyone can use the cards in the middle.
4. Betting takes place
5. Dealer burns another card and shows one more card
6. Betting takes place
7. Dealer burns another card and shows one last card
8. Final betting and then everyone shows their hand.

You have 2 cards in your hand and a total of 5 cards in the middle. 
Out of the seven cards, you can use any 5 cards to make your poker hand.

In step 3 above, the first three cards that are turned over is called the 'flop.'

In step 5, the single card that is shown is called the 'turn.'

In step 7, the final card that is shown is called the 'river.'

This is all the explanation I will give. 
Don't rely on this to learn the game. 
I am only telling you this information so you can understand the lesson.

<b>Talking with friends</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S1.mp3">Let's play poker.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S2.mp3">When do you guys want to play poker?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S3.mp3">I'm going to have people over at my place to play poker. 
Do you want to come?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S4.mp3">We're playing poker at Tim's place tonight.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S5.mp3">Are you any good at poker?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S6.mp3">Have you played poker before?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S7.mp3">Do you know how to play poker?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S8.mp3">It's boring when people play so conservatively.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S9.mp3">It takes too much time to play if people keep folding like this.</a>"

<b>Talking about poker</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S10.mp3">I had three Kings on the flop but I couldn't fill up. 
I got beat with a flush that showed up on the river.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S11.mp3">I went 'all in' with a pair of aces before the flop. 
I lost to a guy who called with a pair of fours. 
Another four came out and I was out of the game.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S12.mp3">I can't believe he got so lucky.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S13.mp3">Jerry is so lucky. 
He always gets the cards he needs.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S14.mp3">I shouldn't have called.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S15.mp3">I shouldn't have folded. 
I would have won.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S16.mp3">Where's the courtesy show.</a>" - This statement is commonly used when somebody wins because everyone else folded. 
Then the other people will ask to see the cards. 
Most of the time, the player will not show his hand. 
So a courtesy show is showing your hand when you don't have to.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S17.mp3">He bought the pot.</a>" - When somebody wins because nobody called. 
They say he bought the pot because he bet very high and nobody wanted to risk it. 
So his high bid bought the pot.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S18.mp3">I knew I won because I got a full house on the 'turn'.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S19.mp3">I would have won this hand too. 
I am such a chicken.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S20.mp3">What did you have?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S21.mp3">I can't believe I lost with a straight. 
The damn flush showed up on the river.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S22.mp3">I had two aces and he had two kings. 
The last card was a king so he won.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S23.mp3">Would you go all in with a pair of fours before the flop?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S24.mp3">Would you rather have a pair of fives or an Ace King suited.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L133/sentence/L133S25.mp3">You're so easy to read. 
You give your hand away every time.</a>"

Talking about guys is a little different than talking about girls. 
When guys talk about girls, they mostly talk about their body and looks. 
Although girls talk about guys in this manner as well, we mostly talk about personality, job, status, and things unrelated to looks. 
So, in this lesson, we will cover both looks and character of guys and what girls say to each other.

<h2>Shopping - Clothes</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/708-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

A few guys like to shop. 
As for the girls, most of them enjoy shopping. 
Shopping can consist of grocery shopping, clothes shopping, or present shopping. 
I'm sure there are other types as well, but I will limit this lesson to these three types of shopping.

<b>Shopping for clothes</b>

'Window Shopping' is a terminology used when you do not plan on buying anything. 
Basically, you are only looking. 
The term 'window shopping' was created because a lot of stores have mannequins on display in the window with clothes on them. 
So walking by the store and looking at the clothing through the window is a way to see what they have. 
This is called 'window shopping.'

Mannequins are the fake life size figures that are used to put and display clothes. 
Most department stores show clothing with the mannequins.

Here are some common statements and questions most commonly used in a clothing store.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L138/sentence/L138S1.mp3">Where is the dressing room?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L138/sentence/L138S2.mp3">I can't find my size here. 
Can you check if you have this in a size 4?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L138/sentence/L138S3.mp3">Do you have this in different colors?</a>"

<h2>Shopping - Grocery</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/709-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Grocery shopping is a common thing that is done at least on a weekly basis. 
I'll cover some general sentences that are commonly used.

<b>Before shopping</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S1.mp3">I'm going to the grocery store. 
Do you need anything?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S2.mp3">I'm going to QFC. 
Do you want to go?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S3.mp3">Did you create a grocery list?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S4.mp3">I'm going to Safeway tonight. 
Let me know if you need anything by 5:30.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S5.mp3">Let's go to the grocery store together.</a>"

Many large grocery stores have coupons they distribute through the newspaper. 
You cut them out and save money on items that are shown in the coupon.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S6.mp3">I have a bunch of coupons I got from the newspaper.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S7.mp3">There were a lot of coupons, but I didn't need any of them.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S8.mp3">There are no coupons for anything I ever buy.</a>"

<b>During grocery shopping</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L139/sentence/L139S9.mp3">Where is your bread section?</a>"

<h2>Shopping - Presents</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/710-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Shopping for presents</b>

Almost everyone needs to buy a present. 
Let's look at some sentences that you will need.

It's common to ask a birthday person what they want.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S1.mp3">What do you want for your birthday?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S2.mp3">Do you need anything?</a>"

Or, you can ask a friend of a birthday person.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S3.mp3">What do you think John wants for his birthday?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S4.mp3">What do you think I should get for John?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S5.mp3">What are you getting John for his birthday?</a>"

Buying something for a girlfriend or boyfriend is a little different. 
If you don't have any ideas, then you can ask a sales person. 
Let's say you want to buy your girlfriend a piece of jewelry.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S6.mp3">I want to buy my girlfriend a birthday present. 
Do you have any suggestions?</a>"

Or if you want to buy a boyfriend a tie or a shirt, you can go to a place like Banana Republic and ask them.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L140/sentence/L140S7.mp3">I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday. 
Can you help me pick out something?</a>"

<h2>Jewelry</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/712-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are many types of jewelry, but the ones I will focus on are the ring, necklace, earring, bracelet, and watch. 
Although watch can be in a category by itself, we will include it in this section until a separate section is created.

Conversation is usually started with a person complimenting a piece of jewelry. 
Here are some examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S1.mp3">That's a beautiful necklace.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S2.mp3">What a magnificent ring.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S3.mp3">I like the design of your ring.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S4.mp3">Your bracelet is very nice.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S5.mp3">I love your watch.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S6.mp3">What a beautiful pair of earrings.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S7.mp3">Where did you get your necklace from?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S8.mp3">What is the carat on your diamond ring?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S9.mp3">Is that your wedding ring?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S10.mp3">What type of diamond is that?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S11.mp3">What is the make of your watch?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S12.mp3">Is that white gold, silver, or platinum?</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S13.mp3">Is your gold ring 14 carats or 18 carats?</a>"

Carat is a unit of measurement for gold or diamond. 
24 carat is pure gold and 50 percent of pure gold is 12 carats. 
Diamonds use carat to determine size. 
One carat is considered to be pretty big. 
While getting past 3 carats will be uncommon for the general people because of the large size.

Answering a compliment is very easy. 
All you need to say is, 'Thank you.' But if you want to elaborate, you can say the following things.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S14.mp3">Thank you. 
My husband got it for me for our anniversary.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S15.mp3">Thank you. 
It was a present from my boyfriend.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S16.mp3">Do you like it? My grandmother gave it to me.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S17.mp3">This is a Rolex. 
My husband and I got a matching pair for our wedding.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L141/sentence/L141S18.mp3">This is a Cartier. 
I bought it last summer.</a>"

<h2>Anger - Other</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/725-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

If you make good friends, you can avoid these types of scenarios. 
However, there are times when the situation was out of your control. 
For example, a friend of mine had to landscape his back yard for his house, so he called a company to delivery a lot of top soil. 
As the driver was driving back to the house, he hit my friends house and damaged a pipeline. 
The driver claimed it wasn't his fault and said he wouldn't pay for the damages. 
When things like this happen, we use the court system to get payment. 
But my friend was so angry because they were not accepting fault. 
Here are some of the things I heard.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S2.mp3">I was so pissed for a couple of weeks. 
During that time, I thought of twenty different ways I could hurt his business.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S3.mp3">I'm going to screw with him so much.</a>"

In the end, everything worked out. 
They went to court and my friend won.

There are a couple of other emotions that are similar to being angry. 
I'll cover some of them here.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S4.mp3">I'm so frustrated.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S5.mp3">It's so frustrating working with him.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S6.mp3">I was so frustrated, I stopped caring about the outcome.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S7.mp3">He gets frustrated pretty easily.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S8.mp3">It's easy to get frustrated when things are not fair.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S9.mp3">I'm not really mad, just a little disappointed.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S10.mp3">That really hurt me. 
I'm so disappointed.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S11.mp3">I'm really disappointed in you. 
I didn't know you could stoop to that level.</a>"

In boxing, a low blow is a hit below the belt that is considered unfair. 
The term low blow became widely used when someone did something unfair. 
Here are some sentences to give you an idea.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S12.mp3">That was low.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L151/sentence/L151S13.mp3">I can't believe Jackie would do something so low.</a>"

Now that we know what low means, stooping to that level means to do something that is low. 
You are basically lowering yourself to perform a bad or unfair task.

<h2>Sad or Depressed</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/740-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

It's unfortunate that there seems to be more negative emotion than positive ones. 
Being sad and depressed is a common emotion that we must deal with. 
While dealing with these negative emotions, it is good to talk about how you feel. 
Let's get started so you can say how bad you feel in English.

I'm not going to cover feeling sad or depressed due to a broken heart in this lesson. 
Having a broken heart is a large topic so I will dedicate a whole lesson to the broken heart.

There are several ways to express you are sad by using different words. 
Here is a small list of different words you might hear.

Sad
Down
Gloomy
Feeling Blue

Sometimes sadness can turn into anger. 
For example, when the US gets away with gold medals at the cost of Koreans or other countries, it's sad to see. 
After the initial feeling, it turns into anger.

<h2>Sad or Depressed - Situational Depression</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/742-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Depression is classified as a disease. 
Many people suffer from depression and it is good to know how to say some sentences whether it is you or someone else.

<b>Situational depression</b>

When someone first comes to the United States, it is common to be depressed. 
This is usually due to loneliness, boredom, or feeling sad because you miss your friends and family.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L164/sentence/L164S1.mp3">I think I'm depressed because I have nothing to do here.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L164/sentence/L164S2.mp3">I'm depressed because I don't have anything here.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L164/sentence/L164S3.mp3">I'm so lonely here. 
I left all my friends to come here.</a>"

Usually time heals these types of problems. 
Sometimes, whatever you say doesn't really help. 
They know the problem, but they can't control how they feel. 
Regardless, saying that you understand can show them that you care.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L164/sentence/L164S4.mp3">It must be really tough leaving your friends and family behind.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L164/sentence/L164S5.mp3">I have never experienced that, but I imagine it must be really hard.</a>"

It's normal to feel this way.

Things to say to a doctor

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L165/sentence/L165S1.mp3">I'm always depressed for no reason.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L165/sentence/L165S2.mp3">I suffer from depression constantly.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L165/sentence/L165S3.mp3">I'm always depressed and I don't know why.</a>"

Depression can be so bad that suicidal thoughts can arise. 
That's what doctors are there for and they can really help. 
But it is important to let someone know about how you feel.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L165/sentence/L165S4.mp3">I'm so depressed that I don't know if it's worth living any longer.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L165/sentence/L165S5.mp3">Can you do anything to help my depression?</a>"

If a friend talks to you about these things, here are some sentences you can say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L165/sentence/L165S6.mp3">It's not your fault and this is pretty serious.

<h2>Love - Family</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/745-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

There are several types of love. 
There is the love you have for your parents or children, the love you have for your wife or husband, the love you feel for a new girlfriend or a boyfriend, and the love you have for a friend. 
These are the primary things I will cover here. 
If you are curious about other types, feel free to ask specific questions and we will tell you the English equivalent. 
For now, let's talk about love.

<b>Family love</b>

I heard that the most unselfish love is the love from the mother to her child. 
It must be powerful and if you are a mother, you will probably understand. 
It's not common to talk to your mother or father about how much they love you. 
It is more common to talk to friends about this. 
Here are some sentences for this conversation.

<b>Talking to friends about parents</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S1.mp3">I can't believe how much parents love their children.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S2.mp3">Although my mother always nags at me, I know she loves me so much.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S3.mp3">I'm amazed at how much my parents gave up to give me a better life.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S4.mp3">I'm such a bad daughter. 
After realizing how much my parents gave me, I feel so sad that I didn't show my appreciation.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S5.mp3">I think you will understand how much your parents love you when you get your own children.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S6.mp3">When my parents can't take care of themselves, I will feel happy to take care of them. 
It's the least I can do to repay all that they gave me.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S7.mp3">I don't know what I would do if I lost my child.</a>"

Even before my son was born, I had this bond with him that I couldn't understand.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L166/sentence/L166S11.mp3">I'm going to do everything for my child.</a>"

<h2>Love - Friend and Husband and Wife</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/746-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Love for a Friend</b>

Some countries have a word for love between friends. 
For example, in Korean, the word is called Jung. 
The English language doesn't have this word. 
Basically when you feel love for a friend, you care for them deeply. 
You should understand that when someone says 'I love you' between friends, it doesn't imply anything sexual.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S1.mp3">Jackie is my best friend. 
I love her so much.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S2.mp3">You're such a good friend. 
I love you man.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S3.mp3">Suzie is the sweetest person. 
I love her to death.</a>"

<b>Love between Husband and Wife</b>

Love between the husband and wife loses the initial bubbly feeling, but it becomes more powerful and more solid. 
It's easy to express how you feel by three simple words.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S4.mp3">I love you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S5.mp3">After 5 years, I love you more than ever.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S6.mp3">I love you more now than I ever have.</a>"

Other ways to express your love without saying 'I love you.'

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S7.mp3">I don't know if I could go on with you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S8.mp3">You need to take care of yourself better. 
I don't want to lose you early.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S9.mp3">You mean more to me than anything in the world.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L167/sentence/L167S10.mp3">I wouldn't be able to live if something happened to you.</a>"

<h2>Love - Infatuation or Love</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/747-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<b>Between a new boyfriend or girlfriend</b>

Many people mistake infatuation for love. 
When you first meet someone and you feel you are in love with that person, it's not really love. 
Love takes time to grow. 
Your infatuation and lust can turn into love after you get to know one another. 
But if you feel this bubbly sensation inside and can't think about anything except the other person, then it's merely infatuation. 
However, this infatuation is so powerful that it drives people crazy. 
The next section will provide many different example sentences. 
Let's take a look at this powerful feeling.

<b>Things initially said</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L168/sentence/L168S1.mp3">My days are empty without you by my side.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L168/sentence/L168S2.mp3">I can't say I love you because what I feel inside is more than love.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L168/sentence/L168S3.mp3">I don't think it's possible to feel more love than I have for you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L168/sentence/L168S4.mp3">My feelings are so strong that even when we are apart, I think you can feel my love for you.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L168/sentence/L168S5.mp3">In the cold lonely night, the sound of your name comforts me.</a>"

Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?</a>"

It is also good to talk about your experience and how you overcame the pain. 
If they see that you experienced it too, they will be more receptive to what you have to say.

Some people really don't get scared that much.

Let's begin.

There are several synonyms for scared that are commonly used.

Frightened

<h2>Other Emotions - Emotional</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/757-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

In this lesson, we will cover several emotions we didn't cover yet. 
The ones I want to talk about are, being emotional, feeling no emotions, restlessness, proud, and anxiety. 
If you have questions concerning any emotion we didn't cover, feel free to ask questions anytime.

<b>Emotional</b>

If your emotions change easily, then you are an emotional person. 
An emotional person can also be described as one who is affected by things such as sad movies, criticism, or easily angered. 
In this lesson, we will go through some sentences talking about emotional people.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S1.mp3">I know a lot of artists and many of them are emotional. 
I think it helps them with their creativity.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S2.mp3">I saw a guy cry in a movie. 
He must be very emotional.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S3.mp3">Emotional girls are high maintenance. 
It's really a headache dealing with them.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S4.mp3">My last boyfriend was so emotional. 
His emotions would change drastically in the same day.</a>"

When someone is way too emotional and it affects how they act in a negative way, some people will call them a psycho.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S5.mp3">Your ex-girlfriend was a total psycho man.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S6.mp3">He's a psycho.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S7.mp3">My last girlfriend was a psycho.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S8.mp3">I had a jealous boyfriend. 
He followed me around everywhere. 
I thought he was emotional because he would cry when I would yell at him, but I now think he's a psycho.</a>"

Some people are only emotional when it is about something they are passionate about. 
If a person only gets emotional talking about one subject, then they are not an emotional person, rather, they are emotional about that topic.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S9.mp3">He's pretty emotional about that topic.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S10.mp3">I wouldn't say anything negative about blind people.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L175/sentence/L175S11.mp3">Anytime we talk about it, he gets very emotional.</a>"

I didn't know he was emotional about it.</a>"

If you have made it this far, you should really be proud of yourself. 
You are on your way to speaking English with ease. 
For this milestone, we are going to have conversation scenarios that incorporate everything we have learned up to this point. 
If you feel you are slow or having to think too much, feel free to return to previous lessons and review them again. 
You don't have to use the exact sentence or wording. 
There are numerous ways to say one thing. 
But make sure you are saying it correctly. 
The sentences here are all correct. 
If you have a sentence of your own, feel free to ask if it is correct.

<h2>Dating - Asking for Second Date</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/767-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

Another way to get another date is by suggesting another restaurant. 
Janet likes Italian restaurants. 
But she chose Olive Garden. 
If the date went well, and you know of another Italian restaurant, you can suggest another date near the end of dinner.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S1.mp3">Is Italian one of your favorite types of food?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S2.mp3">Yeah. 
I like all types of pasta.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S3.mp3">I know this great little Italian restaurant on the waterfront. 
It's small but very authentic. 
I'd love to take you there next week or something.</a>"

Or, if you know of another type of restaurant here is what you can say.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S4.mp3">Have you ever had French food?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S5.mp3">I've had French Fries before.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S6.mp3">I'm talking about real French food.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S7.mp3">No. 
I don't even know what is considered French food.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S8.mp3">I've been to this great French restaurant a couple of months ago. 
The food was amazing. 
I would like to take you there sometime. 
Would you be interested?</a>"

I've only been here for two years. 
I can't see myself doing this for another two years. 
I want to gain more experience in other areas."
B: "Have you brought this up to the boss? Maybe you can go into management."
A: "They usually want a person with an MBA degree or a person willing to put in 80 hours a week."
B: "That's what it takes man. 
Either this or that."
A: "Yeah. 
I better think about what I want. 
Why didn't you go into management?"
B: "It would have taken too much time. 
I have a family that I want to spend time with, so it wasn't worth it for me. 
But you're single. 
You can put in a few good years and put yourself in a good position before thinking about settling down."
A: "You have a point. 
I'll see what my options are. 
Hopefully the manager will help me out with my career."
B: "She's pretty cool about that. 
Just be honest with her and she'll show you some doors."
A: "That sounds good. 
Thanks for the advice."
B: "No problem. 
Good luck."

B: "Yeah. 
I already reviewed them. 
It was pretty good."
A: "Since it was my first project, I was wondering if I can get some feedback."
B: "Well, you finished the project on time. 
And seeing how it was your first assignment, you did very well."
A: "Thanks. 
If it wasn't my first assignment, where do you think I need to improve?"
B: "That's a fair question... I think you could have spent a little more time documenting the difference between Process A and Process B. 
You showed a lot of the similarities, but lacking a little on the differences."
A: "I'll keep that in mind. 
How about the structure? I changed the template a little because I wanted to add a section for recommendation."
B: "I liked the addition. 
Usually people just enter it into the comment section on the bottom but having a clear section makes it stand out. 
That was good."
A: "Was there anything else? I like to get feedback early so I can improve."
B: "No problem. 
Everything else on the assignment was great. 
The only other tip I can give you is sending me more updates. 
If I knew you were stuck on section C for a while, I could have saved you a lot of time. 
So keep me aware on your status."
A: "That makes sense. 
I'll do that. 
Thanks for the feedback."
B: "Don't mention it. 
And good job on the assignment."
A: "Thanks."

I completed Project A and didn't have anything else to work on. 
Should I find something to do, or did you have something lined up?"
B: "I won't have another assignment for you until next Monday. 
What will you be doing until then?"
A: "I'm not sure, I was thinking about investigating the reporting issue we are having, but that's a low priority now. 
But if there is nothing else to do, it might be good to finally fix that."
B: "How about John? He told me that he needed a little help on Project C. 
Why don't you ask him if he still needs help? If not, then check out the reporting issue."
A: "John? I've been meaning to talk to you about him."
B: "What's the problem?"
A: "I don't want to be out of line, but he's very difficult to work with. 
He looks over my shoulder all the time and doesn't like how I am doing things."
B: "Yeah. 
He is like that. 
I appreciate your feedback, and you are not the first to bring this up. 
Although he is difficult, he does get a lot of work done around here."
A: "I completely agree, and I will continue to work with him as well as I can. 
I just thought I should let you know instead of keeping it bottled up."
B: "I appreciate your honesty. 
But for now, you're going to have to tolerate his methods a little longer. 
I'll see if the director is willing to have a talk with John about this problem."
A: "Ok. 
Well, I'll go see what type of help John needs. 
If there is nothing, I'll work on the reporting problem. 
Either way, I'll send you an email letting you know what I am working on."
B: "That would be perfect. 
Thanks."
A: "Thanks. 
I'll talk to you later."

Bye."

I would be happy with a cubicle. 
We have 10 desks all in a large room. 
The supervisor is at one end with a view of everyone."
A: "That sucks. 
You have no privacy."
B: "I know. 
I can't even take a small break because everyone is watching. 
But that's not the worst part. 
I can hear everyone talking all day long and it's so distracting."
A: "I feel sorry for you."
B: "I can't even complain about something to the supervisor because everyone can hear."

Maybe they want to save money, or maybe they think it's more effective."

There is so much privacy and we can take breaks whenever we want."
A: "How does management know if you are working or not?"
B: "Our company doesn't really keep track of little details. 
Our performance is based on our assignments and projects. 
Management doesn't care when it's done, they just want the person to do a good job and turn it in on time."
A: "I like that method. 
In our company, our manager wants to know every detail almost every hour. 
If we are a little behind, the manager gets mad and starts worrying."
B: "I would hate that environment."
A: "I agree. 
It's not a good work environment. 
Do you ever play video games in your office?"
B: "Not when it is busy, but when we are experiencing a down time, I close the door and start a game of Star Craft. 
If someone comes in, I quickly switch the view on the monitor."
A: "You're so lucky."

B: "Yeah. 
I always get nervous during this time."
A: "It shouldn't go too bad."
B: "So, how did I do this year?"
A: "Let me first ask you how you feel about your performance?"
B: "I think I improved a lot and made a lot of great contributions. 
I completed all my assignments ahead of schedule, I volunteered for two more extra projects, and mentored a couple of our newer employees."
A: "I agree. 
You did great this year. 
I got your rating back from upper management and it's not bad, but it's not the best. 
You received a 3.5, a 4 percent raise, and an 8 percent bonus."
B: "I got a 3.5? Why? I was really expecting a 4 this year. 
I really worked hard."
A: "Unfortunately, we can't give everyone a 4. There were a lot of people who did great this year and we only had a few 4's to give. 
You barely missed the cut."
B: "What could I have done to get a 4? I thought I did everything to deserve one."
A: "I agree. 
I think you should have received a four, but the only thing I can suggest is for you to be more visible. 
The people who beat you this year didn't necessarily do better work than you, it's just that people knew the work they were doing more than yours. 
You need to stand out a little better."
B: "How do I do that? It doesn't make sense. 
If I work my ass off and I do great work, why does it matter if I show off or not?"
A: "If 3 people are equal in their work, the only deciding factor is how much of the work they know about. 
Since upper management cannot know the details of everything, they mainly see the people who are visible. 
You can do this by taking on projects that affect the whole team so everyone can see, or you can be pro-active in finding places for improvements and sending out a mail to management with your ideas."
B: "If I did a great job, why did I only get a 4 percent raise?"
A: "You got a high raise comparing to other people. 
The average raise throughout the company was 2 percent. 
They cut back a lot on raises due to the slow economy."
B: "I'm a little disappointed, I'll see you tomorrow."
A: "Ok. 
Think about what I said and we'll try to give you more assignments with more visibility."

B: "I register this Friday."
A: "What classes do you plan on taking?"
B: "I really want to take the communication class, but I don't know if it will be available."
A: "Is that class really that popular?"
B: "Yeah. 
I tried to get in last semester, but it was full by the time I registered."
A: "What other classes are you going to take?"
B: "I still need to take English 201, but I really don't like writing."
A: "I took that class already. 
There is a lot of writing, but it's not that bad."
B: "Oh really? Who was the instructor? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from."
A: "I had Professor Mahoney."
B: "Is he an easy grader?"
A: "I'm not sure if he is or not, but I thought he was definitely fair."
B: "Do you mind if I ask you what you got?"
A: "Not at all. 
I got a 3.8."
B: "Well, what did you get in English 101 last year?"
A: "I got a 4.0 in that class."
B: "Well, I can't compare to you. 
I got a 3.1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, it must be harder."
A: "It's not what it appears. 
I actually tried harder in the 101 class. 
If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade."
B: "Oh. 
That helps. 
Thanks."

I forgot about registration. 
I'm a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. 
What do you think I should do?"
B: "You're screwed. 
You can't do anything about that. 
You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful."
A: "Do you think going to the registration building will help at all?"
B: "No. 
They will tell you the same thing in a worse way."
A: "Did you register yet?"
B: "Of course. 
Registering for classes is not something you want to miss."
A: "What classes do you think are still open?"
B: "Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. 
You can also get into Sociology."
A: "That's helpful. 
Thanks. 
But what do you think about philosophy? I wanted to take that class this semester."
B: "I took that class last year. 
The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full."
A: "He does that?"
B: "I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class."
A: "That makes sense. 
I think I'll do that. 
Thanks for all the help."
B: "No problem man."

A: "Ouch. 
You must be very disappointed."
B: "Well, it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have."
A: "Why don't you re-take the class next year?"
B: "That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. 
How did you do this semester?"
A: "I didn't do that well either. 
I ended up with a 3.2 this semester. 
That drops my total GPA to 3.45."
B: "My GPA is pretty similar to yours. 
I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class."
A: "What was your GPA before this semester?"
B: "I was sitting happy with a 3.4."
A: "Why did it go down so much?"
B: "Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class."
A: "What happened to you?"

I'm not going to play games during school anymore."

What do you think about him?"
B: "He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, but fortunately, he's an easy grader."
A: "What did you end up getting?"
B: "I got an A-. Sounds good, but none of my test scores were that high, so I don't know how I got a decent grade."
A: "That's probably because he grades on a curve."
B: "Are you enjoying the class so far?"
A: "I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. 
But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out."
B: "Yes. 
Definitely stay in the class. 
You will get a better grade than your test scores.

A: "I took summer school. 
I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up."
B: "So are you officially a junior now?"
A: "Yeah. 
And I have 5 credits to spare. 
I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same."
B: "That makes sense. 
So where is Nicole?"
A: "She dropped out of school completely."
B: "Really? Why?"
A: "She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time."
B: "Wow. 
She's so lucky. 
She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job."
A: "It sounds good now, but I'm traditional. 
I want the degree, so I wouldn't have accepted the offer."

It was hard. 
When do you take it?"
A: "I take it tomorrow morning. 
There is so much material, that I don't know what to emphasize on. 
What types of questions did you get?"
B: "Mostly on the civil war. 
You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr. 
had on American society."
A: "How about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?"
B: "I only had 1 question about him. 
But you might get more. 
I don't know if he will have the same exam or not."
A: "Hopefully he will use the same exam, cause I'm going to spend most of my time studying the civil war.

B: "No. 
We usually go to places that have specials. 
Dante's over on the Ave has $5.00 pitchers on Mondays. 
So for ten, fifteen bucks, I can get a lot of drinks."
A: "That's true."
B: "If you don't like beer, have you tried mixed drinks? Some of them are pretty good."
A: "I like beer, it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3."
B: "You just have to build up a tolerance. 
I used to be like that. 
But your body gets used to it."
A: "It'll take awhile, but I'm working on it."
B: "Hey let's go out tomorrow night. 
The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers."

You look great."

It's a little out of our budget so we didn't even consider Australia."
A: "For the price, Cancun is one of the best so don't have any regrets. 
It is a great place. 
So do you have a ride to the airport?"
B: "My brother is going to drop us off."
A: "Looks like everything is set. 
Just make sure to take a camera. 
I know many people who forgot to take a camera on their honeymoon."
B: "Will do. 
Thanks."

He comes home and complains about his hard day at work. 
He expects me to do everything. 
He even wants me to feed him sometimes. 
Can you believe that?"
A: "That sucks."

He mows the lawn, but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it?"
A: "That's crossing the line."

I'll have to live with it.

I started dating this cute guy and decided to start exercising."
A: "You're not out of shape. 
You look fine."
B: "Well, this guy I am seeing is a personal trainer and he has a perfect body.

He complains about stomach pains a lot these days."

Any idea what could have caused it?"
A: "He says it is because he didn't take care of himself when he was young. 
That's why I want to start thinking about my health."
B: "I think it is important to take care of yourself while you are young too. 
Even though my reasons are not the best, at least I am working on it."

I'm thankful that they are healthy."

B: "Yeah, but I want to show her how much she means to me, and this is one way of proving it. 
I'm changing for the better."

Hey, when do you plan on proposing to her?"

Who was that girl I saw you with last Friday night?"

That was Jessica. 
She's a girl I met the other week."

B: "No. 
We broke up a couple weeks ago."
A: "Are you getting pretty serious with this new girl?"
B: "She's not long term. 
Just someone to chill with."
A: "Ah... so you are boning her."
B: "Damn right. 
But we don't have much in common. 
Oh well. 
At least we are compatible in bed."
A: "She had a nice figure. 
You sure it's not going to work out?"
B: "It works out well in bed, but if you try to have a conversation with her, it just dies out fast."
A: "At least she is good for one thing. 
Ha ha ha."
B: "How about you? You've been seeing Heidi for a long time now. 
When are you going to tie the knot?"
A: "I don't know. 
She's been bugging me about marriage, but I don't see the need to rush it."
B: "You guys have been seeing each other for like 3 years haven't you?"
A: "Actually, it's been more than 4 years already."
B: "Wow. 
That's a long time. 
Any problems with having a girlfriend for that long?"
A: "Not really. 
It gets a little boring at times, but we grew to be great friends. 
I can totally be myself around her."
B: "I think that is the best type of relationships. 
Good for you."
A: "Well, if you put it that way."
B: "I would love to be in your situation. 
You have a beautiful girl that you are in love with, and you are perfect for each other. 
What else do you want?"
A: "Maybe a little more excitement."
B: "So would you give up your girlfriend for what I have? A little excitement here and there? You can't have both you know. 
Unless you're a cheating dog."
A: "I don't think I can go behind her back. 
We have a trusting relationship I don't want to risk."

You make me feel better."

That's what friends are for right?"

I thought it was an ordinary Valentines day present, but when I opened it, it was this big diamond ring. 
Right then, he got on his knees and proposed."
B: "That's so cool. 
So you really got surprised?"
A: "We talked about marriage a little, but I never knew he was serious."
B: "You are going to be busy with wedding plans. 
But you have several months to prepare for it."

So I'm going to need some help.

How many bridesmaids are you going to have?"

Susan, Tina, and Cindy."

Did you play when you were a kid?"
B: "Yeah. 
I played until I graduated from high school."
A: "What position did you play?"
B: "I think I tried every position, but the last few years, I played third."
A: "I hate third base. 
It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast."
B: "It was scary at first, but after a while, I got used to it. 
If you have fast reflexes, then it's not really a problem. 
What position did you play?"
A: "I played outfield. 
I hated the infield because I never figured out the bounces."
B: "I wish I could play again, but there isn't much opportunities around here."
A: "I'm on a softball league. 
It's not fast pitch, but it's still fun.

Did you hear that A-Rod went to the Yankees?"

The richest team is usually the best team. 
They need to put a salary cap to make things fair."

B: "But don't lose hope too soon. 
The Yankees don't have a good pitching staff this year. 
They might end up like the Texas Rangers. 
Great offense, no pitching."
A: "I highly doubt that. 
Even though they lost Pettite, they still have a decent pitching rotation."
B: "We'll see. 
I hope the Mariners do well this year."
A: "Me too. 
Oh, did you buy any tickets this year?"
B: "I got a couple of games with Oakland and Boston, but I couldn't get anything with the Yankees."

Do you play/like basketball much?"

I'd rather play than watch."
A: "I like to watch as much as I like to play. 
Do you play often?"
B: "Every now and then with some friends."

It's easy to round up 10 guys during the evening time."

I was too small to play for college."
A: "What position did you play?"
B: "I was the corner back."

B: "No. 
That's the quarterback.

But overall, I shot well, so I'm not too disappointed.

I had a pair of Kings and went all in. 
Albert had an Ace Queen and called me. 
When the cards came out, he ended up with a pair of aces and I lost."
A: "I hate when that happens. 
So did Albert end up winning?"
B: "No. 
He lost to Jerry. 
Anyway on the last game, it was me and Andrew. 
I had Ace King suited. 
On the flop, it was Ace, King, and Queen. 
Andrew went all in and I called. 
The next card was a King and I had a full house. 
It was nearly impossible for me to lose. 
Except another Queen came out and he had four of a kind. 
Can you believe that? I had a full house and I lost."
A: "That sucks. 
He's so lucky. 
I can't believe he got four of a kind."
B: "That's poker I guess."
A: "I hear they are going to play again this Saturday? Are you going to play?"
B: "Hell yeah. 
Do you know what time they're playing?"
A: "I think they want to start a little earlier because it takes a long time to play. 
Probably around 7:00."
B: "I get off at 6:30 so it's going to be tight. 
I'll come as soon as possible."
A: "Alright. 
See you later."

B: "Yeah. 
His name is John. 
I started dating him a week ago."
A: "That's so exciting. 
Tell me all about him. 
Is he good looking?"
B: "I think he's cute, but not drop dead gorgeous."
A: "How did you meet him?"
B: "I go to this coffee shop a lot and this guy is always there. 
We started talking a couple of times, and he finally asked me out."
A: "That's so cool. 
What does he do for a living?"
B: "He works in the finance department in a manufacturing company."
A: "Do you know if he makes a lot of money?"
B: "I don't know for sure, but he drives a nice car and I heard he has a house."
A: "How is his personality?"
B: "He's very smart and a great person to talk to. 
In the beginning, we talked for about 30 minutes a day in the coffee shop before he asked me out. 
Besides that, he's very sweet and romantic."
A: "How old is he?"
B: "That's the problem. 
He is 2 years younger than me. 
What do you think about that?"
A: "What's the big deal? I don't see anything wrong with that. 
If you were 23, then I might be worried he was immature, but you're almost 30 now. 
2 years is no big deal."
B: "Yeah. 
That's what I think."
A: "When do I get to meet him?"
B: "How about a double date? The four of us can go out to dinner and a drink or something."
A: "That sounds great. 
How about next Saturday?"

Let's double check with the guys and get back to each other."

A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there."

A: "Hey Mike. 
I forgot about registration. 
I'm a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. 
What do you think I should do?"
B: "You're screwed. 
You can't do anything about that. 
You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful."
A: "Do you think going to the registration building will help at all."
B: "No. 
They will tell you the same thing in a worse way."
A: "Did you register yet?"
B: "Of course. 
Registering for classes is not something you want to miss."
A: "What classes do you think are still open?"
B: "Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. 
You can also get into Sociology."
A: "That's helpful. 
Thanks. 
But what do you think about philosophy. 
I wanted to take that class this semester."
B: "I took that class last year. 
The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full."
A: "He does that?"
B: "I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class."
A: "That makes sense. 
I think I'll do that. 
Thanks for all the help."
B: "No problem man."

Instead of eating 3 times a day, she told me to eat 5 times a day."
A: "That doesn't make sense. 
If you eat more, than how do you lose weight?"
B: "Actually, I'm eating the same amount. 
I eat 5 smaller meals a day. 
Basically, it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate."
A: "That makes sense. 
I'm going to try that."
B: "You don't need to lose weight."
A: "I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of."
B: "Ah... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet."
A: "Thanks for the advice."
B: "No problem."

But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight."

All my friends smoke, and we hang out a lot."

A: "When I started I didn't, but after a few months I started smoking at home. 
Usually when I'm bored."
B: "Do you smoke cause you're bored?"
A: "Yeah. 
It helps to kill the time.

I'm so used to having a cigarette every now and then."

B: "Well, I think you should quit. 
You know it's bad for you?"
A: "I always knew it was bad, but I never thought about it."
B: "You better start thinking about it now. 
You might not feel the difference now, but after 10 years of smoking, you might feel it and then it will be too late."
A: "That's a good point. 
I'll try to quit."
B: "Good. 
And if you need any support, I'll always be here for you."

I've been on a diet for about 6 months. 
I'm going to ask Rachel to marry me soon and I want to be mentally and physically healthy."

I am changing for the better."

It's not too expensive and I like all the equipment they have."

Are they having any specials right now?"

They have free enrollment and first month free.

I thought you were going to break single."
B: "I had a chance. 
I shot a 4 on the front nine, but the back nine killed me."

You could have broken single if it wasn't for the penalty strokes."

A: "Hey Cindy. 
I heard you are seeing someone."
B: "Yeah. 
His name is John. 
I started dating him a week ago."
A: "That's so exciting. 
Tell me all about him. 
Is he good looking?"
B: "I think he's cute, but not drop dead gorgeous."
A: "How did you meet him?"
B: "I go to this coffee shop a lot and this guy is always there. 
We started talking a couple of times, and he finally asked me out."
A: "That's so cool. 
What does he do for a living?"
B: "He works in the finance department in a manufacturing company."
A: "Do you know if he makes a lot of money?"
B: "I don't know for sure, but he drives a nice car and I heard he has a house."
A: "How is his personality?"
B: "He's very smart and a great person to talk to. 
In the beginning, we talked for about 30 minutes a day in the coffee shop before he asked me out. 
Besides that, he's very sweet and romantic."
A: "How old is he?"
B: "That's the problem. 
He is 2 years younger than me. 
What do you think about that?"
A: "What's the big deal? I don't see anything wrong with that. 
If you were 23, then I might be worried he was immature, but you're almost 30 now. 
2 years is no big deal."
B: "Yeah. 
That's what I think."
A: "When do I get to meet him?"
B: "How about a double date. 
The four of us can go out to dinner and a drink or something."
A: "That sounds great. 
How about next Saturday?"

Let's double check with the guys and get back to each other."
A: "Great. 
I'll call you later then."

Using the word 'at' helps tell someone where you currently are. 
The difference between 'at' and 'in' is that the physical location is general.

Here are some examples:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/E02/sentence/E002S6.mp3">I'm at the grocery.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/E02/sentence/E002S7.mp3">I'm at the mall.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/E02/sentence/E002S10.mp3">I'm at the airport.</a>"

However, in some cases you can use 'at' and 'in' interchangeably.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/E02/sentence/E002S16.mp3">I'm in the grocery.</a>"

Using the word 'on' is referring to a non physical location such as your time being utilized by something else.

Here are some examples:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/E02/sentence/E002S17.mp3">I'm on the phone.</a>"

'I am trying' informs someone that you are attempting to accomplish something using bodily, mental, or spiritual strength. 
By adding a verb to 'I'm trying' you are pointing out exactly what it is you are attempting to do.

<h2>I wanna + (verb)</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/2013-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

The word 'wanna' is incorrect grammatically. 
It is equivalent to 'want to.' When combined with the word 'I' it helps communicate something you want to do.

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/2014-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

<h2>I was about to + (verb)</h2>

<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/audiolongTE/2018-long.mp3">Listen to the Entire Lesson</a>

When stating 'I was about to' you are informing someone that you were going to do something, but another event prevented you from doing it. 
It is similar to 'I am about to' but the difference is that you will not do it any longer. 
Since you will not do it any longer, it becomes a past event. 
That is why we use 'was' instead of 'am'

Here is an example conversionsation to help you understand.

A: Hi Mike. 
I need to ask you a favor.
B: Hey Bob. 
What do you need?
A: Can you drive me to the convenient store? My car is in the shop and we really need to get milk.
B: Sure. 
I can do that.
A: Were you in the middle of something? I don't want to bother you.
B: I was about to watch a movie, but that can wait.

In this case, he cannot say, "I am about to watch a movie" because he will not be watching it because he has to drive his friend. 
You use "I was about to" when you will not be doing something immediately because of some other event.

Here are some examples:

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/E18/sentence/E018S1.mp3">I was about to go out.</a>"

To ring a bell became a way of saying that you remember something. 
Another explanation comes from Pavlov.

<h2>Has Been Burned</h2>

<b>Meaning/Usage</b>: To get screwed; to get a bad deal; to be tricked

<b>Explanation</b>: When you are burned, it hurts. 
When you are screwed, get a bad deal, or get cheated, that hurts too. 
So it became common to use "burned" in this manner.

<h2>Keep Me in the Loop</h2>

<b>Meaning/Usage</b>: To be informed about everything regarding that subject

<b>Explanation</b>: "Loop" is a cycle or a continual circular motion. 
When you are not in the circle, then you don't know what is going on. 
So being in the loop is indicating that you are aware of the situation. 
Being kept in the loop is asking someone to keep you informed about what is happening.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P146/sentence/P146S1.mp3">I really want to know what happens so <b>keep me in the loop</b>.</a>"

<h2>I'll Be Down</h2>

<b>Meaning/Usage</b>: To agree to participate in the plan

<b>Explanation</b>: "Down" comes from "down to earth." When you are down to earth, you are realistic and not imagining things. 
Therefore, when you are "down," you are basically legitimate or a real. 
This is an informal way of saying you are in for the plan.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P147/sentence/P147S1.mp3">If you don't want to go to the pool, <b>I'll be down</b> for whatever.</a>"

<b>Meaning/Usage</b>: Used when someone is not providing the piece of information that is the most important.

<b>Explanation</b>: When someone is telling you something and they are going around in circles without coming to any conclusion or without providing the main point, you can use this by itself to tell someone to stop going around in circles and to tell you what they mean.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P148/sentence/P148S1.mp3">Can you please <b>get to the point</b>? You're taking forever.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/P148/sentence/P148S2.mp3"><b>Get to the point</b>, you're making no sense.</a>"

There is no right or wrong answer for this question. 
Most important thing you should remember is how you deliver the message. 
The example above shows a short answer telling a little bit about the person. 
The answer went from education to career, and then to personal interests all in a smooth flow.

<h2>What are your strengths?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I2/sentence/I2S1.mp3">What are your strengths?</a>"</b>

This is a popular interview question. 
They want to know what you think of yourself. 
Although this is a general question, there is a wrong and right answer. 
The wrong answer is a generic answer saying you are organized and friendly. 
Although it will not hurt you during the interview, it will certainly not help you either. 
Answer this question based on the type of job you are applying for.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I2/sentence/I2S2.mp3">I believe my strongest trait is my attention to detail. 
This trait has helped me tremendously in this field of work.</a>"

<b>Long Answers</b>

Let's say I am interviewing for a management position. 
You should mention traits that are important for managers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I2/sentence/I2S6.mp3">A couple strengths I have are planning and execution, and working with people. 
I've always been very good at planning and detailing all the steps. 
Even in college, I would spend time organizing my week and planning a strategy to tackle each class or assignment. 
Executing a plan has always come easy for me as well. 
I believe it's due to proper planning. 
I also work with people very well in a way where I use the strengths of each individual in a team to produce the best results. 
Because of my easy going personality, I've been told by my directs that it's easy to approach me.</a>"

If you are applying for an accounting position, you should mention strong traits an accountant should have and claim them to be yours.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I2/sentence/I2S7.mp3">I'm very detail oriented, good at managing time, and very honest. 
I always incorporate managing time and being detailed together. 
By nature I've been detail oriented, and that resulted in taking too much time on a particular task. 
After incorporating time management into the mix, I found that my work and efficiency increased dramatically. 
I plan better and produce higher quality work in a time constraint environment. 
Finally, I'm a very honest person. 
When I was working as a valet attendant during college, a lady gave me a twenty dollar bill to pay for the three dollar fee. 
She almost drove off the lot, but I stopped her and said here is your change. 
My co-workers said I should have considered the change as tip, but I know what I did was honest and right. 
You can fool other people, but you can't fool yourself. 
That's what I believe.</a>" 

The second example can seem a little wordy. 
But the power of an example is greater than any great words you can string together. 
Everyone can claim they are honest, but with an example, it is much more believable.

<h2>What are your weaknesses?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S1.mp3">What are your weaknesses?</a>"</b>

For this answer, you should display a weakness that can be seen as a strength. 
There are many types of answers that will work. 
Some answers will be good answers for certain jobs, while the same answer will be a bad answer for a different job. 
Select an answer that will work for the position you are applying for. 
Here are a few examples.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S2.mp3">This might be bad, but in college I found that I procrastinated a lot. 
I realized this problem, and I'm working on it by finishing my work ahead of schedule.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S3.mp3">I feel my weakness is not being detail oriented enough. 
I'm a person that wants to accomplish as much as possible. 
I realized this hurts the quality and I'm currently working on finding a balance between quantity and quality.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S4.mp3">I feel my English ability is my weakest trait. 
I know this is only a temporary problem. 
I'm definitely studying hard to communicate more effectively.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S5.mp3">The weakest trait I struggled with was not asking for help. 
I always try to solve my own problems instead of asking a co-worker who might know the answer. 
This would save me more time and I would be more efficient. 
I'm working on knowing when it would be beneficial to ask for help.</a>"

<b>Long Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S6.mp3">I think my weakest trait is my impatience. 
Whenever I work in a team and a member is not performing up to my expectations, I can get impatient and annoyed. 
I understand if they are working hard and their portion is difficult, but sometimes a person can't do the assignment due to incompetence or laziness. 
A while back I would get frustrated and start complaining, but I realized that I can help out by explaining things to some people and encouraging lazy people by reminding them of deadlines. 
I know it's bad to be impatient, but I'm definitely working on it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I3/sentence/I3S7.mp3">I'm too detail oriented. 
I never want to leave anything out and I want everything to be perfect. 
This is bad because it slows down my work. 
Initially, I tried to work faster to compensate, but that only made me sloppy. 
So I decided to put more emphasis on priority and planning. 
By doing so, I'm hoping that I can make the proper decisions on what to work on and what to intentionally leave out.</a>"

Both of these examples show an answer that is acceptable. 
Although being impatient is not good, it shows that you are a quick learner and that you like efficiency. 
The second displays a person that is detail oriented, which can be seen as a good trait. 
Finally, both answers identify the weakness and show the actions of correcting it.

<h2>What are your short term goals?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S1.mp3">What are your short term goals?</a>"</b>

This question primarily depends on where you are in your career. 
A person with 5 years of experience will have different short term goals than a person with no work experience. 
I'll give an example for both scenarios. 
But first, here are some short answers.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S2.mp3">My short term goal is to find a position where I can use the knowledge and strengths that I have. 
I want to partake in the growth and success of the company I work for.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S3.mp3">I've learned the basics of marketing during my first two years. 
I want to take the next step by taking on challenging projects. 
My short term goal is to grow as a marketing analyst.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S4.mp3">As a program manager, it's important to understand all areas of the project. 
Although I have the technical abilities to be successful in my job, I want to learn different software applications that might help in work efficiency.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S5.mp3">My goal is to always perform at an exceptional level. 
But a short term goal I have set for myself is to implement a process that increases work efficiency.</a>"

<b>Long Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S6.mp3">My short term goal is to learn everything I can about marketing. 
I want to find a position where I can contribute what I've learned through education and to gain real life experience. 
I believe the next couple of years will be very important to me and my immediate goal is to learn and become skilled in all aspects of marketing.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I4/sentence/I4S7.mp3">My short term goal is to get into a management position. 
The last five years of my career, I've concentrated on learning and acquiring all the skills needed to perform excellent work. 
Recently, I've taken more responsibilities in management because I eventually want to become a sales manager. 
I'm excited about the last few assignments I completed because it involved working with vendors and partners while managing a small group of workers. 
So I hope to be in a management position within a year or two and I feel I'm doing a diligent job by volunteering for extra work to gain more experience.</a>"

The first example is a person straight out of school. 
Learning is a good short term goal to have because it shows that you will be trying hard in your job. 
The second example is more detailed because that person has several years of experience. 
Anybody can say they want a management position, but this candidate is taking it a step further by showing the steps he is taking to achieve the short term goal. 
Thus, it becomes a stronger answer.

<h2>What are your long term goals?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I5/sentence/I5S1.mp3">What are your long term goals?</a>"</b>

This question is asked to see how serious a candidate is about his or her career. 
Some people might not know their long term goals, and some people might have long term goals of becoming rich and retiring early. 
Those are incorrect answers for this question. 
The type of answer you want to give is an ambitious answer that shows you really love your career. 
A good interviewer will read between the lines and find out if a person is going to be a hard worker or just a mediocre one. 
Being descriptive and shooting for a big goal is something interviewers want to hear.

<b>Short Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I5/sentence/I5S2.mp3">I would like to become a director or higher. 
This might be a little ambitious, but I know I'm smart, and I'm willing to work hard.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I5/sentence/I5S3.mp3">After a successful career, I would love to write a book on office efficiency. 
I think working smart is important and I have many ideas. 
So after gaining more experience, I'm going to try to write a book.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I5/sentence/I5S4.mp3">I've always loved to teach. 
I like to grow newer employees and help co-workers where ever I can. 
So in the future, I would love to be an instructor.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I5/sentence/I5S5.mp3">I want to become a valued employee of a company. 
I want to make a difference and I'm willing to work hard to achieve this goal. 
I don't want a regular career, I want a special career that I can be proud of.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I5/sentence/I5S6.mp3">My long term goal is to become a partner for a consulting firm. 
I know the hard work involved in achieving this goal, and I know that many people fail to become a partner. 
That's not going to stop me from working hard, learning everything I can, and contributing to a company where I'll become a valuable asset. 
I know it's not a guarantee, but becoming a partner is a long term goal of mine, and I am going to work towards this goal throughout my career.</a>"

This example shows a candidate with a big goal. 
This person identifies the difficulty of the goal and shows the steps required to achieve this goal. 
Despite the difficulty, this candidate shows he or she will not get discouraged with difficult situations and will never give up. 
It is a short answer that goes a long way.

<h2>What do you want to be doing five years from now?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S1.mp3">What do you want to be doing five years from now?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S2.mp3">Where do you see yourself in five years?</a>"</b>

This is a similar question to the short term question, but you should answer it a little differently. 
Here are some examples.

<b>Short Answers</b>
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S3.mp3">In five years, I see myself as a valued employee of a company. 
I want to be an expert at my position and start training to be a manager.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S4.mp3">In five years, I want to be a senior analyst. 
I want my expertise to directly impact the company in a positive way.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S5.mp3">My goal is to become a lead in five years. 
Although not everyone gets promoted to this level, I believe I can achieve this goal through hard work.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S6.mp3">Although I really enjoy working hands on as a mechanical engineer, I want to eventually become a manager. 
I want to continue gaining experience, and after learning many different aspects, I see myself in management.</a>"

<b>Long Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S7.mp3">Five years from now, I would like to see myself in a management position. 
I'm going to be learning and gaining practical experience until then, but eventually, I want to become a marketing manager. 
I know there are a lot of things to learn, but I'm going to be working hard for the next five years. 
I believe opportunities come to great workers and I'm going to try to be one of them.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I6/sentence/I6S8.mp3">Five years from now, I want to be a senior sales manager. 
I'm currently training to become a manager, and if I continue to work hard, I feel I'll have a management position soon. 
After gaining several years of experience as a sales manager, I want to be in a position where I can train and provide my expertise to newer sales managers.</a>"

Both answers display characteristics of working hard. 
The second example also mentions that he or she wants to train newer managers. 
This is a good answer because it targets one good trait about upper management... the ability to train managers.

<h2>If you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be and why?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I7/sentence/I7S1.mp3">If you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be and why?</a>"</b>

This question is another variation to the weakness question. 
You can provide a similar type of question unless it is the same person asking them. 
To answer this question, think of a person you respect and the trait they have that you really like. 
I used to have a manager that was very patient and explained things very carefully. 
I really liked this trait, so I'm going to provide the long answer by using this example. 
But first, let's look at some short answers.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I7/sentence/I7S2.mp3">I get easily frustrated at people who don't work very hard. 
But I know people have different work styles and different work habits. 
So if I could change something, I would like to be more understanding.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I7/sentence/I7S3.mp3">I have high expectations and I have these expectations on others. 
I think if I was more understanding, I could help other workers improve instead of being disappointed.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I7/sentence/I7S4.mp3">I would like to be more of a risk taker. 
I always do my work and complete it at an exceptional level, but sometimes taking a risk can make the work even better. 
I'm working on this by thinking the issue through and weighing the pros and cons.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I7/sentence/I7S5.mp3">I would like to be more of an extrovert. 
I'm a little quiet and a little closer to the introvert side. 
I would like to change this because I would appear more friendly.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I7/sentence/I7S6.mp3">I wish I was more patient with people. 
I remember a manager I had a couple of years ago. 
He was very patient with everyone. 
Even workers that were not that smart and failed to understand a concept to perform the job. 
I remember thinking how can this person who can't understand this concept continue to work here. 
My manager took a different approach. 
He was understanding of this worker and explained the concept in a different way. 
He even explained how to view problems from a different perspective. 
That helped this worker and in time that worker became a strong contributor. 
So if I could change one thing about me, I would like to be more patient and understanding. 
I'm taking the steps to change for the better by remembering the actions of my past manager whenever I'm in a similar situation.</a>"

This is a little long, but if you can speak smoothly, it shows off your communication skills. 
Also, the content of the answer is not that bad. 
They want a personality problem, and this answer is showing impatience while indicating that you understand difficult concepts easily. 
It also shows that you are working on correcting the bad behavior.

<h2>What does success mean to you?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I8/sentence/I8S1.mp3">What does success mean to you?</a>"</b>

There are many things you can say. 
This type of question doesn't have a wrong answer. 
All answers will be correct. 
So the best answer is how good you can make the answer. 
A mediocre answer will be something like completing a project on time. 
You can say this, but add another twist to make the answer a little better. 
Here is an example.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I8/sentence/I8S2.mp3">To me, success means to have a goal, plan the steps to achieve the goal, implement the plan, and finally achieve the goal.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I8/sentence/I8S3.mp3">Success means to achieve a goal I have set for myself.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I8/sentence/I8S4.mp3">Success means to produce high quality work before the deadline.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I8/sentence/I8S5.mp3">Success to me is knowing that my contributions positively impacted my company.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I8/sentence/I8S6.mp3">Success to me means completing a task and when looking back, thinking I couldn't have done it better. 
To succeed is to complete a task or assignment on time in an excellent manner. 
But that's only half of it. 
The results should be good and the people involved should gain a valuable lesson or experience. 
For example, if it was a group project, and only two people out of four really did the work, I wouldn't call that success. 
If everyone participated and worked together providing a valuable deliverable then it's a success. 
So I think both the result and the process should be great to call something a success.</a>"

This answer is showing that you believe in delivering great quality work. 
Moreover, it is implying how much you value team work. 
If you value teamwork highly, then it is safe to assume that you would make a great team player.

<h2>What does failure mean to you?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I9/sentence/I9S1.mp3">What does failure mean to you?</a>"</b>

This is quite simple. 
I don't see many right answers so this is what I suggest. 
You can believe in two of the following. 
One, you believe that failure is not achieving your goal no matter what. 
Or two, you can believe failure is only when nothing is learned from the failure. 
I believe in the latter, but you don't have to agree with me.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I9/sentence/I9S2.mp3">Failure is when I do not reach my goal.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I9/sentence/I9S3.mp3">I think to fail at something is making a mistake and not learning anything from it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I9/sentence/I9S4.mp3">To me, failure means to have a goal and not do anything about it.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I9/sentence/I9S5.mp3">I think failure is not reaching your potential. 
If you do not use the resources you have and the resources around you, that's failure because the work or goal could have been done better.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I9/sentence/I9S6.mp3">I think it's harder to fail than it is to succeed. 
The reason is, if you fail in a project, you can learn a valuable lesson from your mistake. 
Learning from the mistake will allow you to improve future projects, or to simply not repeat them. 
Just because I believe this, doesn't mean I believe it's acceptable to fail at a project, but just in case, I would try to learn everything I can... even when the end result wasn't that good. 
So, failure to me means making a mistake and having learned nothing from it.</a>"

Nobody wants a failure. 
So you can feel that answering like this will be risky. 
However, this is a solid answer that most people agree with. 
If the person doesn't like this answer, then you might not want to work for this person. 
Everyone fails and if you work for someone who doesn't tolerate failure, then you will be in a difficult situation. 
Even vice presidents of large corporations will believe that learning from mistakes is a valuable lesson. 
This answer also states that you will do you best not to fail, but just in case, you want to gain something from your experience.

<h2>Are you an organized person?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I10/sentence/I10S1.mp3">Are you an organized person?</a>"</b>

You can think that this question is stupid. 
Actually, I do. 
Everyone will say they are organized. 
Who will admit otherwise? You should know that everyone will say similar things. 
Take this time to be creative with your answer. 
You can use these types of questions to leave a strong impression with a creative answer. 
Or, if you are not creative, then the best way to answer this question is with an example. 
Using a story is more believable and easier to remember. 
Feel free to mix in a little humor to make it more memorable.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I10/sentence/I10S2.mp3">I'm a very organized person. 
I like to know exactly what I'm going to do for the day and the week. 
So I outline my tasks and organize my work load. 
By doing so, I can organize my time and work better.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I10/sentence/I10S3.mp3">I believe I'm very organized. 
I like to organize my work by priority and deadlines. 
I do this so I can produce the highest quality work in the amount of time I have.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I10/sentence/I10S4.mp3">I think I'm quite organized. 
I like my documents and papers in a way where I can retrieve them quickly. 
I also organize my work in a way where it's easy to see exactly what I'm doing.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I10/sentence/I10S5.mp3">Organization has always come easy to me. 
I naturally organize things like my desk, time, assignments, and work without thinking about them. 
This helps me tremendously during times when I'm approaching a deadline.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I10/sentence/I10S6.mp3">I'm actually a very organized person. 
It's funny that you mention this because just the other day, my roommate wanted to borrow my suitcase and saw my closet. 
He made fun of me for organizing my clothes by length and color. 
I'm like that with everything. 
It's just so much easier to manage things. 
However, I'm not picky and don't need to have things in a certain way. 
I just want things to be organized. 
So yes, I consider myself organized.</a>"

This example should only be done if you are confident with your communication abilities. 
If you appear awkward or if you sound like you are reading this type of answer, it could have a negative effect. 
Instead, you should make a generic answer if you are uncomfortable with this type of answer.

<h2>In what ways are you organized and disorganized?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I11/sentence/I11S1.mp3">In what ways are you organized and disorganized?</a>"</b>

This is another variation to the previous question. 
This question is a little better because the question wants you to identify an area you are disorganized. 
Make sure to emphasize the organized portion of the answer. 
If you are truly an organized person, then it is really tough thinking about an area you are disorganized. 
So thinking ahead of time will allow you to make a good impression with a solid answer.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I11/sentence/I11S2.mp3">I'm very organized with my time and work, but my desk is a little disorganized.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I11/sentence/I11S3.mp3">Since I work with many files, I like to keep my desk organized. 
I always have everything in a certain place so I can find things easier. 
The area I'm disorganized is probably my computer desktop. 
I usually have so many icons everywhere. 
I should organize it a little, but I've never needed to.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I11/sentence/I11S4.mp3">I organize my schedule the best. 
I'm used to many meetings so it's important for me to be organized with my schedule and time. 
The area I need to improve is probably my file cabinet. 
I started to sort things alphabetically, but when I'm busy, I start putting things in there. 
It started getting hard to find things, but this is something I'm going to fix.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I11/sentence/I11S5.mp3">Oh... that's a good question. 
Well, I'm organized in almost everything I do. 
I'm very organized with my schedule and time. 
I like to work efficiently, and being organized with my time helps me. 
The area I feel I'm disorganized is probably my desk. 
I like to work fast and don't keep my desk area as tidy as some people I know. 
This however doesn't prevent me from doing my job well. 
You know some people can have files and paper all over their desk but some how know exactly where everything is located. 
I think I'm one of those people. 
However, if I know I'm having a client or a guest, then I would definitely make things more tidy.</a>"

This answer brings a little humor to the question. 
It lightens the mood and makes a person seem real instead of appearing to be perfect. 
However, if the job you are applying for requires constant customer interaction, then this answer will not be good. 
This answer would be better for an office job where not many people will see your desk.

<h2>Do you manage your time well?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I12/sentence/I12S1.mp3">Do you manage your time well?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I12/sentence/I12S2.mp3">In what ways do you manage your time well?</a>"</b>

The first question is a little easier. 
The second question is more difficult because it requires an example. 
I'm going to give an example for the second question and you should be able to use it for the first question as well.

<b>Short Answer</b>
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I12/sentence/I12S3.mp3">I know I manage my time well because I'm never late to work, and I've never missed a deadline.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I12/sentence/I12S4.mp3">I'm good at managing my time. 
I stay busy both at home and at work and being able to manage my time is necessary for me to do everything that I want to do.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I12/sentence/I12S5.mp3">I manage my time well by planning out what I have to do for the whole week.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I12/sentence/I12S6.mp3">Managing my time is one of my strong traits. 
I prioritize my tasks and this allows me to stay ahead of schedule.

<h2>How do you handle change?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I13/sentence/I13S1.mp3">How do you handle change?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I13/sentence/I13S2.mp3">Are you good at dealing with change?</a>"</b>

Dealing with change is common in the work place. 
A simple yes will not be sufficient to impress the interviewer. 
This is another type of question where everyone will have similar answers. 
Of course everyone is going to claim being excellent dealing with change. 
You got to communicate that you are really good at dealing with change. 
Here are some examples for you.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I13/sentence/I13S3.mp3">I'm good at dealing with change because I'm a quick thinker. 
If new information makes us change our marketing strategy for example, I'll be quick to analyze the information and create a plan to make the changes.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I13/sentence/I13S4.mp3">I've experienced many changes previously.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I13/sentence/I13S6.mp3">I handle changes smoothly. 
Whenever there's a change of any sort, I analyze the situation and I always try to find ways I can contribute to the change in a positive way.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I13/sentence/I13S7.mp3">I believe dealing with change is a requirement in the workplace. 
The mission statement can change to introduce a new market segment, or the company might need to change direction. 
Whatever it is, as a member of this team, I would be expected to do my share by absorbing the new information, analyzing it thoroughly, sharing my ideas, and really being a valued team member. 
Dealing with change is a necessary trait. 
I think I'm also good at anticipating change by being attentive and observant.</a>"

Overall, this is a good answer. 
The last statement is a bold statement of being able to anticipate change. 
If the interviewer is impressed, they might follow up by asking for an example of how you anticipate change. 
If you use an answer like I provided, make sure you have an example. 
If you don't have one, then the answer you gave will be seen as a lie and you probably failed.

<h2>How do you make important decisions?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I14/sentence/I14S1.mp3">How do you make important decisions?</a>"</b>

There are many ways to answer this question, and if you have a reasonable method of making decisions, it will probably be sufficient. 
One answer I thought of included not being afraid of asking your manager. 
You can follow up by saying even the best needs mentoring, and you always want to improve. 
So basically, this could work as an answer, but depending on the job, you might have a better shot with an answer like my example.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I14/sentence/I14S2.mp3">I make important decisions by examining all the details and then weighing the pro's and con's for each decision.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I14/sentence/I14S4.mp3">I believe all decisions should be made by having all the information. 
If you are missing an important detail, it's easy to make a bad decision.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I14/sentence/I14S5.mp3">Important decisions are made by knowledge through information and wisdom through experience. 
I'll gather all the information I can find and then apply my experience while analyzing the information. 
With this combination, I'm confident I'll make the correct important decisions.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I14/sentence/I14S6.mp3">I think all decisions are important, and having as much information about the decision is one of the most important aspects. 
After examining all the facts, I would think about the outcome and consequences of each action and after weighing the pro's and con's, I would come to the best decision possible. 
However, I'm aware that some decisions are not as black and white. 
In this situation, I would rely on my experience, or even work with my team members to come up with the best decision.</a>"

This is a decent answer, but I think you might be able to think of a better one. 
Feel free to be creative with your answers because those are the answers the interviewer will remember the most.

<h2>Do you work well under pressure?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I15/sentence/I15S1.mp3">Do you work well under pressure?</a>"</b>

In most cases, the best answer to this question is answering yes. 
Working well under pressure is a good trait to have. 
However, I think if you answer that you work the same with pressure and without pressure, the interviewer will be more impressed. 
However, you will need to explain in words why this is better. 
Here are some of my answers.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I15/sentence/I15S2.mp3">I work well under pressure because I use the pressure to help me work more efficiently.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I15/sentence/I15S3.mp3">I enjoy working under pressure because I believe it helps me grow. 
In my previous experience, I always worked well during deadlines, and I always learned how to work more efficiently afterwards.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I15/sentence/I15S4.mp3">I work well under pressure because I don't panic. 
I maintain self control and work as efficiently as possible. 
In all my experiences, I did well and I always enjoyed the experience.</a>"

<b>Long Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I15/sentence/I15S6.mp3">To tell you the truth, I think I work the same if there's pressure or if there's no pressure. 
I try and take out negative emotional factors and work hard regardless of down time or busy time. 
I always prioritize and organize my work, and from there, work efficiently. 
If the situation involved pressure due to a lack of time, then the only difference in my work would be the extra time I would need to put in to meet the deadline on time. 
Since I believe my normal work is great work, then I suppose I work well under pressure.</a>"

I like this answer because it is different than the standard answer. 
If you are not comfortable with this answer, then you can use the next one.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I15/sentence/I15S7.mp3">I have a couple of friends who hate working under pressure. 
I don't know if it's odd, but I really enjoy working under pressure. 
I use the feelings of pressure as a tool to motivate me to work harder and more efficiently. 
In my last job, I remember we had a project to complete in 4 days where it usually took 10 days. 
There was a lot of panic by some team members, but I ensured everyone that if we concentrate on the task and work real hard, we can complete the project. 
It took a lot of overtime, and the last day we were in the office until two AM, but we managed to finish. 
It was hard work, but I really enjoyed that experience.</a>"

You might not have experienced this example before, but what is preventing you from making something up? To tell you the truth, I never experienced it before either. 
There are some things you shouldn't lie about because they can find out about it such as your GPA or what school you attended, but a story such as the one I included above cannot be verified by the interviewer. 
The only thing you have to be careful about is being able to answer follow up questions.

<h2>Are you better at anticipating or reacting to problems</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I16/sentence/I16S1.mp3">Which category do you fall under? A person who anticipates a problem well, or a person who reacts to a problem well?</a>"</b>

This is a tough question because both options look pretty good. 
My recommendation would be to answer depending on the position you are applying for. 
For example, if you are applying for a type of analyst or upper management position, then anticipating a problem would be more useful. 
However, if you are applying to be a nurse for a hospital emergency room, then reacting to a problem well is stronger.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I16/sentence/I16S2.mp3">I think it's good to be good at both. 
But in my experience, I realized I react to problems better.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I16/sentence/I16S6.mp3">I feel I react to problems well, but I'm much stronger at anticipating them. 
I'm a type of person that pays attention to detail, inconsistencies, and subtle signs. 
Basically, I want to find a potential problem and put measures in place to correct it before it happens. 
It's interesting to see how the people who deal with problems get rewarded for resolving the issue. 
What about the people who put the fire out before it even started? So anticipating problems before it happens is what I've always done and I believe it's important in any work environment.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I16/sentence/I16S7.mp3">Being a nurse requires many skills. 
One of the important traits is to be able to react to problems well. 
Reacting to a problem well requires the ability for quick thinking, ability to think of all the options available, and maintaining self control in hectic times. 
In my spare time, I even think about creative problems that might come up. 
Since a problem can arise at any time and in any form, I try to be as creative as I can and I walk through the situation as if I'm dealing with the problem. 
So this has helped me to become very good at reacting to problems.</a>"

This also depends on the position. 
But in most cases, I believe someone who likes to take risks is a better candidate. 
If you choose to answer saying you are a risk taker, you should include why and how you take risks.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I17/sentence/I17S2.mp3">I consider myself to be in the middle, but if I were to choose from my past experience, I would think I would call myself a careful risk taker.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I17/sentence/I17S6.mp3">I see myself as a risk taker. 
But before taking the risk, I always evaluate all other options, weigh the pro's and con's of success and failure, and after careful consideration, I would definitely take a risk if the rewards were high enough. 
I view staying away from risks similar to staying away from a gold mine surrounded by dynamite. 
Of course if you don't know what triggers the dynamite, it would be unwise to take that risk. 
But if you study the situation and know the location of all dynamite and the way they are triggered, then the risk is minimized. 
Some people would not explore the options to reduce the risk, but I would definitely study each situation and take a risk that would improve my personal or company's situation.</a>"

You don't have to use the dynamite example. 
You can think of any other example. 
But I used this to clearly explain what I feel about taking risks. 
Not only did I choose to be a risk taker, but I also explained how and when I would take risks.

<h2>Why should I hire you?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I18/sentence/I18S1.mp3">Why should I hire you?</a>"</b>

I don't know if this is a common question, but I heard many people use this question. 
In all the interviews I've been through, I never received this question, nor did I ask this question in any interviews I gave. 
But, there are a lot of people asking this question, so preparing for it is a must. 
To answer this question, you need to know exactly what they are looking for. 
With this information, tie it in with your strong traits. 
This will verify that you are completely qualified for the job. 
Second and more importantly, you need to stand out more than the other people interviewing for this position. 
I will give two examples for the long answers, one for a person with a lot of experience, and the other for a recent college graduate.

At ABC Software Company, I was in charge of a team that was responsible for the quality of three different applications. 
I have intimate knowledge of quality assurance, product support, and even some creative processes that will benefit a quality assurance team. 
I've built a team from scratch and fully understand the product development cycle. 
Finally, one of my traits is in developing and mentoring junior employees. 
I believe in transferring knowledge to everyone in the company and investing a little more effort into the people who work for me. 
So I strongly believe that I'll be the best candidate due to the combination of my experience, my managerial skills, and my desire to provide growth in employees.</a>"

My education background and my strengths show that I can do this job. 
But I want to make more of an impact than just doing my job. 
I don't want to blend in with the company, I would rather want my addition to improve it.</a>"

The first answer is using experience and skills to convince the interviewer to hire him or her. 
In addition to talking about past experiences, this example also emphasizes the strong ability to mentor people. 
The second example is more on the personal level and definitely more creative. 
Everyone one will claim to have all the good traits. 
So this candidate says it by saying, "... the truth is that many people have these traits." On top of these traits, this candidate is including passion and excitement. 
This is very important during interviews. 
Finally, the last sentence is a good line that the interviewer will remember. 
It is creative and bold.

<h2>Tell me about Q's... / Tell me about a time you made a mistake.</h2>

<b>'Tell me about...'</b> type of questions are very popular. 
It is more effective because it is asking for an answer that comes from experience. 
If you don't have a particular experience in one of the questions below, make one up. 
You should prepare ahead of time because you don't want to make up a story during the interview. 
It will be too hard to sound believable. 
Finally, you should know that some questions will not be asked to certain job types. 
For example, if you are not in a management position, you probably won't be asked how you saved the company money. 
Or if you are not in sales, you won't be asked about making a great sale.

These types of answers are usually long because it is explaining an experience. 
If you want the interviewer to understand the significance of your story, they will need to understand it. 
So all my examples will be a little longer than regular interview questions. 
Finally, a lot of these are my own experiences. 
I encourage you to think back to your experience and create one.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I19/sentence/I19S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you made a mistake.</a>"</b>

The best answer for this question involves learning something from a mistake. 
If you are having difficulty thinking about a mistake you made that will be an effective answer, try to think of a lesson you learned that improved a good trait. 
Making a mistake is not good, but since you have to tell them something, you should tell them something that makes you look good. 
For an example, let's create a scenario where you learned how to be someone who anticipates problems.

<b>Short Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I19/sentence/I19S2.mp3">I was given a project to complete in a week. 
I understood the project, but I misinterpreted one section. 
After completing the project, I was told by my manager that it was done incorrectly. 
I really made a mistake by assuming incorrectly in one of the sections instead of asking for clarification. 
I learned not to assume through the mistake I made.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I19/sentence/I19S3.mp3">I had a project I was working on, and while I was in the middle of typing up my documentation, my computer started acting weird. 
It froze for a while and so I rebooted. 
After 10 minutes, the computer showed a blue screen saying that there were problems and recommended that I reboot the computer again. 
After another reboot, everything appeared to be ok. 
I continued my work and finished for the day. 
I spent two days on this assignment and when I went to retrieve my data the next day to double check my work, my computer wouldn't start up. 
A technician came and found that my hard drive malfunctioned. 
I lost all the data and lost two days of work. 
I was disappointed and thought I would never trust a computer again, but there was a great lesson to be learned. 
I had a couple of warnings and I ignored them. 
From then on, I practiced being someone who can anticipate problems. 
I now think of potential problems ahead of time and pay attention to details along the way. 
If I applied this sooner, I would have saved the data on another computer and I wouldn't have lost a couple days of work. 
But I can't say I regret making the mistake because it made me someone who can anticipate problems better.</a>"

This is a minor mistake, and you can say it is really the computer's fault. 
But this is a good example because I wasn't really at fault. 
The computer was. 
But this example is wording it so it looks like the person's fault and it explains how a great lesson was learned. 
In the end, this candidate became a better person through this mistake. 
Learning from a mistake is probably the key point here, and this example demonstrates that.

<h2>Tell me about a time you made a good decision.</h2>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I20/sentence/I20S2.mp3">Tell me about a time you found a solution to a problem.</a>"</b>

This is a little easier than thinking about a mistake. 
You should make sure to include why it was a good decision and the result should be obviously meaningful. 
I also want to use this as an example of answering multiple questions. 
I would use this same answer for either of the two questions above. 
It was a good decision, and I fond a solution to a problem. 
Preparing for every interview question in the world will be too much work. 
Think of key experiences and apply them to multiple answers. 
In the case where it is the same interviewer, then you might be forced to think of a new answer. 
So it might be good to think of couple of answers.

This was high priority so everyone was instructed to find a solution.

I made a decision to use every resource I could find, and in the end, it solved the problem.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I20/sentence/I20S4.mp3">In my last position at Microsoft, there was a time period where our group was going to slip reaching our milestone by one day. 
This was because the day before exiting the third milestone, we found a problem in the program. 
Since we created a new build with all bug fixes each morning, we had two choices. 
We could either fix the problem and verify the program the next day after we build again, or we could postpone the problem and fix it in the next milestone. 
Both options didn't sound very appealing. 
I suggested fixing the program now, and perform another build to verify the fix instead of waiting for tomorrow. 
Many times people are used to following a process, but in this case, I challenged the process of building in the morning and requested another build to verify the last bug fix. 
In the end, we were able to complete milestone 3 on time and fixed the important problem. 
This was significant because if we didn't exit milestone 3, then everyone waiting to start work on the next milestone would have to wait another day. 
In essence, this saved a days work for more than 30 people.</a>"

For this example, I was careful not to use too many technical jargons that might not be understood. 
I also explained the situation carefully and explained why the decision was a good one. 
Remember that some of these answers will not work for you. 
In this case, if you never worked at Microsoft and never experienced this, just follow the steps of stating the problem, explaining the choices, why you made the decision, and finally why it was a good decision.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I21/sentence/I21S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you made a poor decision.</a>"</b>

This question is similar to the mistake question. 
So first, let's think about what lesson we want to learn. 
A common mistake is when people make assumptions. 
I'll give an example where a poor decision was made due to making a bad assumption. 
The answer will also include what was learned and how the poor decision was used as a tool to become a better worker.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I21/sentence/I21S3.mp3">In my first month working at Tiffany's selling jewelry, I made a poor decision by making an assumption. 
A person buying an engagement diamond wanted to see some rings. 
It's not polite to immediately ask for a price range, so I showed the person a variety of rings. 
He pointed to a ring that was about twelve thousand dollars. 
The diamond ring he pointed to was one of the more expensive ones I showed him. 
Eager to sell him the ring, I explained the quality of the ring, explained our satisfaction guarantee policy to him, and made sure he was comfortable with making a purchase at Tiffany's. 
He bought the ring, and I thought I made a great sell. 
However, it turns out that on my day off, he came in and exchanged the ring for one that was twenty five thousand dollars. 
It was one of the rings that I didn't show him. 
So basically, I made a bad decision on selling him what he first pointed out instead of showing him more options. 
I assumed that the initial ring he selected was the price range he was looking for. 
I never made that mistake again and I learned that I shouldn't assume so much.</a>"

This example is geared towards sales, but like I said earlier, make sure to clearly explain the situation, identify the decisions, explain why it was a bad decision, and most importantly what you learned by making a poor decision.

Firing someone is a difficult task. 
Usually you will not be asked this question unless it is for a management position. 
You should emphasize a couple of key things when you answer this question. 
First, you should be very professional about firing someone. 
Second, you should mention the procedures you took so the action of firing is justified.

Initially, we put him on probation monitoring his work, we tried to give him different types of work that he might do better at, and we even assigned a mentor to him. 
However, even through all this, he was a weak performer. 
I consulted with other management members and we all agreed it was best for the company to let him go. 
I got together with an HR representative and told him that he no longer has a job here. 
He wasn't surprised at all.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I22/sentence/I22S5.mp3">I've never had to fire somebody yet.

But I know that there are some people who can't or won't perform despite management's best effort.

Both of these are good answers. 
They mention that a manager should take actions to make the worker better, but sometimes turning something bad to something good is impossible, so the only action is to fire someone. 
The person with experience outlines the steps taken. 
For example, the probation, assigning different work, providing a mentor, etc. 
Then in the end he was fired. 
The second example shows despite experience, that he or she would fire someone in a professional manner following procedure.

But when the person started, he had a hard time understanding new concepts. 
I originally thought it was because he was new and had to ramp up on many things, but as months past by, this employee was still unable to work alone.

The first question is straight forward. 
This person took it one step farther by making a phone call and encouraging the candidate to join his team. 
But the second answer is an example of doing everything right, but seeing bad results. 
You can use something like this, but if you do, you must think of follow up questions such as, 'what did you do to this employee? What happened in the long run? Did you end up firing this person' But I recommend you think of a situation that you personally experienced. 
Then you can answer all follow up questions easily. 
But if you never hired anyone before, then simply say that. 
It shouldn't hurt unless it is for a recruiting position.

I estimated that it will take three additional days. 
They insisted that we finish on the agreed upon time schedule. 
I told them we'd try but could not promise anything. 
Even with hard work and overtime, we missed the due date. 
We did however, finish one day late. 
In this situation where I didn't feel we could reach the deadline, I specifically told them that we couldn't, I continually sent updates on the progress to keep the clients informed. 
Since we missed the deadline, they were not too happy, but overall they were satisfied because I effectively communicated the progress regularly.</a>"

I like this answer because they want a situation that should make you look bad. 
Instead, you gave them a scenario where you failed to complete an assignment, but really it wasn't your fault. 
In the end, this answer makes you look good because you did everything right from communicating properly, giving them a new time frame, and reaching the goal two days ahead of schedule despite missing the original date by one.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I25/sentence/I25S2.mp3">Hmmm... I wasn't really in any position to save the company money, but I have one small example. 
When we were a smaller company, we didn't get a significant corporate discount on our hardware. 
After we grew in size, we qualified for the larger discount, but nobody realized that we now met the quota. 
I pointed this out and we started saving 5% more on our hardware.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I25/sentence/I25S3.mp3">We were outsourcing a portion of our work to a 3rd party company. 
We had two phases for this project. 
After the first phase, I was given the task to complete the work because the original worker responsible for this project left our group. 
I quickly got up to speed on the details of the work. 
I analyzed the information and realized that one portion of the work given to them could've been done by our group because we already had the infrastructure in place. 
So I only spent half a day to set this up and in turn, we were charged 35% less for the second phase from the first one.</a>"

This is a simple story of an experience. 
It doesn't include every detail on the type of work that was outsourced, or what I specifically did during the half days of work. 
If they choose to ask this, then I will be prepared to answer it, but this answer gives enough details to allow the interviewer to understand how you contributed in saving the company money. 
Also, depending on the field of work, answers will vary. 
If your job specifically oversees the finance, then it is probably important to think of a much better answer specifically for that position. 
Think of some scenarios, write them down, and feel free to ask us if the grammar is correct.

<h2>Tell me about a time you aimed too high.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I26/sentence/I26S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you aimed too high.</a>"</b>

This is another question where you can turn this answer into a good experience. 
I am going to be using the answer as the one where you failed to complete an assignment on time. 
This is good practice to use a similar answer by changing only a few sentences to answer another tough interview question. 
But first, I'll give an example of a different short answer.

<b>Short Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I26/sentence/I26S2.mp3">We had a new project that I was interested in. 
Even though I was busy, I volunteered to take on the assignment. 
I had to work so much more. 
Although I managed to complete the assignment, it really burned me out. 
I feel I aimed too high and I would have benefited by doing a better job on my current assignments instead of wanting more challenges.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I26/sentence/I26S3.mp3">I believe aiming high is a good practice. 
Aiming high keeps me focused and forces me to grow by trying to reach high goals I have set for myself. 
But I know there are times where aiming too high is not good. 
For example, one time in the middle of the project, our clients wanted to change one aspect of the assignment that we already completed. 
I analyzed the change request and told them that we will not be able to make the date. 
I estimated that it will take three additional days. 
They insisted that we finish on the agreed upon time schedule. 
I told them we would try but we could not promise anything. 
Even with hard work and overtime, we missed the due date. 
We did however, finish one day later. 
I challenged myself to complete on time, but with the large change request, it was too high of a goal to reach. 
In this case, I really aimed too high. 
I should have been more firm telling them that we will need a few more days.</a>"

This is a similar experience we already used, but you changed the beginning and the end to tailor it to this question. 
Remember that you can use one answer for multiple questions. 
This answer should make you look good instead of looking like you made a terrible mistake.

<h2>Tell me about a time you aimed too low.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I27/sentence/I27S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you aimed too low.</a>"</b>

I have never been in sales, but the example answer I want to give is an example of answering the question while displaying good traits. 
Remember to be clear when explaining your experience and don't assume that they will understand everything. 
You should explain it step by step.

<b>Short Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I27/sentence/I27S2.mp3">There was a new project that I was interested in. 
Because I had other responsibilities, I didn't volunteer. 
I wasn't too busy, but I was worried I wouldn't complete the assignment on time. 
I realized I missed a wonderful opportunity because I aimed too low.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I27/sentence/I27S3.mp3">When I was selling cell phones for Verizon Wireless, I had a great month where I reached the quota in just two weeks. 
My goal is to always break quota by more than 10 percent, and this month, I new it was going to be easy. 
I scheduled to take a week off to relax, and at the end of the month I surpassed the quota by 31%. I had an opportunity to break the location's record, but I didn't jump on the opportunity. 
I was basically thinking that having achieved my original goal of 10% was sufficient. 
But I think when opportunities arise, I should be flexible and willing to change my goal. 
I aimed too low and I missed a rare opportunity.</a>"

This is not a bad mistake. 
You can say you were burned out, or needed to take some time off, or wanted to rejuvenate yourself. 
This answer doesn't show a failure, but shows a great success. 
In this example, aiming too low resulted in great numbers and great results at the end of the month, so there is no harm done. 
In the end you are indicating that you could have done even better, that you are willing to re-evaluate your goals, and that you are now able to see and jump on opportunities.

<h2>Tell me about a time you made a great sale.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I28/sentence/I28S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you made a great sale.</a>"</b>

This is similar to the question, 'what does it mean to make a great sale' You can change the words a little and use the answer for both questions. 
The key to this answer is explaining what it means to make a great sale, and then giving a good example of a great sale that you made.

<b>Short Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I28/sentence/I28S2.mp3">I had a customer come in that was a little rude. 
He had many questions and cut me off very frequently. 
I stayed patient and explained everything to his satisfaction. 
He ended up representing a medium sized business that required a large order. 
I feel this was a great sale because I treated this customer with respect and patience.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I28/sentence/I28S3.mp3">Making a great sale can be measured by how much the company made, but I think making a great sale is how satisfied the customer is. 
A satisfied customer will return and continue to be a valued customer, so it's important to make sure that the customer is satisfied. 
One day, a customer was debating on two different types of watches. 
One was $1200 and the other was $400. This was a huge difference. 
I believe I could have sold him the $1200 watch, but instead, I laid out all the pro's and con's for him, and asked him questions to find out the purpose of the watch, if it was for casual wear or formal wear, and eventually helped him realize exactly what he was looking for. 
He ended up buying the $400 watch. 
Some people might think that was not a great sale, but I felt as a salesman and a person representing the company that I did a great job in satisfying this customer. 
In the next couple of years while I was working there, he came and bought many more items and had other friends come in to buy more products. 
I can confidently say that the $800 in missed sale resulted in thousands more for the company.</a>"

This example has several key points. 
First, this answer is telling the interviewer what you believe is a great sale. 
Second, it is giving a good example. 
Finally, it is showing a good sign of an employee by saying, 'a person representing the company' All salesman or someone who works with customers is representing their company in some way. 
Saying this casually in an example is definitely powerful.

<h2>Tell me about a time you went over budget.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I29/sentence/I29S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you went over budget.</a>"</b>

If you go over budget, it is a bad sign. 
It can mean you are not organized, do not plan well, or are not good with finance. 
So when you think of an answer, make sure you justify it with a good reason. 
Here is an example of what I am talking about.

<b>Short Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I29/sentence/I29S2.mp3">During our marketing campaign, we realized how many customers we were gaining through the radio advertisements. 
Although we didn't have budget for more radio advertisement, I still made the decision to place our ad on three more stations. 
We increased sales by 25% for that month, but I ended up going over budget by 5%.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I29/sentence/I29S3.mp3">There was a project that had a strict 4 month deadline. 
I didn't have enough employees to complete the task, so I had to hire temporary workers. 
I was given a budget to either hire three extra heads for four months or to hire four extra heads for three months. 
Because of the importance of the project and the strict deadline, I chose to hire 4 temporary workers for 3 months to give us a time cushion at the end. 
We had a couple of unexpected obstacles and it turned out that we needed the temporary workers for another two weeks. 
We completed the project on time and everything turned out well, but in this instance, I went over budget by 5%. Due to the importance of this project, I didn't want to risk slipping the date. 
Even though everyone was congratulating me on this accomplishment, I feel I could have done better if I calculated a cushion for unexpected obstacles.</a>"

This answer is admitting to going over budget, but the reason was good enough. 
The answer indicates that by saying how everyone was happy and making sure to say how important the project was. 
In the end you say you learned something. 
But you can change this answer a little. 
If you want to be more clear on the importance of the project, you can say a monetary value, like it was a two million dollar deal, and going over budget by $10,000 was acceptable by upper management.

<h2>What extracurricular activities were you involved in?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I30/sentence/I30S1.mp3">What extracurricular activities were you involved in?</a>"</b>

If you don't have any work experience, then a company wants to know what extra activities you did in school to see if you are active. 
It is best to list a couple of things describing what the group is and what role you had in the group. 
If you were not a part of any group, it might be ok to make something up. 
It is hard to verify this so they will not find out. 
But it could back fire, if the interviewer happened to be in the same group at the same university.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I30/sentence/I30S2.mp3">I was involved in our school newspaper.

I was a member of that group for four years. 
I helped write articles about events occurring in school. 
In my senior year, I was the editor and did less writing and more managing in regards to the magazine structure, what contents to add, and distributing work among the junior members of the group. 
I really enjoyed my experience there and learned about working closely together as a group to deliver a quality magazine.</a>"

If you don't have work experience, then you will need to say something to show them that you learned some valuable lessons such as team work. 
I suggest you to reflect on what you did during school and create a list of what you learned.

<h2>Why did you choose your major?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I31/sentence/I31S1.mp3">Why did you choose your major?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I31/sentence/I31S2.mp3">Why did you choose to major in History?</a>"</b>

If you are a computer science major interviewing for a computer position, then they will not ask you this question. 
But if you are an English Literature major and interview for a computer position, then they might want to know why you chose to major in English Literature. 
To create an answer for English Literature, you can say things learning to be a better communicator, having better reading comprehension, and say how skills learned from English Literature can be applied towards many fields. 
But something like History is different. 
Unless you are going to be a Historian, it's hard to justify how your major is going to help you in your job.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I31/sentence/I31S3.mp3">I majored in History because I enjoyed learning about the past.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I31/sentence/I31S5.mp3">I majored in Psychology because I was interested in seeing how the mind works. 
I also found it useful because it helped me to work with people better by understanding differences in everyone.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I31/sentence/I31S6.mp3">I majored in Biology because I initially wanted to go to med school. 
Although I decided not to go to med school, I still wanted to complete my bachelor's degree.</a>"

It's totally different from history but it really fascinated me. 
Now, instead of looking in the past, I'm always looking into the future through all the technological changes.</a>"

It doesn't connect the major to the job but at least it gives an explanation. 
It's not bad to say you majored in something because you liked the subject. 
The only bad answer is to say you didn't know what else to do and you couldn't get into a better department.

<h2>If you redo college again, what would you major in?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I32/sentence/I32S1.mp3">If you redo college again, what would you major in?</a>"</b>

I already explained this a little in another question about restarting your career. 
You can use the same answer here if you want, but I will give one more example of not changing your major in the long answer section.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I32/sentence/I32S2.mp3">I didn't realize I was so interested in computers until I graduated college.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I32/sentence/I32S6.mp3">If I were to redo college again, I don't think I would change my major. 
I liked the fact that I majored in Business and I believe it will help me with my career. 
I'm pretty good with the computer, but I would like to have taken more computer classes. 
Because technology is growing so quickly, I think I would have benefited from having a deeper understanding in computers.</a>"

This answer demonstrates a good choice in the beginning. 
I included the portion about computers because they want to see something you would have done differently. 
And making the comment about computers shows the interviewer your understanding about technology to some degree. 
But don't say this answer without first stating that you are pretty good with the computer.

<h2>What course did you like the most?</h2>

When you answer this question, use a subject that helped you become a better person or a better worker. 
Although this question is asking for you opinion and there is no wrong answer, you should take advantage of this question by showing your strengths.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I33/sentence/I33S3.mp3">I really enjoyed an English writing class I took.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I33/sentence/I33S7.mp3">I really enjoyed majoring in electrical engineering and it really helped me to prepare for my career, but the class I enjoyed the most is probably a couple of psychology classes I took. 
Although it didn't help me in any technical way, I learned a little bit about human behavior and learned how the brain works. 
I started to understand the reasons for my strengths and weakness instead of just knowing them. 
Also, it helped me to understand people who are different than me.</a>"

This is a simple answer but a very good one. 
An engineer is mostly technical and they might lack skills in human interaction. 
So an engineer saying their favorite course was psychology demonstrates that this person has both technical skills and the ability to work with others better. 
It lists several good examples such as understanding both strengths and weakness along with understanding different people.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I34/sentence/I34S1.mp3">What course did you like the least?</a>"

This is an easier answer because you don't have to show off your strength here. 
All you have to do is make sure you don't pick a subject that relates to your job. 
It is also safer to pick something that most people do not enjoy. 
Finally, picking something that you are not good at is acceptable if it is not a skill required on the job. 
My long example will be about a drama class.

I didn't realize that I was a terrible actor.

I say this because when I saw myself on video, oh my gosh, it was terrible.</a>"

You are putting yourself down a lot here, but in this example it is actually good. 
Interviewers are worried that a person who can act well will be able to lie about many things during the interview. 
A person without acting skills will not be able to hide automatic body gestures that the interviewer is looking at. 
Also, this answer is good because it shows that this person never gives up and puts in a lot of effort.

You can display traits such as endurance, effort, and willingness to work on things you don't like.

<h2>How would your best friend describe you?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I36/sentence/I36S1.mp3">How would your best friend describe you?</a>"</b>

This answer can be short. 
Use key words that show how you are a good fit for this position. 
If it if a salesperson, mention things like, an easy person to talk, good personality, and dependable as the traits. 
But if it is for a manager position, then you can use different words like organized, helpful, considerate, and smart. 
So it all depends on the position. 
Most people will be honest and say what the best friend will actually say, but it is more effective to choose the words so it relates to the job. 
Here are some examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I36/sentence/I36S2.mp3">Oh, let's see... I think my best friend would describe me as honest, detailed, and very organized.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I36/sentence/I36S3.mp3">I think my best friend would say that I'm very responsible. 
Whenever our group of friends had to coordinate an activity, they always relied on me.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I36/sentence/I36S4.mp3">My best friend would probably say that I'm warm, friendly, and understanding.</a>"

It doesn't have to be long, but don't blurt out the answer without thinking. 
Then it makes it appear as you are thinking about it instead of saying an answer you already prepared.

<h2>How would your professor describe you?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I37/sentence/I37S1.mp3">How would your professor describe you?</a>"</b>

Same thing here, but you can't choose any words. 
You have to choose one that relates to school work. 
Select words that are general and that applies to most types of jobs.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I37/sentence/I37S2.mp3">I think my professor would describe me as a great team member and consistent in my school work.</a>"

This is good because school has group projects. 
It shows team work experience and it also mentions consistency.

<h2>How would your mother describe you?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I38/sentence/I38S1.mp3">How would your mother describe you?</a>"</b>

You can use more personal words here because your mother knows you in a different way.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I38/sentence/I38S2.mp3">I think my mother would say I'm very friendly because I had a lot of friends and that I'm very focused because I always finish what I start.</a>"

This answer is showing two different types of characteristics. 
One is more personal and one is a good work trait. 
It also shows reasons by saying because... Overall, these types of questions are not that significant and a short answer that is good should be fine.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I38/sentence/I38S3.mp3">Since I was the oldest out of three, I think my mother would describe me as responsible and someone who is looked to for answers.</a>"

<h2>Why are you applying for a job that you didn't major in?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I39/sentence/I39S1.mp3">Why are you applying for a job that you didn't major in?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I39/sentence/I39S2.mp3">Why didn't you pursue a career in your major?</a>"</b>

In the United States the statistics for a person changing career paths is very high. 
It's something like an average person will change careers five times. 
Changing jobs is one thing, but completely changing careers is a big move. 
So this question is not that significant. 
If everyone worked in the industry as their major, then this question is more important, but because everyone changes jobs frequently, it's no big deal. 
You just have to use this opportunity to show them how much you like the current industry you are in.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I39/sentence/I39S3.mp3">I majored in English because I liked to write. 
Because I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, I majored in something I was very interested in. 
After working for a year on the marketing team, I realized that this is what I want to be doing.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I39/sentence/I39S4.mp3">I majored in History, but during my senior year, I had an opportunity to work at an accounting firm.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I39/sentence/I39S6.mp3">I enjoyed majoring in psychology, but I didn't want to become a psychologist. 
I just found the subject to be very interesting. 
It also helped me to understand a wide variety of things. 
For my career, I wanted to be doing something I was good at and what I enjoyed doing. 
I had an opportunity to work at a smaller logistics company as an administrative assistant. 
During that time period they were short handed and I actually got to do some planning and organizing for one of the smaller clients. 
I didn't lead anything, but I realized how much I enjoyed the work. 
Ever since then, I've been studying up on planning, logistics, and business.</a>"

This example does three things. 
It explains why this person is not going into a field related to their major, it is explaining why this person is going into logistics, and finally it is showing passion for the industry and a desire to learn. 
Since you are probably competing against people who majored in logistics, you need to make an impression with your answer. 
So you should definitely show enthusiasm here.

<h2>During college, how did you spend your summer vacations?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I40/sentence/I40S1.mp3">During college, how did you spend your summer vacations?</a>"</b>

The best answer is to have spent your summer productively such as working as an intern. 
Even if you did only one intern, the interviewer will like that. 
The worst answer is to say you didn't do anything. 
Or say you worked in the supermarket to get some money so you can party at night. 
So think of something productive, and if you don't have an intern experience, you can say that you spent your summer learning something new.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I40/sentence/I40S2.mp3">My last two summers of college, I did an intern for a consulting firm. 
I gained experience working on office solutions for large companies.</a>"

I went to Europe, Australia, Brazil, and China.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I40/sentence/I40S4.mp3">Every summer, I took extra English classes. 
I also took some drawing classes because it's one of my hobbies. 
So I spent my summers learning more things.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I40/sentence/I40S5.mp3">My first two summers, I had to work to save money for tuition. 
But after saving enough money, I had a free summer. 
I actually ended up taking some computer classes to prepare myself for the business world. 
These days it's a requirement to know computers, so I prepared for that.</a>"

Although I said don't mention useless work, it is ok if it is for tuition. 
It shows financial responsibility. 
Finally, taking some computer classes for the summer is a great way to prepare for work life and it was a summer well spent. 
Make sure you have an answer that shows productivity.

<h2>What did you learn from your internship?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I41/sentence/I41S1.mp3">What did you learn from your internship?</a>"</b>

If you worked as an intern, your resume will say it. 
Your resume should also include a list of what you learned during your internship. 
You can answer this question repeating what was on the resume, but using full sentence and with more enthusiasm.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I41/sentence/I41S2.mp3">In my final summer vacation, I had the opportunity to work as an intern for a public accounting firm. 
It was only for 3 months, but I learned a lot about performing quarterly tax services for small and medium size companies. 
I also learned to deal with time pressure and learned how to prioritize work to be more efficient. 
It was a great experience that I know will help me when I start my career.</a>"

<h2>Did you do any internships?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I42/sentence/I42S1.mp3">Did you do any internships?</a>"</b>

You should be asked this question if your resume doesn't have any internship experience, or if they didn't look at your resume. 
If you do have internship experience, then you can answer, that you do and say the same answer as the one provided with the question, what did you learn from your internship. 
But if you don't, you can simply answer that you didn't do any internship but give a good excuse.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I42/sentence/I42S2.mp3">Yes. 
I did two internships. 
The first internship was for Johnson and Johnson. 
I worked in the distribution team, and my second internship was for Starbucks. 
At Starbucks, I had the opportunity to work on overseas venture.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I42/sentence/I42S3.mp3">I did one internship for IBM. 
I was on the development team creating applications for business solutions.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I42/sentence/I42S4.mp3">I love to travel and I realized that when I start my career, I won't be able to travel for long durations. 
So I used my summers to travel a lot. 
I spent one summer in Europe for 2 months. 
I spent another summer traveling between China and some South East Asian countries, and finally, I took a road trip through the United States.</a>"

Traveling is not a bad answer. 
It is not as good as doing an internship, but definitely better than nothing. 
It is definitely not a wasted summer. 
Also, if the internship was useless and generic, then the interviewer will not remember this answer as a good answer. 
So it didn't do any good. 
In this case, traveling could be better because the example I gave is significant and interesting. 
Something different always stands out more.

This is another type of question that has no wrong or right answer. 
That means you need to make your answer a little more creative so it stands out.

But sometimes something goes wrong with the computer for no reason at all. 
Because I'm not a computer engineer, I have no idea what's going on. 
Basically, I have to wait for a technician to fix it. 
During these times, I want to kick the computer out of frustration. 
Mostly, it ends up being a problem I could have fixed if I new the details of how a computer works. 
So even though it's not in my job description, I want to know how to fix computers at a basic level.</a>"

I heard from many people who don't know computers that well that they get frustrated with them. 
So wanting to kick the computer is understandable and it is a little humorous. 
Wanting to learn a little more about the computer is always good and it would definitely help out with future work by not having to wait for a technician.

<h2>If you could start your career over again, what would you do differently?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I44/sentence/I44S1.mp3">If you could start your career over again, what would you do differently?</a>"</b>

This depends on several factors. 
If your university major is different than your career choice, then you could answer that you would choose a different major to prepare you for your choice in career. 
Or if you started at a small company and didn't have many opportunities, you can say that you would have started at a larger company. 
This is not a significant question so a regular answer should suffice.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I44/sentence/I44S2.mp3">I started my career at a small company. 
I feel I would have benefited more if I started at a larger company.

I'm great at what I do, but if I could start over again, I would probably choose to have majored in business administration.</a>"

This is an acceptable answer because the answer doesn't display any problems in the work history. 
Many people change careers or go into a field that is unrelated to their major. 
This is common, so answering this question using this answer is common. 
If you don't want to use this common answer, then thinking about a scenario early in your work career that you would have done differently might be more effective.

<h2>During your performance reviews, what criticism do you hear the most?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I45/sentence/I45S1.mp3">During your performance reviews, what criticism do you hear the most?</a>"</b>

This question is primarily for people with work experience. 
If you are fresh out of college, then you will not be asked this question. 
The answer to this question should not disclose any real faults. 
Instead, try to think of something that doesn't sound too bad. 
Here is what I hear at my reviews and this is how I would answer this question.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I45/sentence/I45S2.mp3">I heard that I need to be proactive. 
I always perform at an exceptional level, but I didn't volunteer for additional work. 
I wasn't accustomed to it so I'm glad that I received this criticism. 
I now practice keeping an eye out for additional projects I can take on.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I45/sentence/I45S3.mp3">During my review, my manager told me to voice my opinions more frequently.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I45/sentence/I45S4.mp3">My manager told me that I should send more updates. 
He told me I did my projects well, and that I was never late, but he would like more updates so he can report to his manager.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I45/sentence/I45S5.mp3">I actually like to receive criticism because it gives me information on how to improve. 
But the most common criticism I hear is hard to correct because I disagree with the comment. 
I'm told that I should be more visible. 
I'm told that I do great work and I do a lot of extra work, but in a large organization, it's important to visibly stand out. 
I'm not a person who likes to be secluded in the office. 
I like to go out and collaborate, I like to work with people, and I email my co-workers with valuable information that will help with their job, so I can't say I agree, but I always try to be more visible.</a>"

This criticism is actually a common comment used by managers if they can't give you a good review score but have nothing bad to say about you. 
In large organizations, you are measured against your peers. 
That means if you do well, you might get a bad review score because everyone did better. 
Likewise, if you are just mediocre and everyone else is terrible, you will get a good review score. 
Because of this system, I'm regularly told to be more visible. 
So when I answer this question, I make sure to back up my disagreement with examples of being visible.

<h2>Tell me about your last three positions?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I46/sentence/I46S1.mp3">Tell me about your last three positions?</a>"</b>

This type of question is generally asked by lazy interviewers who want to hear you talk for a while. 
A better question would be to separate the three positions and ask them one by one. 
But some people will ask this question, so you should definitely prepare for it. 
You can use this as your advantage. 
If you don't have many good things to say about your second position, you can briefly comment on it and spend more time talking about the other two positions. 
I'll give an example in the long answer, but here are some short answers first.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I46/sentence/I46S2.mp3">I've only had one position.

I learned a great deal about retail stores, about sales and working with customers, and became more independent. 
I thought I learned a great deal and enjoyed my work, but I wanted to experience different types of work. 
So I started working for Verizon. 
I had an office job and did a variety of different tasks such as planning, data entry, and organizing projects. 
I learned a little about the office setting, but I wanted to get back into sales. 
So I was given an opportunity to sell cell phones for Verizon at a retail store. 
I used my past sales experience and worked hard becoming one of the top sales person three years in a row. 
I've been there ever since.</a>"

I haven't worked at three different positions, so I just made one up. 
The question is pretty general, so the answer is pretty general. 
It does emphasize sales skill and coming back to the type of work that this person enjoys. 
But you should think of something that is related to the position you are interviewing for. 
Only thing you should be concerned about it clearly explaining your past three positions, what you learned there, and if you did something notable, include that as well.

<h2>Tell me about your last position?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I47/sentence/I47S1.mp3">Tell me about your last position? What did you do and how did you do it? Include the people you worked for and the people you worked with.</a>"</b>

This question is a little better than asking about the last three positions. 
It is more direct and focuses on getting more information about the last position. 
You might not get this question with so much detail. 
It might just be, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I47/sentence/I47S2.mp3">Tell me about your last position.</a>" But you can use the other questions as a guide when answering this question. 
You should mention what you did, how you did it, how you work in a team, what you learned, how well you did your job, etc.

Along with working with experienced and knowledgeable client's, I also had to work with junior level accountants that didn't know all the details of auditing. 
I was clear and concise in asking for what I needed. 
In the last year I was working as the senior auditor, I planned and organized each visit to our client's site. 
I regularly trained and managed new members of our team and I was the go to person for technical auditing questions.</a>"

The question wanted detail so the answer has to be a little long detailing some of the highlights of the last job. 
I included the type of people I worked for, the people I work with, the job description, and included that I was a great team member and a leader at the last position. 
Most of you will not be in the accounting field, so you can't use this example. 
But you should follow the steps of being detailed and showing off your strengths.

<h2>What is your management philosophy?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I48/sentence/I48S1.mp3">What is your management philosophy?</a>"</b>

This is another question only for managers and above. 
You can make this short or long, but in the least it should be an answer that stands out. 
Think of a guideline that you follow as a manager that you think is a good philosophy to follow.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I48/sentence/I48S2.mp3">I think management should provide guidance, direction, leadership, and finally set an example to subordinates.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I48/sentence/I48S3.mp3">My management philosophy is to provide an environment that leads to productive employees.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I48/sentence/I48S5.mp3">Before I was in management, I had many types of managers. 
I learned a lot from observing their management styles. 
I also learned a lot from the bad managers I had. 
I had a manger who was never there, another that didn't care, and another that had a phrase similar to, 'do as I say, not as I do.' So the traits I acquired are from my good managers such as working smart instead of working long, but the philosophy I always think about is from my bad managers. 
So I believe I should lead by example, provide guidance and growth by giving important feedback, and to be accessible to everyone.</a>"

If you want a shorter answer that is to the point, you can consider this one.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I48/sentence/I48S6.mp3">I believe management should provide guidance for employees to do their job well. 
This includes several meanings. 
First, it means management should provide challenging tasks related to the job that gives employees experience. 
This also stretches their abilities and brings growth. 
Also, by guiding employees to do their job well, it benefits the company by having productive employees.</a>"

Questions that are related to what you think should differ person to person. 
So think what your management philosophy is and write it down. 
Put more thought into it and then you will be able to explain exactly what you mean. 
If you have no idea, then consider what I wrote down in my two examples above.

<h2>What was your favorite job?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I49/sentence/I49S1.mp3">What was your favorite job?</a>"</b>

I have never been asked this question, but I know some people who ran into it. 
That means you should at least give it a little thought so you can think of a good answer ahead of time. 
The best way to answer this question is to select a job that is most similar to the job that you are applying for. 
For example, if a person who is applying to be a financial analyst says their favorite job was being a salesman, then the answer is basically useless and not effective at all. 
Rather, you should say that you like your last marketing job because you have passion for it and you really enjoy it. 
Many people fail interviews based on lack of enthusiasm. 
So make sure you show them that you love the job you are applying for.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I49/sentence/I49S2.mp3">My favorite job was working as a financial analyst.

That's why I'm applying for this job. 
It's similar to my last position and I really enjoyed it. 
Even though I really like my job, I want to experience the same work for a larger company. 
That's the primary reason for wanting to leave my current job.</a>"

This answer is brief but effective. 
It states that this person loves marketing. 
The second part of the answer is basically answering a question before it is asked. 
If you love your job, why are you leaving? You can answer this in several ways, but my example is using the excuse of wanting to work for a larger company because it shows that I want to take the next step in my career. 
It shows that I want to grow and that I want to go to bigger and better opportunities. 
Basically, it is showing a little ambition without saying it directly.

<h2>Tell me about the best manager you ever had.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I50/sentence/I50S1.mp3">Tell me about the best manager you ever had.</a>"</b>

This question is primarily used to see what you value in a manager. 
The best way to answer this question is to explain a little bit about the manager and list the things you respect. 
Also include that you learned how to become a good manager through your experience with your good manager.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I50/sentence/I50S2.mp3">My favorite manager was a person with a lot of knowledge. 
She stood her ground firmly and knew the best process to take by analyzing all the information.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I50/sentence/I50S3.mp3">My favorite manager was very trusting and easy to approach. 
I grew in many ways under this manager and I valued his method of dealing with directs.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I50/sentence/I50S4.mp3">I had a manager that worked efficiently. 
Instead of bossing everyone around, he set an example of hard work through his actions. 
I respected that trait and learned to be more like him by working smarter.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I50/sentence/I50S5.mp3">The best manager I had was during my first year at Microsoft. 
Since then, I have been under many different managers, but nobody matched up to his level. 
I respected him the most because of two reasons. 
He spent a great deal of time mentoring me and teaching me many work related things. 
I became a great employee because of him. 
And second, he produced the greatest amount of quality work among all the other managers. 
I always wondered how he could spend so much time with me and still find ways to out perform other managers. 
But that is where I learned how to work smart and efficiently. 
He showed me how to be the best employee through his action and through the individual lessons he gave me. 
I was so happy to have had a great manager early in my career.</a>"

This is an easy answer for me because I was truly amazed at my first manager. 
I made sure to explain why he was the best manager and what I learned from him. 
Another reason why it is important to be able to answer this question is because most great employees were taught by a great manager.

<h2>Tell me about the worst manager you ever had.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I51/sentence/I51S1.mp3">Tell me about the worst manager you ever had.</a>"</b>

Just like learning from a good manager, you should learn from bad managers as well. 
When you tell the reason why your manager was bad, make sure to include that you learned not to be like that.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I51/sentence/I51S2.mp3">In my last position, I had a manager who didn't like to give instructions. 
I managed to figure a lot of it out, but I would have saved a lot of time if my manager gave a simple 5 minute overview on the project.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I51/sentence/I51S3.mp3">I had one manager that was very disorganized. 
Whenever I ask a question, he would look around his desk for a couple minutes looking for information to give to me. 
I like to be organized so this trait really bothered me.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I51/sentence/I51S4.mp3">One manager didn't like talking to people. 
He always had his office door closed and whenever anyone asked a question, he seemed disturbed. 
He was very intelligent and produced a great deal of work, but as a manager, I believe you should be approachable by your directs.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I51/sentence/I51S5.mp3">The worst manager I had was when I was working at a database company. 
I didn't like my manager because he was never available. 
When ever he was given an assignment, he always delegated the work without explaining the details. 
We were told to figure it out. 
I believe that you can learn from figuring some things out by ourselves, but it was obvious that this wasn't his intention. 
But the worst thing about it was that I didn't know that he was bad until I changed to a different manager. 
He kept feeding us false hope saying we are close to being promoted. 
Basically it was a way to keep us motivated to work extra hard. 
Sure it worked for a while, but I didn't gain anything else out of it except what not to be as a manager.</a>"

This is a pretty easy answer that just explains the behavior of a bad manager. 
If you haven't had many managers, then it might be difficult to think of one. 
But you should definitely think of an answer even if you have to bend the truth a little. 
Although my example was ordinary, you can make a better answer by listing out what you learned through your bad manager.

<h2>What could you have done to improve your relationship with a manager you didn't like?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I52/sentence/I52S1.mp3">What could you have done to improve your relationship with a manager you didn't like?</a>"</b>

This question could be a follow up to the question about having a bad manager. 
In my case, I didn't know he was a bad manager until I switched managers. 
But here is a generic answer that shows professionalism.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I52/sentence/I52S2.mp3">If I communicated my problems earlier, I feel we both would have benefited. 
I waited several months before approaching my manager, and after our talk, our relationship got much better. 
So I could have improved my relationship by talking about problems sooner than later.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I52/sentence/I52S3.mp3">I feel I should be more understanding of different work styles. 
I didn't like my manager not communicating enough, but that didn't mean we couldn't approach him. 
So I'm learning to work seamlessly with different types of people.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I52/sentence/I52S4.mp3">One of my managers gave too much criticism. 
I value criticism, but hearing something negative every other day was difficult. 
I think I could have communicated how the criticism affected me in order to improve our relationship.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I52/sentence/I52S5.mp3">I had a manager in the past I didn't like that much, but I couldn't say he was a bad manager. 
Our personalities conflicted and we had some arguments. 
This affected my performance and willingness to work in the beginning, but I asked myself this same question. 
I thought I should try to get along with my manager despite my personal feelings. 
I set them aside and maintained a professional relationship. 
Taking this approach really helped. 
Because I was willing to look past minor differences, our work relationship got stronger and I performed at a higher level.</a>"

This answer shows that this person took proper actions before it was too late. 
It shows that this candidate has the ability to work with managers and team members despite personal differences or feelings of dislike. 
When you think of your own answer, make sure you answer this question showing that you dealt with this problem before and that you overcame the situation.

<h2>What were the most memorable accomplishments in your last position?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I53/sentence/I53S1.mp3">What were the most memorable accomplishments in your last position?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I53/sentence/I53S2.mp3">What were the most memorable accomplishments in your last career?</a>"</b>

Both of these questions can be answered with the same question. 
If you do not have much experience, it might be hard to think of a good answer. 
Also, if your previous job was very simple or followed a regular routine, then a memorable accomplishment might be hard to think about. 
So take a lot of time to think of anything. 
Because answering this question with nothing to say is basically the only wrong answer. 
Here are some ideas. 
Did you save the company money? Did you create a new process and put it into place? Did you break a sales record? Did you meet a difficult deadline? You can use all of these types of experience for this answer.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I53/sentence/I53S3.mp3">I remember the day I completed an audit from beginning to end all by myself.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I53/sentence/I53S6.mp3">My last position was selling copy machines. 
I had one month where I broke the sales record for a given month. 
I think that was a great accomplishment. 
However, throughout the calendar year, I exceeded the average number of sales by 20% ten out of twelve months. 
Having a great month is good, but I feel it is a greater accomplishment maintaining solid numbers throughout the whole year.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I53/sentence/I53S7.mp3">I think the greatest accomplishment in my last position was implementing a simple process that reduced the number of broken builds by 20%. Whenever we have a broken build, it slows down work for 20 different people. 
That puts risk on slipping the ship date. 
But my process involved following 25 steps prior to building to ensure a successful build. 
The 25 steps only took 15 minutes to complete and we reduced the number of build breaks significantly. 
It worked for our product and upper management instructed other groups in our organization to put this process in place. 
I really felt excited about that accomplishment.</a>"

These two examples are different. 
One is for a sales position and the second is for a technical engineer position. 
Both of them are great accomplishments. 
Sales is easy to answer because you can just throw out numbers and it sounds good. 
The second is a little more difficult because you have to explain the situation a little. 
But make sure you explain your scenario enough so the interviewer can see the significance of your contribution.

<h2>Why do you want to leave your current job?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I54/sentence/I54S1.mp3">Why do you want to leave your current job?</a>"</b>

There are many wrong answers to this question. 
Some of them include saying things like, I hate my job, I hate the company, I'm not appreciated there, I hate my boss, I'm sick of working there, etc. 
Basically, anything negative is a bad answer. 
If you say something negative, they will think you will eventually get into that situation again while working for them. 
So I highly recommend you have a good answer that leaves a positive impression while displaying good traits.

This answer shows a couple of good traits. 
It also shows excitement and mentions the company name. 
It is personal and direct. 
This is a generic answer so you can use this if you want. 
If you decide to think of your own, make sure it displays good traits and the reason for wanting to leave your current job is not a negative reason.

<h2>Where did you tell your boss you were going?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I55/sentence/I55S1.mp3">Where did you tell your boss you were going?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I55/sentence/I55S2.mp3">Where does your boss think you are?</a>"</b>

I highly doubt you will be asked this question. 
But it is true that interviews are conducted during office hours. 
That means if you are employed, then you will have to have a reason for not working. 
There are a couple of options. 
If the interview is less than two hours, you can schedule one during lunch time. 
If so, you can say you told your boss that you had to take care of some personal matters and you are taking an extended lunch. 
Another option is to tell the interviewer that your boss is aware of your interview schedule. 
But make sure it is true. 
I don't know what the best way to answer this question. 
But if I had to respond to this question, I would answer by saying I'm taking a personal day, or a vacation day. 
But make sure you don't say you are using a sick day. 
That is a complete lie and the interviewer will see that you are willing to lie for your personal gain.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I55/sentence/I55S3.mp3">I wasn't required to tell my boss because I used one of my vacation days to be here. 
I'm really excited to have this interview opportunity and using a vacation day was very well worth it.</a>"

This answer is turning an awkward question into an opportunity to show enthusiasm for the interview and the company. 
This is a key example where little things count. 
By adding the last sentence, the interviewer is sure to remember your answer more. 
That is because he or she will see your enthusiasm and excitement. 
If all the answers are the same, this one will be sure to stand out. 
When interviewing, everyone has similar answers. 
The key is to find opportunities to put in little extra comments to give you the advantage.

<h2>Are you currently employed at the last place listed on your resume?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I56/sentence/I56S1.mp3">Are you currently employed at the last place listed on your resume?</a>"</b>

This is a simple yes or no answer. 
I do not recommend lying. 
They can find out and if they catch you lying, then you lost your chance at this job. 
The reason this question is important is because someone who is currently employed appears to be a better candidate than someone who doesn't have a job. 
I do not believe it is true that an employed person is better qualified for any job, but it is one of those things that most people grew up with. 
If you are currently employed, then simply answer yes. 
You don't have to say anything else. 
If no, then you can say something to justify your reason for not having a job. 
But make sure it is a good reason. 
Otherwise, it might be better to simply answer, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I56/sentence/I56S2.mp3">No, I'm not currently employed.</a>"

<h2>What is the title of the person you report to?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I57/sentence/I57S1.mp3">What is the title of the person you report to? What responsibilities does he or she have?</a>"</b>

This is a trick question for people who are giving them a bigger title. 
An interviewer will know what you really did by finding out what your manager does. 
For someone who didn't prepare for this question, he or she will fall into a trap. 
Let's say a person said he or she was a manager. 
If the interviewer asks this question and the person responds by saying similar types of responsibilities, then something is wrong. 
Why do you have the same responsibilities as your manager? To prepare for this question, make sure you answer that your manager did higher level work than your own. 
The work that you mention you did should be showing off your skills, but your manager should have even greater responsibilities. 
Then it really shows how high you are. 
The example I'm going to give represents me as a Group Program Manager.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I57/sentence/I57S2.mp3">He was a sales manager.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I57/sentence/I57S5.mp3">The title of the person I report to is Product Unit Manager. 
The Product Unit Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire project.

He also is the person representing our whole group and reports progress to the vice president of our organization. 
He provides high level guidance and direction making sure we are following our mission statement. 
Other people who report to him are the Development manager and the Group Program manager.</a>"

The more details you provide the better your answer. 
It ensures you are telling the truth and that you are aware of what you need to be able to do to take the next step up. 
Finally, a great way to answer this question is to know what position you are applying for and then list off the responsibilities of the person you would be reporting to if you got hired. 
That will make the interviewer think that you have very similar or exact experience for the job you are applying for.

<h2>In your previous position, how much time did you spend ...</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I58/sentence/I58S1.mp3">In your previous position, how much time did you spend on the phone?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I58/sentence/I58S2.mp3">In your previous position, how much time did you spend in meetings?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I58/sentence/I58S3.mp3">In your previous position, how much time did you spend working by yourself?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I58/sentence/I58S4.mp3">In your previous position, how much time did you spend working in a team?</a>"</b>

These questions all depend on the type of position you are applying for. 
If the position is a product support position, then time spent on the phone is going to be large. 
Let's say your previous work involved working alone a lot, and the position you are applying for requires a lot of teamwork. 
Even though you worked by yourself a lot, you should emphasize the work you did in teams. 
If this is the situation, then I would say I did a combination of both.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I58/sentence/I58S5.mp3">In my last position, we had large projects that involved multiple people. 
We had meetings to discuss the project and worked in teams whenever it involved overlap of feature. 
After the meetings and working with the team, I was required to finish my work by myself. 
So it was quite balanced between meetings, team work and working by myself.</a>"

This is not an extravagant answer, but it definitely shows that this person is capable of working in groups and working alone. 
Most office work requires a combination of working in groups and alone, but if your situation is different, then answer according to what the interviewer wants to hear.

<h2>If you don't leave your current job, what do you imagine you will be doing in several years?</h2>

There are several things the interviewer wants to learn from this question. 
The interviewer knows you are looking for another job because you are not happy with where you are at. 
Knowing this, they want to find out how you react to situations where you are not happy. 
Most people who do not prepare for this question will have a generic answer that doesn't stand out. 
You can use this opportunity to give a solid answer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I59/sentence/I59S2.mp3">I'm confident I'll be in a management position several years from now. 
In my current position, junior employees ask me many questions and I like to mentor people. 
My work is very routine and I'm very efficient. 
I want to find more challenges my work currently doesn't offer.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I59/sentence/I59S3.mp3">To tell you the truth, I feel I'll be doing the same thing I'm doing now. 
I always look for more work and different opportunities, but my current company doesn't have many opportunities for advancement.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I59/sentence/I59S4.mp3">I'm a very proactive person and I'll continue to do my job well. 
I'll always look for opportunities and even create places where I can improve my work. 
I know if I continue to perform well, I'll have more opportunities to get promoted when a position opens. 
So hopefully, in several years, I'll be managing people that are in my current position now.</a>"

Despite having some negative feelings about work, this answer shows that he or she will continue to do hard work regardless of being unhappy. 
You shouldn't say you are unhappy, but looking for another job is one indication of not being happy.

<h2>If you're very happy with your current job, why do you want to leave?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I60/sentence/I60S1.mp3">If you're very happy with your current job, why do you want to leave?</a>"</b>

If you portray that you are very happy with your current job, then they might ask you this question. 
I was in a very similar situation and I will include my answer as the example. 
You can use other reasons, but make sure it doesn't contradict you being happy.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I60/sentence/I60S5.mp3">I have been with my previous group for more than three years. 
I was doing the same thing on a regular basis.

So I had a desire to gain new experiences and learn from different products. 
I believe having a variety of experience is good for my career so I made the decision to leave my current job.</a>"

This is simple and direct. 
It answers the question without including unnecessary excuses. 
It also shows my desire to grow, learn more, and improve myself. 
This is a good indication of a good employee so using an answer like mine is a safe answer.

<h2>If you have problems or complaints with your current job, why haven't you brought it to their attention?</h2>

If the interviewer knows you have complaints about your current job, then they might ask you this question. 
Make sure the complaints are things that do not make you look bad. 
For example, having no opportunities is a good complaint, but not getting a good raise is a bad complaint. 
After you decide on the complaint, then you can create your answer around it. 
It is better to answer that you did bring this up multiple times. 
That way, you are displayed as honest.

I spoke with my manager for more work so I can grow and gain more experience, but unfortunately, there isn't any work to give. 
I even had a discussion about changing roles, but because there is no open headcount in other divisions, it was hard to do that. 
So I definitely conveyed my desire for more work or for change, but it was something they couldn't provide.</a>"

Having an employee that complains about a lot of things is an employee you do not want to hire. 
However, if an employee complains about not having enough work, it could be seen as a good complaint. 
Most work places have more work than resources, so giving more work isn't a problem. 
So this complaint shows that you are a person who wants to work and wants to learn. 
These are good traits and that makes this answer a good one.

These are very similar to the 'Tell me about' type of questions. 
They want a specific example from your work experience. 
But if the position is an engineer position, you will not get questions about revenue and cost, but you might get one about efficiency. 
In other questions, I gave an example of reducing cost, so I will use this time to give an example of increasing revenue.

All examples will be different because everyone has different experiences. 
When you think of your own, you should primarily be concerned about how clear you are. 
Think of something you did and put them into words.

<h2>What do you feel an employer owes an employee?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I63/sentence/I63S1.mp3">What do you feel an employer owes an employee?</a>"</b>

This purpose for this question is basically to see what you expect from the company. 
It is a simple answer, but you should also mention what you will give, in return for what you are expecting.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I63/sentence/I63S2.mp3">I believe an employer should provide a good work environment and opportunities for growth in return for hard work.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I63/sentence/I63S5.mp3">I have a lot of expectations from my employer. 
Financial compensation is a given, but there are other things I expect. 
I feel an employer should provide a good work environment, opportunities for growth, reward and recognition for excellence, and guidance in career development. 
I know I will be giving everything I can to help my employer succeed, and in return these are some of the expectations I have.</a>"

If you look at the list of things I mentioned, all of them are strong indicators of a good employee. 
If a person is wanting to grow and guidance in career development, then that worker is serious about improving him or herself. 
Also, wanting reward and recognition for excellence indicates that this person is going to try to achieve excellence to get the reward. 
I would try to avoid saying things like, having a good sick day policy, or an understanding of missed days due to miscellaneous issues, or mentioning a good maternity leave plan. 
These things are all provided by large companies, but mentioning them indicates that you are a person who gets sick easily, or a person planning on having a baby, or an unlucky person that misses work due to bad luck.

Unless you have a better answer, the best answer for this question is a yes. 
However, you should clearly state that you want to learn everything and eventually move into a similar position. 
Do not sound like you are a person who is going to steal the job, but rather someone who is going to work hard to earn the position.

I feel this question is not to quiz you about your knowledge about the company. 
It also doesn't test if you researched this company or not. 
I feel that this question is to find out what you know before they explain some things about there company. 
You should understand that if you are a strong candidate and you are doing well on your interview, then they will start sharing some things about the company to entice you to take the position. 
However, it could turn out to be a quiz so make sure you do your research before interviewing for a position.

You don't have to list everything you know... just enough to let them know that you did your homework. 
Also, take a little time to give the company a compliment such as the last sentence. 
It is a psychological tool that you should use to your advantage. 
This type of compliment is directed at the company and the interviewer will be happy to hear this.

<h2>What do you know about our product?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I67/sentence/I67S1.mp3">What do you know about our product?</a>"

This is another type of question they ask to find out what you know so they don't tell you something that you already know. 
If it is an existing product, then you should definitely know what it is. 
If not, and after you researched as much as you could, tell them the little that you know. 
For example, I interviewed for a group within Microsoft that was very new. 
I had no idea what the team was creating but I was interested because it was a new technology. 
I found out as much as I could and when they asked me this question, this is how I answer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I67/sentence/I67S3.mp3">There isn't much information about your products yet, but I heard you are creating new technology to create a more secure database.

I didn't know much, but after researching, this is all I could find. 
This is exactly what I said and they responded by telling me more detail. 
It wasn't wrong, but at least I said enough about the group to sound like I researched a little bit. 
That's basically all you have to do for this question.

<h2>Have you managed people in any of the positions you've held?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I68/sentence/I68S1.mp3">Have you managed people in any of the positions you've held?</a>"</b>

If your resume states that you are a manager or states that you manage people, then they won't ask you this question. 
It is for those that are not in a defined management position. 
Basically, they want to know if you have any experience managing people. 
I do not recommend lying. 
They can keep asking questions until they find you in a lie. 
I would recommend telling the truth. 
I'll give two examples. 
One is my experience of managing two temporary workers. 
And another is an example that would show some managing experience without actually saying you managed people.

I met with them on a regular basis and provided feedback on where they are doing well, and where they needed improvement. 
Their time in our team ended after we completed the project. 
It wasn't a management position, but I gained experience in managing people.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I68/sentence/I68S7.mp3">I never held a position where I was managing people, but I had a lot of experience where I was in charge of large projects.

If you have management experience, then you can tell them about your experience. 
But if you haven't, then it might be good to show them that you have some experience in managing people as I illustrate in my example.

<h2>What types of people do you have trouble getting along with?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I69/sentence/I69S1.mp3">What types of people do you have trouble getting along with?</a>"</b>

Even if you believe you get along with everyone, the interviewer will not believe you so don't say that you do. 
I recommend thinking about a type of person that is a bad worker. 
Use that person as an example and then explain what you do to put effort into the troubled relationship.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I69/sentence/I69S2.mp3">I get along with almost everybody, but I tend to get frustrated at people who always say yes and end up not delivering.

<b>Long Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I69/sentence/I69S4.mp3">I get along with almost everyone, but I think I have the hardest time tolerating people who think they're always right. 
Not everything is black and white and many times there are multiple ways of doing something. 
In my last group, I had a coworker that believed his way was the correct way. 
That's fine, but when you try to explain another view point, he doesn't listen, starts to talk louder and he begins to think it's a debate. 
I avoided him for a while, but realized I should put in an effort to deal with his personality.</a>"

For a follow up question, the interviewer can ask you what you did in this situation. 
Here is an example of dealing with this type of person.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I69/sentence/I69S5.mp3">Basically, I had to change the way I talked to him. 
I was very careful with my words and always said something like, 'that's a great idea, but could we add this to it' or 'I definitely agree with you, but can I get your opinion on this method.' To tell you the truth, I would rather not deal with a person like that, but I thought the right thing to do was find a way to deal with him so that is what I did.</a>"

The reason why it is acceptable to say you have a difficult time dealing with people like this is because everyone will have a hard time dealing with this type of person. 
So it doesn't make you look bad because you can't get along with this person, however, this is a good answer because it shows taking initiative to correct the relationship.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I70/sentence/I70S1.mp3">Who do you think are our two major competitors?</a>"</b>

I never received this question, but it is very likely if it is important to know competitors. 
Make sure during your research, you also investigate the competitors of the company you are interviewing for. 
You can make your answer if you know more details such as market percentage of each company, or if it is a product company, what products they make. 
For the long answer, I'll give an example of a person interviewing for a marketing position for McDonalds. 
This is a good example, because one of the competitors is obvious. 
It is Burger King. 
But what is the second competitor. 
That is the significance of this example. 
It gives you an opportunity to explain your opinion of the second competitor. 
But the figures I'm giving for all the answers are fake. 
You should make sure you research numbers so you can use them in your answers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I70/sentence/I70S5.mp3">The biggest competitor is Burger King. 
Where ever you see a McDonalds, it's common to see Burger King near by. 
They specialize in flame broiled burgers and use that as their marketing strategy. 
The Whopper is their number one selling burger selling approximately 30% more than all their other burgers. 
The second competitor is Wendy's. 
Although in some regions other hamburger stores sell more, if you take international sales into consideration, Wendy's clearly is a strong competitor. 
They advertise opening late and concentrate on their dollar menu luring people in to buy other more expensive items.</a>"

This example clearly demonstrates knowledge about the industry instead of just McDonalds. 
Knowing the industry is important because and this question gives you the opportunity to show that off. 
This example also demonstrates an understanding of the international aspect of selling burgers. 
Finally, their marketing strategy is included in the answer. 
When you are interviewing for a position, make sure you know as much detail as you can to show that you are knowledgeable about the whole industry.

<h2>Why do you like sales?</h2>

I do not have much sales experience but I would answer this question by thinking of salesman I encountered in the past that I felt was good. 
Think about your experience with sales people and list what they did. 
For example, they probably follow a format. 
First, they explain what the product is. 
Then they tell you the functionalities and where you can use it. 
Third, they should tell you how much easier it will make your work. 
Fourth, it should have a good warranty.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I72/sentence/I72S5.mp3">We are proud to carry this stapler. 
It's very durable and easy to use. 
Loading the staples is as simple as clicking this button on the bottom to open the top. 
The design is made with more curves to make it more appealing on the desk. 
It also is designed with more safety in mind. 
If you accidentally drop the staple on your foot or hit it with your hand, the curves are smooth enough where it will not break the skin. 
The warranty on the stapler is great too. 
It comes with a five year guarantee. 
We are currently offering this stapler for a low price of $19.99, and we have a low price guarantee. 
If you find a lower price in the next thirty days, we will gladly pay you the difference.</a>"

If you are applying for a sales position, you have to be ready to be able to sell anything in the room. 
I would recommend thinking about an outline. 
Get that in your head. 
Then use the outline to practice selling variety of things. 
You can use my answer as an outline covering features, functionality, safety, design, warranty, and price. 
But don't limit it to just these, if you have another idea, add it to this, or make up your own.

<h2>How long have you been looking for a job?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I73/sentence/I73S1.mp3">How long have you been looking for a job?</a>"</b>

I don't know if this is legitimate question for an interviewer to ask, but it is definitely possible. 
I don't like the question, but at least we should think about it and prepare an answer. 
If you have been looking for a job for like eight months, it could sound like you are a bad candidate because nobody wants to hire you. 
Instead, I would take a different approach than answering honestly. 
If the resume shows you have been out of work for a year, then you have to explain the one year. 
You have two options. 
First, you can be honest and say you have been looking for one year, or you can think of a good excuse. 
It's hard to lie and sound believable so I'm going to give an honest answer. 
If you have a good excuse for not working for a long duration, feel free to use that as an excuse.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I73/sentence/I73S5.mp3">To be honest, I've been looking for a job for quite a long time. 
The job market hasn't been that great and it's been a little rough.

I definitely learned a lot and I'm really ready to start working again.</a>"

If you have a real excuse such as a sick mother you have to take care of, here is an example.

I don't recommend lying for this question. 
It could turn bad if they find out the truth later. 
Telling them the truth like my first example shows honesty and shows that you tried to stay productive.

<h2>Why haven't you received any offers so far?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S1.mp3">Why haven't you received any offers so far?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S2.mp3">What offers have you received so far?</a>"</b>

This is another type of question that most interviewers will not ask. 
But just in case, I'll provide an example. 
For the question asking what offers have you received so far, you can simply list the ones you have received without details. 
For example, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S3.mp3">I received offers from Boeing and InfoSpace.</a>" But if they ask you why haven't you received any offers, then your answer will depend on if you have an offer or not. 
If you do, then you can politely correct them by saying, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S4.mp3">Actually, I received an offer from Intel. 
But I didn't respond with my answer yet because this company is my first choice.</a>" If you do not have any offers, then you can say something like this example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S5.mp3">I just started interviewing this past week, so it's a little too early to tell.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S6.mp3">I recently started looking for a job, but I'm hoping that I'll receive offers soon.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S7.mp3">I received one offer from a smaller company, but I want to see what else is out there. 
I like what this company has to offer so I'm hoping everything turns out well today.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S8.mp3">I've only interviewed with two other companies so far and I have a second interview with one of them. 
It's too early to tell if I'll be receiving any offers right now, but I'm confident that I will get a couple.</a>"

This answer is suggesting that you are actively interviewing. 
Mentioning a second interview with another company also shows that you passed the first interview stage. 
You are not admitting to any fault by not receiving any offers, but simply saying it is too early because you haven't been searching for a job that long.

If you have been looking for a job for a long time, then you will not be able to use an answer like I just showed. 
Instead, you might have to be honest and try to put the blame somewhere else. 
More likely you will not receive this answer, but just in case, here is one more example. 
This example admits directly to not receiving any offers but shows diligence and shows that this person doesn't give up.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I74/sentence/I74S9.mp3">Most of the jobs I have been applying for require more experience than I have. 
Also, because the job market is rough right now the competition has been pretty tough. 
But I plan on self studying continually and I know through my diligence that I will get a job soon.</a>"

This question is seeing how you react to ambiguous situations. 
Also it checks to see how resourceful you are. 
The best way to answer this question is to provide step by step actions you would take in this situation.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I75/sentence/I75S2.mp3">I would investigate the assignment deeper by searching for more information, asking coworkers or other managers and make the smartest decision on how to tackle the assignment.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I75/sentence/I75S5.mp3">First, I would read the assignment again thoroughly to see if I missed a clue or anything. 
I could even turn to the Internet and look up other documentation if it was something like a difficult process I didn't know. 
After investigating this assignment, and I still don't understand it, then I could turn to my peers and see if anyone has done an assignment similar to the one I received. 
If my peers do not know either, then I could ask my boss's manager and verify with him. 
After exhausting these options, then I would have to make a decision on how to do the assignment and make the best decision I can on how to tackle the assignment. 
Before engaging in the assignment, I would leave a message on my boss's cell phone.</a>"

There might be a better answer, but in my experience many interviewers are looking for a process of reaching a goal. 
In this example, it shows each step from beginning to end. 
Feel free to add or change these steps after thinking about it.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I76/sentence/I76S2.mp3">In this situation, I'll have to ramp up quickly and study notes from previous meetings before attending any.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I76/sentence/I76S5.mp3">Even if everyone is a veteran, I feel confident I can fit right in. 
I would prepare as much as I can by reading existing material to catch up on the project.

I would also create a list of ideas through the documents I have read.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I77/sentence/I77S2.mp3">I have experience in learning new concepts without training. 
I usually look through books or manuals to find answers.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I77/sentence/I77S3.mp3">I have experience in this area so I won't need much training.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I77/sentence/I77S5.mp3">If the company provides training, I'll utilize the training to learn. 
If not, then I'll learn by being attentive to what other people do, read up on the documentation, and be willing to ask questions when necessary. 
I know the first couple of weeks are important and I'm willing to put in extra effort to start off on the right track.</a>"

This example is shorter and more to the point. 
It is not an answer that will astonish the interviewer, but it is an answer that will show couple good traits about yourself.

<h2>If your supervisor tells you to do something that you believe can be done in a different way, what would you do?</h2>

This question is designed to see how you would react to your manager when you disagree. 
It is important to trust your manager, but at the same time, not follow blindly. 
That means I should ask questions to clarify, make suggestions, and after a discussion, follow the instructions of your manager. 
This is the steps I would take to answer this question.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I78/sentence/I78S2.mp3">I will tell my supervisor of an alternate way and explain the benefits. 
If my supervisor is not convinced, then I'll follow his instructions.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I78/sentence/I78S3.mp3">I'll suggest a different way of doing the assignment along with the benefits.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I78/sentence/I78S4.mp3">I'll suggest a different method and ask my supervisor if I can do this work the new way. 
If the result will be the same but would potentially save more time, then I believe my manager will allow it.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I78/sentence/I78S5.mp3">I would question my supervisor why he or she wants it done this particular way. 
If I still don't agree with the method, I would suggest alternate ways of tackling the assignment and explain how my suggestion would be better. 
After having a good conversation, if we still can't see eye to eye, then I would have to trust my superior and follow his or her instructions.</a>"

This is a solid answer because it is showing independence by having my own suggestion and thought, it shows I can think for myself, and finally, shows that I would be an employee that trusts the supervisor. 
Ultimately, this answer shows that I'm a smart person willing to make adjustments. 
I'll take a moment here to clarify something. 
How does this answer show that I'm smart and a person willing to make adjustments? Well, many times, the interviewer will not see exactly what you want them to see. 
However, even if they don't see all your good intentions, they will at least get a good feeling about you through your solid answers.

I would rather question my manager to verify if it is illegal or not. 
If I'm not convinced through facts, then I would investigate through other means.

Resources of this incident.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I79/sentence/I79S5.mp3">If I'm not sure, I would verify whether it's legal or illegal before performing the task. 
If I find it is legal, then I would continue with the task. 
If not, then I would report the request to the boss of the person who asked me to do it. 
If the boss does not take appropriate action, I would find out why and report the incident to Human Resources myself.</a>"

This is making you sound firm and stubborn. 
But in this situation, you have to be bold with your answer. 
You cannot let them think that you would hide the fact. 
This is especially true if you are interviewing for a finance or accounting position that deals with money or other important information.

This is the hardest question I have to answer here. 
Being unfairly criticized is one of my biggest pet peeves. 
I hate it when it happens and I usually blow up. 
I get mad and start to argue. 
But as you know, this is a bad answer to this question. 
They are asking you this question because they want to see if you will react professionally.

I would try to understand their point of view and explain my point of view. 
If I was unfairly criticized in public, then I would be a little upset but I would wait to address the problem until the person criticizing me was alone. 
I would do this because if I'm upset, I wouldn't want to start an argument without thinking. 
So after some time, I would approach the person and ask him or her why I was criticized. 
If it was justified, then I would use that as constructive criticism to improve myself. 
If not, then I would tell that person that it isn't good to publicly criticize someone when they are not sure if it is correct.</a>"

This is a professional answer, but it could sound like you are a weak person.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I83/sentence/I83S4.mp3">I don't mind doing boring and tedious work. 
As long as I don't have to do it for a long duration such as six months, then I really wouldn't have a problem.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I83/sentence/I83S5.mp3">I trust that management knows what is best for the project. 
Whatever work I'm given, I'm going to do my best knowing that it's helping the entire company. 
I'm more oriented towards the success of the company and I'll do whatever it takes to help out. 
So I wouldn't mind doing boring and tedious work for awhile.</a>"

This answer is showing loyalty and being able to sacrifice personal interest for the success of the company. 
Maybe it was this question that helped me pass my third interview.

<h2>How long do you plan on staying with this company?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I84/sentence/I84S1.mp3">How long do you plan on staying with this company?</a>"</b>

This question is usually asked to the people who move between jobs frequently. 
They do not want to hire someone who will leave after several months. 
The hiring process costs the company money and time and they want to hire someone who is looking to stay for awhile. 
I recommend saying you want to stay for a long time.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I84/sentence/I84S2.mp3">To tell you the truth, I have been working and gaining experience to get into this company. 
This is where I want to be and I plan on staying a long time if I'm offered the job.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I84/sentence/I84S3.mp3">The only time I get bored is if there is no work to do. 
As long as there's a lot of work, then I'll be happy and stay a long time. 
I'm a busy body and I need to do work.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I84/sentence/I84S4.mp3">This company has everything I'm looking for. 
It provides the type of work I love, the employees are all happy, and the environment is great. 
I plan on staying a long time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I84/sentence/I84S5.mp3">One of my goals is to obtain a position in this company. 
I know that once I start working here, it'll be for a long time.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I84/sentence/I84S6.mp3">As far as I can tell, this company has everything I'm looking for. 
I enjoy this type of work and the benefits at this company are great. 
I'm looking for a long term position and if there are opportunities for advancement and growth here, then I want to stay for a long time.</a>"

This is another question you can answer in a short way. 
You don't want to answer with a single line answer because it doesn't sound believable. 
So a couple of sentences explaining what you want will convince them that you want to stay for a long time.

<h2>How do you explain the fact that you frequently change jobs?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I85/sentence/I85S1.mp3">How do you explain the fact that you frequently change jobs? I see that you haven't stayed with a company for more than 2 years.</a>"</b>

To pass this question, you have to convince them that you are going to stick around. 
This isn't a question to see what you know or what your philosophy is, it is a concern they have that you have to address. 
Your persuasion skill will be required for this answer. 
But if you can't be persuasive, convince them through step by step facts that leads to the fact that you are going to stay with this company if they hire you.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I85/sentence/I85S2.mp3">I have been gaining experience and knowledge to have the minimum requirements to work for this company. 
My goal is to work for this company, and I'll be working here a long time because this is where I want to be.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I85/sentence/I85S3.mp3">I planned on staying with my current job for a longer time period, but when this position opened up, I really wanted to apply because this company has everything I need.

I plan on staying a long time.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I85/sentence/I85S4.mp3">I want to work for a large company that has many opportunities. 
I didn't receive this in my other companies because they were smaller, but I learned this company has a lot of great work to do and a lot of different opportunities.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I85/sentence/I85S5.mp3">To tell you the truth, early in my career, I didn't know what I wanted to do. 
I've been in a couple different industries, and it wasn't until my last position that I found exactly what I wanted to be doing. 
I stayed with my previous company for more than a year but there weren't enough opportunities. 
I finally found what I love to do and now I want to find a company where I can be a part of the company instead of a worker that has no interest in the overall company. 
I'm being careful to choose my next job because I want to establish my career in my next job, and after researching, I found that ABC Company can provide everything I'm looking for. 
So I'll definitely be here for the long term.</a>"

This answer is a little long, but if you don't convince them that you are going to stay long, then you have a very little chance of being hired. 
So take whatever time you need to convince them. 
If you think of your own answer, write it down and be able to say it smoothly so they can fully understand that you are serious about staying.

<h2>Tell me about a time you had a big disagreement with your boss.</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I86/sentence/I86S1.mp3">Tell me about a time you had a big disagreement with your boss. 
What did you do and what was the outcome?</a>"</b>

Here is another 'tell me about' question. 
You will have to think of an example of your own. 
The items you need to include in your answer should consist of you showing proper communication, taking appropriate action, and ending with a good outcome. 
It's perfectly natural to disagree with your boss. 
It is important how you react when you have a disagreement. 
Show the interviewer that you are professional about disagreements.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I86/sentence/I86S2.mp3">I never really had a big disagreement with my manager. 
The only thing I can think of was when I recently got back from a business trip, my manager told me I had to go on another one the next day. 
In my previous company, it wasn't common to send someone on a business trip immediately, but another employee got sick so I had to fill in.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I86/sentence/I86S3.mp3">I had a disagreement with my boss on how to do an assignment. 
It was easy to resolve by having a discussion on the pro's and con's of both methods. 
We didn't come to any conclusion which way was better, and I ended up performing the work the way my manager wanted. 
This was because in case I couldn't finish the assignment, he could easily pick up where I left off.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I86/sentence/I86S4.mp3">I don't think I've had a large disagreement with my boss before, but I do remember a small disagreement. 
I received an email from my boss telling me that he wants me to stop the work I was doing on my project and give it to a co-worker. 
He wanted me to start on a new project immediately. 
I spent two and a half weeks on this project and I only had three days left. 
I really wanted to finish this and it didn't make sense for me to hand this project off to someone else. 
So I put some thought into it, went over to my boss's office, and asked him why this project couldn't wait three days. 
He made his argument and I still didn't agree. 
We discussed this for a while and we compromised by having someone help me finish the project I was working on so I can have some time to kick start the next project. 
That's the only experience I had with a disagreement, but I learned that it only takes simple dialog and a little compromise to overcome a disagreement.</a>"

I know this answer is long, but all types of 'tell me about' questions are long. 
You have to tell a story in the shortest way for them to understand while explaining the disagreement along with the outcome. 
It's a huge question and it will take a long time to master 'tell me about' questions. 
That is why you should diligent on these types of questions.

<h2>What do you do when there is no work to do?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I87/sentence/I87S1.mp3">What do you do when there is no work to do?</a>"</b>

The interviewer wants to find out what type of person you are. 
Are you a busy body looking for work, or are you a lazy person doing only the work that they tell you to do? This question will determine just that so make sure you give them an answer showing your great work habits.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I87/sentence/I87S2.mp3">I always try to be productive even if there isn't much work to do.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I87/sentence/I87S3.mp3">Usually when I have nothing to do, I ask my manager if any of my peers need help.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I87/sentence/I87S6.mp3">I'm a type of person who hates not having work to do. 
In my last position, I frequently asked my supervisor for more work when I finished early.

So I believe there never is a time when there is no work to do.</a>"

Would you want a person like this? I think most companies will love an employee who wants to continually work. 
So the example is the type of answer you should give.

<h2>What do you do when there are too many things to do?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I88/sentence/I88S1.mp3">What do you do when there are too many things to do?</a>"</b>

When someone is busy, it is important to take some time to organize and prioritize the work. 
Many people just try to work faster, but that doesn't really help. 
Planning and working smarter is the best answer when times get busy.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I88/sentence/I88S2.mp3">I usually plan, organize, prioritize and then work real hard. 
I always keep my cool and work on one item after another. 
I found that this is efficient instead of worrying about how much work there is to do.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I88/sentence/I88S3.mp3">I really like it when there is so much work. 
I'm a fast and efficient worker and I like taking challenges that are big.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I88/sentence/I88S4.mp3">I regain my composure, take a deep breath, and work diligently.

A lot can get accomplished by working diligently. 
In a situation where there are many things to do, I'll reprioritize my work, plan and organize as much as I can and work hard.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I88/sentence/I88S6.mp3">For me, the busier it gets, the more I organize and plan. 
Some people might think I could use the time I spend in planning out my day to work on something, but I realized how efficient I can work when I organize my work ahead of time and plan out my day thoroughly. 
Also, it prevents me from panicking or from blowing up from the pressure. 
I learned from my previous manager that when there are many things to do, you should work smarter instead of faster.</a>"

You can answer by saying that you will work harder or work faster or even work overtime, but people with experience knows that working smarter by planning and organizing comes from experience. 
So even if you don't have much experience, this type of answer can make you look like you have been in this type of position many times and overcame them.

<h2>What do you do when you feel burned out?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I89/sentence/I89S1.mp3">What do you do when you feel burned out?</a>"</b>

If you never burn out, then you are either superman or you don't work that hard. 
It is ok to admit to burning out at times, and you should provide an answer that shows how you deal with the times when you do get burned out.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I89/sentence/I89S2.mp3">I think it's important to anticipate being burned out before it happens. 
But if a deadline requires me to work so much that I end up being burned out, I try to relax myself and get reenergized by not thinking about work at home and watching a good movie.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I89/sentence/I89S3.mp3">When I feel burned out, I go to the gym and work out. 
This actually helps me because it moves the focus from my mind to my body. 
After a good work out, I really feel mentally rejuvenated.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I89/sentence/I89S4.mp3">I usually use the weekends to engage in my personal hobbies to prevent me from burning out. 
I like to play tennis and golf, and these activities keep me mentally energized to work hard in the office.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I89/sentence/I89S5.mp3">I try to prevent burning out by maintaining a healthy balanced life. 
I try to engage in personal hobbies outside of work such as playing the guitar or going for a hike. 
They keep me energized to work hard in the office. 
But if I do feel burned out, I like to rent a movie and relax for the night.</a>"

As you can tell, this is an easy answer. 
Many times a person who constantly works without a break can eventually become a bad employee by burning out. 
Being able to communicate exactly what you do during burnouts or how to prevent them indicates that you have balance. 
So simply listing a couple of hobbies and adding, 'keeps me energized to work hard in the office' is a good enough answer that the interviewer will accept.

<h2>How do you balance both your family and your job?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I90/sentence/I90S1.mp3">How do you manage having so many things to do such as work, family, and school?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I90/sentence/I90S2.mp3">How do you balance both your family and your job?</a>"</b>

This is another easy answer where you can show your willingness to work hard. 
But it is unlikely you will get this question. 
Most of the time, the interviewer will ask this during small talk. 
When interviewing in America, I noticed there are many times where small talk is important. 
For example, walking together to the office could take two minutes. 
Are you going to say nothing during those two minutes? What if the interviewer asks how your day is going? He or she is basically initiating small talk. 
So it is definitely possible you will engage in small talk, and you should definitely practice small talk.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I90/sentence/I90S3.mp3">With my kids in school, it's really easy to manage my time. 
I have the full day to myself and I want to be productive by helping a company grow.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I90/sentence/I90S4.mp3">I'm very organized and I plan everything I do. 
This helps me to easily find a balance between family and work.</a>" 

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I90/sentence/I90S5.mp3">Well, during the day while my kids are in school, I like to work. 
And in the evenings we spend time together doing homework. 
I really enjoy being busy and managing multiple things in my life.</a>"

This is a short answer that shows the ability of multi-tasking. 
Also, a person who enjoys being busy is a good sign. 
So even if you receive questions during small talk, make sure to give answers that show good traits.

<h2>You've been with one company your entire career. 
Don't you think you will have a tough time adjusting to a new environment?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I91/sentence/I91S1.mp3">You've been with one company your entire career. 
Don't you think you will have a tough time adjusting to a new environment?</a>"</b>

If this is the case and you have been with only one company your entire career, then the best way to answer this question is to say how many changes you experienced in your previous position. 
Then it will sound like you are good with change and can adapt to new situations easily.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I91/sentence/I91S2.mp3">In my company, my projects changed very frequently and I was required to ramp up on new technologies. 
I'm also very friendly and like to meet new people. 
So I think I'll have an easy time adjusting to a new environment.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I91/sentence/I91S3.mp3">I actually like being in new environments.

I learned that this company is very diverse and has a great office environment. 
I feel I'll blend right in and make solid contributions to this company.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I91/sentence/I91S5.mp3">Although I've been with one company, I have experienced many changes and new roles in my career. 
For example, during the middle of a long project, the vice president sent out a group wide mail completely changing our direction. 
We had to basically start from scratch with half the time left. 
It felt like I was a new employee again having to ramp up on new technology, reading up on instructional documentation, and learn new applications. 
So through my experience dealing with change and adjusting to new projects, I am confident I will not have a tough time adjusting to this new environment.</a>"

Saying this confidently is the key. 
It's not an important question, but more like a question verifying that you are willing and capable of new things. 
But the more you convince them of your abilities to change, then the better you will appear.

<h2>What have you heard about our company that you didn't like?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I92/sentence/I92S1.mp3">What have you heard about our company that you didn't like?</a>"</b>

This is an unusual question but just in case you will need an answer. 
After researching and you find out that everything is good, you can basically say that you couldn't find anything wrong. 
Try to mix in humor if you can since this is an odd question. 
Also, take a moment to pretend to be thinking about the question before answering immediately.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I92/sentence/I92S2.mp3">From my research, I didn't find anything I disliked. 
This company provides great benefits, works on exciting products, and is listed in the top 100 companies to work for.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I92/sentence/I92S3.mp3">When I search for a job, I always look for negative things. 
However, I didn't find anything that I didn't like.

I didn't hear anything negative about ABC Company. 
Is there something I should know before working here?</a>"

The last sentence in the answer is a question you should say with a slight smile. 
That should lighten the tension a little and show that you are fully confident.

<h2>Do you want to work for a small or large company and why?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I93/sentence/I93S1.mp3">Do you want to work for a small or large company and why?</a>"</b>

This all depends on what size company you are interviewing for. 
Usually, large companies will not ask this question. 
But if they do, make sure you mention you want to work for a large company because of the resources, the training, and other things you can think of. 
More likely, a smaller company will ask you this wondering why you would choose a small company. 
The best way to answer this question is to first think about what a small company can provide over a big company. 
The most significant advantage of working for a small company is having the opportunity to work on a variety of tasks.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I93/sentence/I93S2.mp3">I want to work for a large company because there are different opportunities within the company. 
I also feel a larger company provides better training. 
Finally, a larger company already has key processes in place to provide employees tools to work efficiently.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I93/sentence/I93S3.mp3">I worked for a small company for a year and missed out on a lot of benefits a larger company provides such as training, structured work environment, and a wider variety of work. 
So I want to work for a large company.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I93/sentence/I93S4.mp3">I want to work for a small company because I feel I'll have more opportunities to gain valuable experience. 
I know some friends in large companies and they have specific roles that limit what they're capable of doing. 
I'm hoping that a small company will have more variety and challenges for each employee.</a>"

This is pretty short but to the point. 
It displays wanting to learn and an eagerness to try a variety of things.

Sometimes I try to focus so hard that I miss a point that would help me solve the problem.

I find that this helps me at times.

I believe in using all the resources around me and I think co-workers should use me as a resource as well.</a>"

It's important to let my directs know where I stand so they don't have to make assumptions.</a>"

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I95/sentence/I95S5.mp3">Because I'm the manager, I feel it's my responsibility to improve the relationship. 
If the problem is work related, I'll narrow the problem down whether it's with his working style or another type of problem and assist in anyway I can. 
This would also involve providing feedback and suggestions on how to approach problems. 
But if our personality's conflict then I would try to be more understanding.</a>"

<h2>What do you do when you have a problem with your boss?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I96/sentence/I96S1.mp3">What do you do when you have a problem with your boss?</a>"</b>

This question is a little easier for me because I haven't had many directs I didn't like. 
It is easier to tell a manager your problems because they are in a position where they should accept listening to your problems. 
So in this case, I would answer it by showing some honesty trait.

<h2>What do you do when you have a problem with a co-worker?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I98/sentence/I98S1.mp3">What do you do when you have a problem with a co-worker?</a>"</b>

Usually when two co-workers have a problem, then they will just hate each other and try to be better than the other. 
You can't say this because it is the wrong way to handle it. 
I would probably not deal with the problem and hate the other person, but that is not what I would say in an interview. 
You can mention that you believe having to deal with a problem with a co-worker is difficult because competitiveness comes into factor. 
Along with this statement, follow up with how you would try to look beyond that to make your relationship better.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I98/sentence/I98S5.mp3">Well it all depends on if it's a personality conflict or an issue that is causing the problem. 
An issue is easy to deal with. 
I think I'd go and talk with the co-worker saying something like, 'If you have some time, I think it will be good for us if we talk about this issue.' Starting a conversation to deal with the problem with a co-worker is the hardest step, and if it's done properly, then the issue can easily be resolved. 
If it is a personality issue, then I would try to be more understanding and at worst deal with the problem by anticipating conflicts ahead of time to put myself in a position to either avoid it or to make it less of a problem.</a>"

This is showing answers by using scenarios. 
It is a solid answer but if you disagree, feel free to think of a good scenario that will fit you better.

<h2>How do you handle conflict?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I99/sentence/I99S1.mp3">How do you handle conflict?</a>"</b>

This is a general question. 
It doesn't ask if you are the one with the conflict, if it is a conflict with another person, if it is a conflict of schedule, or if it is a conflict with changes at work. 
If you want, you can ask a question to clarify. 
But if you want to answer in a general way, try to think of an answer that will work for all types of conflict.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I99/sentence/I99S2.mp3">I treat most conflicts the same. 
I analyze the conflict and create a list of steps I can take to resolve it.

<b>Long Answer</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I99/sentence/I99S5.mp3">Whenever I have a conflict I have to deal with, I like to follow a simple process. 
I first identify the problem causing the conflict, think about solutions or ideas that will solve the problem, and then try to implement a solution. 
Although it's very simple, it makes sure that I'm not panicking, losing my temper or losing control of the situation. 
And it prevents me from rushing into a decision that might make the problem worse.</a>"

This is an answer that could be applied to all types of conflicts. 
It doesn't state the exact situations of each conflict, but it does state why following a process is good. 
The interviewer will not think this is an original idea. 
However, the answer provides reasons why it helps. 
These reasons are the key to the answer and it shows that you are organized and in control. 
This answer, without the last sentence is just mediocre. 
But the last sentence makes is very strong.

<h2>Have you fired anyone?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I100/sentence/I100S1.mp3">Have you fired anyone? And if so, why?</a>"</b>

If you fired someone before, then that means you are a manager or hire. 
If your answer is no, then this is an easy question. 
But if you answer yes, then you have to give a reason why. 
If you say I fired one of our employees because he or she couldn't do the work properly, then this is a regular answer that will not help you. 
Large corporations have a procedure they follow to fire someone. 
If you can incorporate using the process of firing into your own experience, then the answer will be stronger. 
Here is an example.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I100/sentence/I100S2.mp3">I've never had to fire anyone yet, but if I'm in this situation, I would follow company policy and do it professionally.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I100/sentence/I100S3.mp3">I had to fire one employee who continually failed to complete projects. 
Before firing this employee, I tried to work with him by motivating, encouraging, and even providing different work.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I100/sentence/I100S4.mp3">The only time I had to fire someone was when an employee was continually late. 
We have a company policy of giving a verbal warning for the first three offenses, and then a written warning after the 3rd offense. 
I had many discussions about this problem with this employee, but it didn't help. 
In the end, we had to let him go.</a>"

<b>Long Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I100/sentence/I100S5.mp3">When I was a managing a group of 4 people in my last position, I unfortunately had to fire one of them. 
The person was unable to perform at an acceptable level for a long period of time. 
Our company has a process in place of trying to grow our employees, empower them, and help them find their strengths, but nothing helped. 
I put the person on probation and explained that he will have to try harder. 
But after seeing bad performance due to a lack of effort for a long time, I had to fire him.</a>"

Another approach to this question is to take a strong stance on performance. 
As I said before, if the answer is different and creative, the interviewer will remember it more and that means they will remember you more. 
Then your chances of getting the job increase more than others. 
Here is an example of an answer that the interviewer will remember.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I100/sentence/I100S6.mp3">Oh yeah, I fired a lot of people. 
All of the reasons were the same. 
They were not performing their jobs. 
I believe in good management. 
I believe I should mentor and help grow our employees. 
This is a business and we need to do whatever we can to help our company grow. 
One of the biggest factors on the success of a company is having great employees. 
So I won't hesitate to fire someone that isn't performing their job. 
It leaves more room to bring in someone who will benefit the company.</a>"

This is an answer I would be willing to use. 
But before using this answer, you must first look at the type of person asking this question and determine if he or she will like it. 
If the person is a strong person that shows no emotion, then it might be good. 
But if a person is very friendly, then that person might not like it. 
Even though it is a good answer, a friendly person might not like it because it could indicate that you are a cold person. 
Basically friendly people don't like cold people and if you have to work together, they might not want to work with you. 
So be careful on using this type of answer.

<h2>What do you do when a worker is giving the team more problems than helping?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I101/sentence/I101S1.mp3">What do you do when a worker is giving the team more problems than helping?</a>"</b>

If you have a lot of team work experience, you know that there are a lot of people like this. 
It is a fact that some people actually slow down the work than help the work. 
That is why this is a good question to ask. 
A good employee will know how to handle this situation. 
A bad employee will do all the work themselves. 
Although doing the work is good, it doesn't show that you can deal with different types of people.

<b>Short Answers</b>

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I101/sentence/I101S2.mp3">I follow a process of helping my coworker out in any way I can. 
This can include assistance in their portion of the work or by encouragement.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I101/sentence/I101S3.mp3">If the problem is related to a difficult task that a coworker cannot solve, then I'll get all the team members to help out.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I101/sentence/I101S5.mp3">I've been in this situation a couple of times. 
One time, we organized and distributed easier work to the worker with problems.

It might have been quicker if the rest of the team members did all the work, but I figure helping this person now will benefit us in our next project. 
Although this method doesn't work all the time, I really get excited when it does work. 
Then I know I really helped another person succeed and this in turn helps the company.</a>" 

This answer will also work if you leave out the last two sentences. 
But I included the last two sentences to emphasize that helping other people succeed is really the truth instead of just words. 
If you choose the right way to say something, it sounds much more believable.

This is another good management question. 
The best way to answer this question is with a procedure in mind. 
Basically after you tried everything, then enough is enough. 
But what exactly is everything. 
You can't use everything because that shows you really don't know. 
Instead of the word everything, list out all the steps so the interviewer believes you know what to do in this situation.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I102/sentence/I102S2.mp3">I know enough is enough when I've exhausted all measures to help this employee grow. 
I would do my part by providing encouragement, giving extra instructions, mentoring, and giving different types of work.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I103/sentence/I103S1.mp3">Do you like to work by yourself or with others?</a>"</b>

Even if you have a strong preference to work alone or with others, the best answer is to say both. 
Even if a job is mostly about working alone, there might be some team work involved. 
Most employers want someone who can work well in a team and work well alone.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I103/sentence/I103S2.mp3">That's a tough question... I like the combination of the two.

If they insist on choosing one, then choose the one that is relevant to the job you are interviewing for.

The answers are all going to be the same. 
It's just a matter of how you say it. 
Because there isn't anything exciting to say here, you should show friendly characteristics so it is believable. 
These answers can be short. 
It really doesn't matter how long the answer is but you have to make sure you show your friendliness through your voice.

<h2>Do you have any physical problems that may limit your ability to perform this job?</h2>

The questions and answers in the miscellaneous section are rather short. 
It doesn't fit into a specific category, but they are possible interview questions. 
Most of the questions are more like small talk questions and they are used to get to know you in a personal way. 
It is important to find out the personality of a candidate as well as their abilities, so you will probably be asked some of the questions in the miscellaneous section.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I105/sentence/I105S1.mp3">Do you have any physical problems that may limit your ability to perform this job?</a>"</b>

If it is a construction job, then of course you have to be physically fit. 
But even an administrative job will require some physical abilities. 
For example, an administrative assistant working in a computer company will have to be able to lift a computer. 
Answering this question is pretty straight forward. 
You don't have to impress them with anything special.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I105/sentence/I105S2.mp3">No. 
I believe I'll be able to physically perform all tasks for this position.</a>"

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I106/sentence/I106S1.mp3">What do you do to stay in shape?</a>"</b>

Staying in physical shape also helps the brain function better. 
It really doesn't matter if you are completely in shape or not. 
But being active indicates that you are not a lazy couch potato.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I106/sentence/I106S2.mp3">I like to take long walks with my dog on a regular basis, and I also go on weekly hikes at a trail near my house.</a>"

This is another question where they want to find out some of your hobbies. 
Basically, you can answer this question similar to how you would answer, what are your hobbies.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I107/sentence/I107S2.mp3">When I'm not in the office, I like to play golf, read magazines, and spend time with my wife.</a>"

I also like gardening, so I work on my yard a lot. 
But if I want to relax, I like to watch videos at night.</a>"

Something short and simple is the best answer. 
No need to elaborate on why.

<h2>What's the most recent book you read?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I108/sentence/I108S1.mp3">What's the most recent book you read?</a>"</b>

If you are interviewing for a marketing position, don't say you are reading a book called International Marketing Strategies. 
Rather, answer with a novel such as Michael Crichton books or John Grisham books. 
It is more realistic and shows other interests that you have.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I108/sentence/I108S2.mp3">I just finished <i>The Runaway Jury</i> by John Grisham. 
I find all of his books very entertaining.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I108/sentence/I108S3.mp3">I have a strong interest in World War II, so I was reading a book about Hitler. 
It's quite interesting to see how he grew up and what lead him to his hatred towards the Jews.</a>"

Something simple like this will be good enough.

<h2>What is the most recent movie you saw?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I109/sentence/I109S1.mp3">What is the most recent movie you saw?</a>"</b>

You can either answer by using a similar answer to the recent book question, or you can say that you don't watch movies that much.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I109/sentence/I109S2.mp3">The last movie I saw was The Last Samurai. 
I thought it was great.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I109/sentence/I109S3.mp3">Oh gosh... it's been a while since I've seen a movie. 
I think it was Spider Man. 
I like to spend my time outside, so I don't see movies that often.</a>"

Both of these answers are fine. 
Whether you like to see movies or not, just tell them exactly what you think. 
Your answers will be more natural. 
If you answer these types of questions awkwardly, they might get the impression that you are uncomfortable or that you are not capable of small talk. 
So answer without thinking too much about these questions.

<h2>Did you have any trouble finding this place?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I110/sentence/I110S1.mp3">Did you have any trouble finding this place?</a>"</b>

This question is not an interview question, but a question usually asked by an interviewer right when you see them. 
This is especially common if the building location is hard to find. 
Here is another question you should tell exactly what happened.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I110/sentence/I110S2.mp3">No problem at all. 
I checked for directions on the Internet and found it pretty easily.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I110/sentence/I110S3.mp3">A little bit. 
I didn't realize that there was another building back here, so I drove by a couple times, but that's ok, I eventually found it.</a>"

With the first answer, they will say something like, that's good. 
Then they will move on to other questions. 
If you answer with the second question, they will probably talk a little more about how he or she agrees that this building is hard to find. 
Either answers are acceptable.

<h2>Will working on weekends be a problem?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I111/sentence/I111S1.mp3">Will working on weekends be a problem?</a>"</b>

If the interviewer is asking this question, then this position is probably going to requires some weekend work. 
Maybe it's not a lot, but they want to make sure that if something goes wrong and more work is required, you will be able to work on weekends. 
I recommend answer by saying it will not be a problem. 
If you want to find out how often you will have to work weekends, you can ask it after answering the question.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I111/sentence/I111S2.mp3">It shouldn't be a problem at all. 
I frequently worked on weekends in my other position, especially during tax season. 
How often is weekend work required here on average?</a>"

This answer is stating that it is no problem. 
It also supports the answer by saying I have worked on weekends in my previous group. 
And the last sentence is an example how you can ask them about weekend work.

<h2>How do you feel about overtime?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I112/sentence/I112S1.mp3">How do you feel about overtime?</a>"</b>

If this is an hourly job, then pay is given to employees working extra hours. 
If it is a salary position, most of the time they will not ask this question because they expect you to work overtime. 
But expect this position to have some overtime requirements if the interviewer is asking this question.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I112/sentence/I112S2.mp3">I don't mind working overtime at all. 
I know during busy times people are expected to work more, and I'm flexible with my hours so I won't have a problem.</a>"

<h2>Have you filed for bankruptcy?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I113/sentence/I113S1.mp3">Have you filed for bankruptcy?</a>"</b>

This question is for positions that deal with finance and money. 
You might see this question if you are interviewing for a banker position, a financial analyst position, or a stock broker. 
If money is a factor, then they want someone who is responsible with money. 
Just simply tell them the truth. 
If you have filed for bankruptcy, then you probably shouldn't be applying for this job anyway. 
So I'm going to give only one answer of no.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I113/sentence/I113S2.mp3">No. 
I'm very responsible with money and I have great credit.</a>"

<h2>Do you own or rent your home?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I114/sentence/I114S1.mp3">Do you own or rent your home?</a>"</b>

Renting or owning a home sometimes indicates your financial status. 
Renters are usually people who do not have enough down payment for a house or people with bad credit who cannot get a loan. 
So it is best to have your own home, but if you don't, then give them an answer that shows you are preparing to buy a home.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I114/sentence/I114S2.mp3">I'm currently renting, but I plan on buying my own place next year.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I114/sentence/I114S3.mp3">I'm renting right now, but I'll probably buy a house when I get married.</a>"

If you own your house, then a simple, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I114/sentence/I114S4.mp3">I own my house.</a>" will be a good enough answer.

<h2>Do you have any outside income?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I115/sentence/I115S1.mp3">Do you have any outside income?</a>"</b>

This might be a job interview question, or it could be a question when you are talking to a creditor. 
In either case, you can simply reply with a yes or no. 
If it is a yes, then briefly tell them the other source of income.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I115/sentence/I115S2.mp3">I get paid child support from my ex-husband.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I115/sentence/I115S3.mp3">I have a rental property.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I115/sentence/I115S4.mp3">No. 
I do not.</a>"

<h2>Do you earn any income from investments or hobbies?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I116/sentence/I116S1.mp3">Do you earn any income from investments or hobbies?</a>"</b>

If you are active in the stock market, then you can mention something like that. 
Another income from investment is from your savings account or mutual funds. 
Whatever it is, simply tell them what it is.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I116/sentence/I116S2.mp3">I have a savings account that I earn a little extra income from.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I116/sentence/I116S3.mp3">I have some mutual funds that perform about 8% a year.</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I116/sentence/I116S4.mp3">I have some investments in the stock market.</a>"

<h2>Are you willing to travel?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I117/sentence/I117S1.mp3">Are you able to make frequent business trips?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I117/sentence/I117S2.mp3">Are you willing to travel?</a>"</b>

If they are asking this, then this position probably requires some traveling. 
If you say no, then you probably won't get hired because they want someone who is able to travel. 
But depending on your job, you will already know if it requires traveling or not.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I117/sentence/I117S3.mp3">I know as an auditor that I'll have to make business trips. 
So I'm definitely willing to travel.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I117/sentence/I117S4.mp3">I don't have any problems with traveling.</a>"

<h2>Are you willing to relocate?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I118/sentence/I118S1.mp3">Are you willing to relocate?</a>"</b>

This is a tough question because relocating means moving to a completely new area. 
It might be ok to answer with a no, but I would answer with a maybe. 
Here is an example.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I118/sentence/I118S2.mp3">I guess it would depend on the location and the pay. 
If everything is the same, I would rather stay here because this is where I grew up. 
But I would be willing to consider it.</a>"

This answer is not saying yes or no. 
This is saying maybe in a polite way. 
Don't answer with a direct maybe. 
That is bad. 
Instead use something similar to my example. 
If you are willing to relocate, it is an easy answer.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I118/sentence/I118S3.mp3">I love change and I'd definitely be willing to relocate.</a>"

<h2>May I contact your current employer?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I119/sentence/I119S1.mp3">May I contact your current employer?</a>"</b>

This all depends on if your current employer knows that you are searching for another job. 
If you are not employeed, they might ask if they can contact your former employer. 
Regardless, the best answer is to say yes. 
If not, then they will think you have something to hide.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I119/sentence/I119S2.mp3">Yes. 
Do you have their contact information?</a>"

<h2>May I contact your references?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I120/sentence/I120S1.mp3">May I contact your references?</a>"</b>

The only correct answer to this question is a yes. 
If they have your references, then a simple yes will be enough. 
If they do not, then answer yes and offer them a list.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I120/sentence/I120S2.mp3">Sure. 
After the interview, I can email or fax you a list of references. 
Will that be ok?</a>"

<h2>Is there anything else you want to add?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I121/sentence/I121S1.mp3">Is there anything else I should know?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I121/sentence/I121S2.mp3">Is there anything else you want to add?</a>"</b>

Adding one more sentence to state one more thing never hurts. 
But choose carefully because it is their last impression of you. 
If you felt you didn't show that much enthusiasm, here is your chance. 
Or if you feel that they didn't ask you about one of your strong traits, you have a chance to state it.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I121/sentence/I121S3.mp3">I don't know if I expressed it that well, but I'm very excited about this position. 
I'm confident that I can do very well here.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I121/sentence/I121S4.mp3">One final trait that I have that would be perfect for this position is my organizational skills. 
I'm very detailed and plan very well.</a>"

<h2>What kind of salary are you looking for?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I122/sentence/I122S1.mp3">What kind of salary are you looking for?</a>"
"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I122/sentence/I122S2.mp3">What pay range are you looking for?</a>"</b>

There are a couple of ways to answer this. 
If you state a figure, you risk stating something that is too high, or something that is too low. 
Either case, you will not benefit from this question. 
A lot of people suggest saying something like, "<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I122/sentence/I122S3.mp3">I'm sure whatever I'm offered will be a fair price.</a>" But I don't agree. 
It is a safe answer, but if I was the interviewer, I would appreciate numbers instead of a safe answer. 
So I recommend answering this question with a range. 
I'll explain this more in the negotiation portion, but just in case you skip that section, here are some examples.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I122/sentence/I122S4.mp3">I'm expecting somewhere between $50,000 - $60,000.</a>"

If you know the pay for the position you are applying for. 
Then giving a figure is not that bad. 
Just state something a little higher with a small range included

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I122/sentence/I122S5.mp3">I know that the average pay for this position is roughly around $45,000, but because I have a couple years more experience, I would want something around $48,000 to $50,000.</a>"

If the salary range is already included in the job description, then you can answer that you are willing to consider any offers stated in the job description.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I122/sentence/I122S6.mp3">The job description says that the salary will be around $45,000 to $53,000. I think it's a fair range.</a>"

<h2>That's a high salary for this position! Where did you come up with that figure?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I123/sentence/I123S1.mp3">That's a high salary for this position! Where did you come up with that figure?</a>"</b>

If you said a figure that was too high, you might hear this question from the interviewer. 
This is not good because they would only ask this if the figure you stated was too high. 
So I would first justify the larger figure and explain that would consider a little less.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I123/sentence/I123S2.mp3">I have three more years of experience that will help a lot. 
I also have a college degree that is not stated as a requirement. 
But if the figure is too high, I would consider something a little less.</a>"

<h2>How much do you currently get paid?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I124/sentence/I124S1.mp3">How much do you currently get paid?</a>"</b>

I don't think you can lie about this question. 
It's easy to find out the truth. 
I would recommend saying exactly how much you made.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I124/sentence/I124S2.mp3">I was paid $50,000 a year plus an 8% bonus.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I124/sentence/I124S3.mp3">I received $27.50 an hour at my last position.</a>"

<h2>When are you able to start?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I125/sentence/I125S1.mp3">When are you able to start?</a>"</b>

If you are not working, then you are able to start immediately. 
But saying immediately sounds too desperate so tell them next Monday or something. 
If you are currently employed, then you have to show that you are responsible by giving your current employer a two week notice.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I125/sentence/I125S2.mp3">I'll be able to start as early as next Monday.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I125/sentence/I125S3.mp3">I have to give my current employer a two week notice so I could start immediately after that.</a>"

<h2>Are you considering any other offers right now?</h2>

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I126/sentence/I126S1.mp3">Are you considering any other offers right now?</a>"</b>

This question is not asking if you got an offer or not. 
It is asking if you are considering it. 
Regardless, you can tell them the truth.

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I126/sentence/I126S2.mp3">I'm not considering any of my offers right now.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I126/sentence/I126S3.mp3">I was considering an offer I received last week, but I don't think I will be accepting that position.</a>"

"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I126/sentence/I126S4.mp3">I'm thinking about an offer I have, but I want to keep my options open.</a>"

<h2>Asking Questions</h2>

<b>Asking Questions</b>

Most of the time, the person interviewing you will ask if you have any questions. 
It is important that you ask intelligent and relevant questions. 
Make sure you prepare some questions before you interview so you can learn more about the company and the position. 
Here is a small list of questions you can ask. 
Feel free to create more of your own.

<b>"<a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/audio871/AudioTE1/I127/sentence/I127S1.mp3">Do you have any questions?</a>"</b>
