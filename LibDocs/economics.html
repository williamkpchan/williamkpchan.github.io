'<h2>acceleration rate vs growth, debt</h2><br>They are different things.<br><br>6.5% is a ratio expressing the rate of acceleration, not growth. <br><br>Knowing a ratio, like 6.5%, tells you nothing about growth unless you know what to multiply it with. <br>Growth is a value derived by multiplying the rate of acceleration with the previous year\'s GDP and is expressed in RMB or $. <br><br>Growth $ = Annual GDP $ x Rate of acceleration.<br><br>In 2006, China\'s economy was $7.6 trillion. <br>Growing at 12%, it added $761 billion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $761 billion. <br>[7.6 x 1.12B]<br><br>In 2016, China\'s economy was $21.1 trillion. <br>Growing at 6.7%, it added $1.3 trillion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $1.3 trillion [1.06 = $1.27T].<br><br>So China\'s economy is not slowing down, it is speeding up.<br><br>What about debt? <br>We are often told that China\'s indebtedness is serious but not about China\'s assets. <br>How do China\'s assets compare to its debt? <br>In other words, how easy is it for China to pay its debts? <br>Here are two charts that give you some idea. <br><br>We are told that all debt (all Chinese debt?) is bad, but this is nonsense. <br>The entire world\'s economy runs on debt. U.S. Treasury Bonds are pure debt. <br>Even currency is a form of debt.<br><br>What\'s not discussed is the quality of the debt: will the debt-holder be repaid? <br>Will she receive the promised interest payments regularly for the life of the debt? <br>Will the final value of the debt, after adjusting for inflation, make the investment worthwhile?<br><br>Happily, Chinese government debt is of high quality, partly because the Chinese government has access to the safest, most lucrative investment opportunities and can, in a sense, guarantee them because it owns the underlying assets. <br>When it builds a new high speed rail line, for example, it owns the land around the new railway stops and can develop the land very profitably. <br>The cash flow from that development then goes to paying off the debt–usually in 15 years. <br>The St Louis Federal Reserve was curious and published a draft report, Is Government Spending a Free Lunch? <br>Evidence from China, saying that Chinese government investments yields a Keynesian multiplier of between two and three (compared to America\'s 0.9.), so there\'s room for more profitable investment.<br><br>Another factor that China alarmists overlook is growth. <br><br>If you know your wages will double in the next ten years, you can afford a bigger mortgage or higher car payments because you\'ll have more money to repay the debt. <br>China\'s economy has doubled every ten years for the past 40 years and, at that rate, it will be easier for China to repay its debts than for any country on earth. <br>',
'<h2>If the USA embargoed China</h2><br>The US embargoed China before, for 20+ years. <br>The result is that today, China is the most embargo-resistant country in the world by far. <br>There is no other country, not the US, not Russia, as embargo-resistant as China.<br><br>The US, EU, and Japan implemented the most thorough economic embargo on China at the start of the Korean War, which covered over 400 classes of products, including farm, fish and forestry products, fertilizers, coal, chemicals and metals, passenger cars, agricultural, industrial and office equipment and certain electronic and communications equipment. <br>Trains and airplanes belonged to the "don\'t even think about it" categories. <br>The embargo lasted from 1950 - 1971. <br>It taught China a lesson - whatever you don\'t make, you don\'t have. <br><br>U.S. Ends Ban on China Trade<br>If you want to know how big a lesson China had learned, just look at this chart below:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c59a6864c5c8ef2eace19b72b06c52a"><br>This is the wheat yield per hectare in China. <br>Agricultural yield depends on three factors: irrigation, seed, fertilizer. <br>China had irrigation and seed, but fertilizer was embargoed. <br>In 1949 the yield was about 600 kg/hectare, and according to the US ambassador at that time, 3 - 7 million people in China starved to death every year before 1949. <br>It was basically subsistence-level farming. <br>The famous "Great Leap Forward" in 1958 - 1961 caused the little dip in yield you see on the graph from 1958 - 1961, which people blamed it on Mao\'s wrong agriculture policy. <br>Just a little dip, and mass starvation was the result. <br>But once the embargo lifted in 1971 and fertilizers started flowing into China, the wheat yield experienced a 5-fold increase, from 600 kg/hectare to 3200 kg/hectare! Yeah, if the fertilizer had started flowing in earlier, China would not have been nearly so fragile that any policy mistake leads to mass starvation. <br>But when fertilizer is embargoed, and you don\'t know how to make it yourself, well, you get to starve.<br>The one country who helped China the most at that time was Russia. <br>Russia probably won\'t do so ever again, but back then it was a communist country and actually believed in just giving technologies to fellow communist countries for free. <br>A lot of countries got their domestic industries started this way, but China, despite the fact that most of the population were illiterate, turned out to have benefited the most . <br>Russia transferred 156 complete industrial lines to China in the 50\'s and 60\'s, including coal, iron, engine, tire, tooling, fertilizer, etc. <br>Almost all of them are heavy industries that are out of date by now, but it\'s like somebody has to move from elementary school to middle school to high school to university - without this transition, the Chinese would have a really hard time catching on to the more advanced technologies later. <br>The Russians were really good - taught the Chinese hand-by-hand every step of the way.<br>Many people believed that was the result of the "trust-building exercise" of the Korean War, where over 200,000 Chinese lost their lives. <br>This was the beginning of transforming China from a poor starving farm to a huge profitable factory. <br>Then as soon as the embargo was lifted, the Chinese government in the 70\'s spent a lot of money to buy technology from Germany, France, Japan, and the other Western countries, and started building their own chemical and transportation industries from scratch. <br>20 years later, China had enough industrial knowledge to be able to reverse-engineer most of the stuff she ever laid her eyes on. <br>The "market for technology" strategy later on, when the Chinese market grew big enough to be attractive, also helped moving a lot of production to China.<br>With the fall of USSR in the 90\'s, the US and her allies started the "globalization", basically move the low-margin businesses out of the country and keep the high-margin businesses (like finance, etc.) in. <br>Well, China has a different take on this. <br>After all, it\'s the country that has been put under the most extreme embargo for over 20 years. <br>She doesn\'t care about money as much as whether she gets to have the stuff, because if there is any disturbance in the normal functioning market, you can have money but nowhere to buy the stuff. <br>So she jumped enthusiastically onto the globalization bandwagon and yelled, "come, globalized your stuff to me! I\'ll make it cheaply for you!"<br>Before the 90\'s, the US, USSR, and China were the only 3 countries who had the industrial infrastructure to make stuff from scratch (ores, coal, petroleum, rubber) to finished products. <br>Then USSR imploded and the US globalized. <br>Now, China is the only one who can make 90% of all the world products from scratch to finish. <br>It\'s the most self-sufficient country in the world.<br>So now, if you put China under embargo again, the quality of life in China should by-and-large be ok, but it\'s probably going to be a very fast way to put the brakes on 100% of global industries. <br>The "made-in China" stuff is actually the smaller concern. <br>I bet every industry will have at least some parts/tooling that are imported from China. <br>Remember for a complex system with hundreds of components, it takes only one critical components missing to stop the whole production. <br>You can replace them, but it\'s going to take time, and it may require developing additional technology and industry know-how to get there. <br>In the meantime, everything is going to grind to a halt waiting for parts.<br>China exports $2.3 trillions worth of products a year. <br>20% to the US, 20% to EU, and the rest goes to the third-world countries in every continent. <br>There are over 100 US banks and tens of thousands of US-China joint venture companies in China. <br>Conversely, there are tons of Chinese companies in every continent as well. <br>A US embargo of China is frankly unthinkable, because it would hurt every single country on earth. <br>On the other hand, when all countries work together, everybody makes money together. <br>This is the whole point of globalization, isn\'t it, that everyone will be dependent on each other and thus all of us will have the incentive to maintain the peace?',
'<h2>AI in China compared to the U.S.</h2><br>A major difference between US AI and China AI is that China AI is all about implementation.<br><br>In research, US has about 60% of the world\'s top 1000 top researchers, and China less than 10%. <br>The top US researchers are both academia and industry, while the top Chinese researchers are generally in the industry, while academia lags behind the US substantially. <br>Chinese research papers have increased in quality rapidly over the years, but it will take a long time to catch up with the US. <br>(For more details on this, see my book AI Superpowers)<br><br>Deep learning is the single greatest invention so far in the Era of Discovery, which was led by the U.S.. <br>But since the deep learning breakthrough, we\'ve already entered the Era of Implementation where what matters is execution, product quality, speed, and data. <br>And that\'s where China comes in.<br><br>China\'s technological execution is built on incredible work ethic. <br>Nearly abandoning of my wife in the delivery room is nothing compared to the entrepreneurs in China. <br>As a venture capitalist in China, I once saw a startup claim that it offered great work-life balance because it was “996”. <br>What\'s 996? 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. <br>Most other startups in China are 997.<br><br>Chinese product quality has improved dramatically due to intense competition. <br>Silicon Valley competition resembles the old wars where each side takes its turn to fire. <br>In China, competition is like gladiators in the coliseum, fighting to the death with no holds barred. <br>Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product at lightning speed, and to develop impregnable business models. <br>As a result, Wechat and Weibo have evolved into arguably better products than products from Facebook and Twitter.<br><br>Chinese market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. <br>Just within the last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction tool, replacing cash and credit cards. <br>Total transaction in 2017 was $18.8 trillion, even larger than China\'s GDP. <br>How\'s that possible? China\'s mobile payments are built on the world\'s best infrastructure: nearly zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. <br>Over 700 million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline, loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a beggar.<br><br>All of this is amplified by China\'s enormous market size, which generates the treasure trove of data which is the critical rocket fuel for AI. <br>China\'s data edge is 3 times the US based on mobile users ratio, 10 times the US in food delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle rides. <br>(The few paragraphs above come from my TED talk this year).<br><br>All this rich data is used to make Chinese companies\' AI work better. <br>Today, China has the world\'s most valuable companies in computer vision, drones, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation. <br>The total valuation of Chinese computer vision companies is about $10B, and the total valuation of Chinese speech recognition companies is also about $10B.<br><br>Internet is an area where AI giants blossomed. <br>The same is true for US and China. <br>For US: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. <br>For China: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. <br>These seven companies have a disproportionate share of AI people (in particular Google has the most).<br><br>China has a number of industrial AI opportunities in “late mover advantage”, that is when the industry lags the US, AI can make a big difference. <br>We\'ve seen this in payments, and will soon see it in retail, healthcare, and education (for AI & education, watch the upcoming 60 Minutes).<br><br>So, not unexpectedly, in VC funding, China has 48% of the world\'s funding, while US 38%.<br>',
'<h2>Where is the end of the falling economy in China?</h2><br>There is no end because time doesn\'t end and China won\'t end.<br><br>Having said that, the Chinese government is using the downturn to prune back on companies which do not have bright futures, and is providing assistance to the industries which will be in demand in the future such as AI.<br><br>',
