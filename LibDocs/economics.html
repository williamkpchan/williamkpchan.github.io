'<h2>acceleration rate vs growth, debt</h2><br>They are different things.<br><br>6.5% is a ratio expressing the rate of acceleration, not growth. <br><br>Knowing a ratio, like 6.5%, tells you nothing about growth unless you know what to multiply it with. <br>Growth is a value derived by multiplying the rate of acceleration with the previous year\'s GDP and is expressed in RMB or $. <br><br>Growth $ = Annual GDP $ x Rate of acceleration.<br><br>In 2006, China\'s economy was $7.6 trillion. <br>Growing at 12%, it added $761 billion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $761 billion. <br>[7.6 x 1.12B]<br><br>In 2016, China\'s economy was $21.1 trillion. <br>Growing at 6.7%, it added $1.3 trillion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $1.3 trillion [1.06 = $1.27T].<br><br>So China\'s economy is not slowing down, it is speeding up.<br><br>What about debt? <br>We are often told that China\'s indebtedness is serious but not about China\'s assets. <br>How do China\'s assets compare to its debt? <br>In other words, how easy is it for China to pay its debts? <br>Here are two charts that give you some idea. <br><br>We are told that all debt (all Chinese debt?) is bad, but this is nonsense. <br>The entire world\'s economy runs on debt. U.S. Treasury Bonds are pure debt. <br>Even currency is a form of debt.<br><br>What\'s not discussed is the quality of the debt: will the debt-holder be repaid? <br>Will she receive the promised interest payments regularly for the life of the debt? <br>Will the final value of the debt, after adjusting for inflation, make the investment worthwhile?<br><br>Happily, Chinese government debt is of high quality, partly because the Chinese government has access to the safest, most lucrative investment opportunities and can, in a sense, guarantee them because it owns the underlying assets. <br>When it builds a new high speed rail line, for example, it owns the land around the new railway stops and can develop the land very profitably. <br>The cash flow from that development then goes to paying off the debt–usually in 15 years. <br>The St Louis Federal Reserve was curious and published a draft report, Is Government Spending a Free Lunch? <br>Evidence from China, saying that Chinese government investments yields a Keynesian multiplier of between two and three (compared to America\'s 0.9.), so there\'s room for more profitable investment.<br><br>Another factor that China alarmists overlook is growth. <br><br>If you know your wages will double in the next ten years, you can afford a bigger mortgage or higher car payments because you\'ll have more money to repay the debt. <br>China\'s economy has doubled every ten years for the past 40 years and, at that rate, it will be easier for China to repay its debts than for any country on earth. <br>',
'<h2>If the USA embargoed China</h2><br>The US embargoed China before, for 20+ years. <br>The result is that today, China is the most embargo-resistant country in the world by far. <br>There is no other country, not the US, not Russia, as embargo-resistant as China.<br><br>The US, EU, and Japan implemented the most thorough economic embargo on China at the start of the Korean War, which covered over 400 classes of products, including farm, fish and forestry products, fertilizers, coal, chemicals and metals, passenger cars, agricultural, industrial and office equipment and certain electronic and communications equipment. <br>Trains and airplanes belonged to the "don\'t even think about it" categories. <br>The embargo lasted from 1950 - 1971. <br>It taught China a lesson - whatever you don\'t make, you don\'t have. <br><br>U.S. Ends Ban on China Trade<br>If you want to know how big a lesson China had learned, just look at this chart below:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c59a6864c5c8ef2eace19b72b06c52a"><br>This is the wheat yield per hectare in China. <br>Agricultural yield depends on three factors: irrigation, seed, fertilizer. <br>China had irrigation and seed, but fertilizer was embargoed. <br>In 1949 the yield was about 600 kg/hectare, and according to the US ambassador at that time, 3 - 7 million people in China starved to death every year before 1949. <br>It was basically subsistence-level farming. <br>The famous "Great Leap Forward" in 1958 - 1961 caused the little dip in yield you see on the graph from 1958 - 1961, which people blamed it on Mao\'s wrong agriculture policy. <br>Just a little dip, and mass starvation was the result. <br>But once the embargo lifted in 1971 and fertilizers started flowing into China, the wheat yield experienced a 5-fold increase, from 600 kg/hectare to 3200 kg/hectare! Yeah, if the fertilizer had started flowing in earlier, China would not have been nearly so fragile that any policy mistake leads to mass starvation. <br>But when fertilizer is embargoed, and you don\'t know how to make it yourself, well, you get to starve.<br>The one country who helped China the most at that time was Russia. <br>Russia probably won\'t do so ever again, but back then it was a communist country and actually believed in just giving technologies to fellow communist countries for free. <br>A lot of countries got their domestic industries started this way, but China, despite the fact that most of the population were illiterate, turned out to have benefited the most . <br>Russia transferred 156 complete industrial lines to China in the 50\'s and 60\'s, including coal, iron, engine, tire, tooling, fertilizer, etc. <br>Almost all of them are heavy industries that are out of date by now, but it\'s like somebody has to move from elementary school to middle school to high school to university - without this transition, the Chinese would have a really hard time catching on to the more advanced technologies later. <br>The Russians were really good - taught the Chinese hand-by-hand every step of the way.<br>Many people believed that was the result of the "trust-building exercise" of the Korean War, where over 200,000 Chinese lost their lives. <br>This was the beginning of transforming China from a poor starving farm to a huge profitable factory. <br>Then as soon as the embargo was lifted, the Chinese government in the 70\'s spent a lot of money to buy technology from Germany, France, Japan, and the other Western countries, and started building their own chemical and transportation industries from scratch. <br>20 years later, China had enough industrial knowledge to be able to reverse-engineer most of the stuff she ever laid her eyes on. <br>The "market for technology" strategy later on, when the Chinese market grew big enough to be attractive, also helped moving a lot of production to China.<br>With the fall of USSR in the 90\'s, the US and her allies started the "globalization", basically move the low-margin businesses out of the country and keep the high-margin businesses (like finance, etc.) in. <br>Well, China has a different take on this. <br>After all, it\'s the country that has been put under the most extreme embargo for over 20 years. <br>She doesn\'t care about money as much as whether she gets to have the stuff, because if there is any disturbance in the normal functioning market, you can have money but nowhere to buy the stuff. <br>So she jumped enthusiastically onto the globalization bandwagon and yelled, "come, globalized your stuff to me! I\'ll make it cheaply for you!"<br>Before the 90\'s, the US, USSR, and China were the only 3 countries who had the industrial infrastructure to make stuff from scratch (ores, coal, petroleum, rubber) to finished products. <br>Then USSR imploded and the US globalized. <br>Now, China is the only one who can make 90% of all the world products from scratch to finish. <br>It\'s the most self-sufficient country in the world.<br>So now, if you put China under embargo again, the quality of life in China should by-and-large be ok, but it\'s probably going to be a very fast way to put the brakes on 100% of global industries. <br>The "made-in China" stuff is actually the smaller concern. <br>I bet every industry will have at least some parts/tooling that are imported from China. <br>Remember for a complex system with hundreds of components, it takes only one critical components missing to stop the whole production. <br>You can replace them, but it\'s going to take time, and it may require developing additional technology and industry know-how to get there. <br>In the meantime, everything is going to grind to a halt waiting for parts.<br>China exports $2.3 trillions worth of products a year. <br>20% to the US, 20% to EU, and the rest goes to the third-world countries in every continent. <br>There are over 100 US banks and tens of thousands of US-China joint venture companies in China. <br>Conversely, there are tons of Chinese companies in every continent as well. <br>A US embargo of China is frankly unthinkable, because it would hurt every single country on earth. <br>On the other hand, when all countries work together, everybody makes money together. <br>This is the whole point of globalization, isn\'t it, that everyone will be dependent on each other and thus all of us will have the incentive to maintain the peace?',
'<h2>AI in China compared to the U.S.</h2><br>A major difference between US AI and China AI is that China AI is all about implementation.<br><br>In research, US has about 60% of the world\'s top 1000 top researchers, and China less than 10%. <br>The top US researchers are both academia and industry, while the top Chinese researchers are generally in the industry, while academia lags behind the US substantially. <br>Chinese research papers have increased in quality rapidly over the years, but it will take a long time to catch up with the US. <br>(For more details on this, see my book AI Superpowers)<br><br>Deep learning is the single greatest invention so far in the Era of Discovery, which was led by the U.S.. <br>But since the deep learning breakthrough, we\'ve already entered the Era of Implementation where what matters is execution, product quality, speed, and data. <br>And that\'s where China comes in.<br><br>China\'s technological execution is built on incredible work ethic. <br>Nearly abandoning of my wife in the delivery room is nothing compared to the entrepreneurs in China. <br>As a venture capitalist in China, I once saw a startup claim that it offered great work-life balance because it was “996”. <br>What\'s 996? 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. <br>Most other startups in China are 997.<br><br>Chinese product quality has improved dramatically due to intense competition. <br>Silicon Valley competition resembles the old wars where each side takes its turn to fire. <br>In China, competition is like gladiators in the coliseum, fighting to the death with no holds barred. <br>Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product at lightning speed, and to develop impregnable business models. <br>As a result, Wechat and Weibo have evolved into arguably better products than products from Facebook and Twitter.<br><br>Chinese market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. <br>Just within the last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction tool, replacing cash and credit cards. <br>Total transaction in 2017 was $18.8 trillion, even larger than China\'s GDP. <br>How\'s that possible? China\'s mobile payments are built on the world\'s best infrastructure: nearly zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. <br>Over 700 million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline, loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a beggar.<br><br>All of this is amplified by China\'s enormous market size, which generates the treasure trove of data which is the critical rocket fuel for AI. <br>China\'s data edge is 3 times the US based on mobile users ratio, 10 times the US in food delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle rides. <br>(The few paragraphs above come from my TED talk this year).<br><br>All this rich data is used to make Chinese companies\' AI work better. <br>Today, China has the world\'s most valuable companies in computer vision, drones, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation. <br>The total valuation of Chinese computer vision companies is about $10B, and the total valuation of Chinese speech recognition companies is also about $10B.<br><br>Internet is an area where AI giants blossomed. <br>The same is true for US and China. <br>For US: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. <br>For China: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. <br>These seven companies have a disproportionate share of AI people (in particular Google has the most).<br><br>China has a number of industrial AI opportunities in “late mover advantage”, that is when the industry lags the US, AI can make a big difference. <br>We\'ve seen this in payments, and will soon see it in retail, healthcare, and education (for AI & education, watch the upcoming 60 Minutes).<br><br>So, not unexpectedly, in VC funding, China has 48% of the world\'s funding, while US 38%.<br>',
'<h2>Where is the end of the falling economy in China?</h2><br>There is no end because time doesn\'t end and China won\'t end.<br><br>Having said that, the Chinese government is using the downturn to prune back on companies which do not have bright futures, and is providing assistance to the industries which will be in demand in the future such as AI.<br><br>',
'<h2>Why is Germany more economically successful than Russia and Ukraine, despite the latter having more natural resources, fertile land, warmer climates and more youthful populations?</h2><br>Germany isn’t actually that much more “successful” than Russia.

That said, Russia’s advanced economy is so different from Germany’s that it’s not apparent to most observers. For example, unlike Germany, Russia designs and builds huge numbers of its own hi-tech aircraft, built entirely with Russian engines, propellers, avionics, and control systems.

'<h2>AI不应翻译成“人工智能”</h2><br>智博会火热进行中，来自全球的智能科技领域的学界泰斗、业界翘楚、商界领袖带来顶尖的思想碰撞。<br>本文梳理了包括马云、马化腾、图灵奖得主、菲尔兹奖得主的演讲讨论干货。<br>AI应该翻译成为“机器智能”，翻译成“人工智能”是人类把自己看得过大、过高——马云<br>产业竞争由“单打”变为“双打”——马化腾<br>汽车是长了腿的智能手机——王传福<br>AI取代人类是一个谬论——Niklaus Wirth<br>目前并不存在万能的通用解决方法，但数学能为人工智能的发展找到深层次的规律——Alessio Figalli<br>8月26日，以“智能化：<br>为经济赋能，为生活添彩”的2019中国国际智能产业博览会（简称“智博会”）在重庆召开。<br>据悉，本次参会的嘉宾包括13名诺贝尔奖得主、4名图灵奖得主、2名菲尔兹奖得主、2名国际组织(机构)负责人、76名国内外知名院士、64名世界500强负责人等学者和大咖，为我们带来了顶尖的思想碰撞。<br>此外，还有来自全球的智能科技领域的学界泰斗、业界翘楚、商界领袖发表了主题演讲，今天，新智元为大家带来了演讲干货整理，一起来听听大师们的智慧。<br><br>马云：<br>AI翻译成“人工智能”是人类把自己看得过大、过高<br>马云以联合国数字合作高级别小组联合主席这个新身份亮相2019智博会，他分享了自己的一些思考和看法。<br>马云在演讲的开始提到，数字技术应该让人类的发展更加普惠、更加可持续、更加绿色。<br>同时，接下来全球化和技术都会产生巨大的变革：<br>“过去人类是依水而聚，只要有水的地方，人类都去寻找，未来人类会依照数据而居住，要找到通数据的地方。”<br>马云在演讲中谈及了该如何翻译“AI”，在他看来：<br>AI应该翻译成为“机器智能”，翻译成“人工智能”是人类把自己看得过大、过高。<br> <br>在马云看来，智能世界三要素包括：<br>互联网、大数据和云计算。<br>互联网是生产关系，大计算是生产力，大数据是生产资料。<br>未来是互联网、大数据以及大计算这些生产关系、生产力和生产资料的关系。<br>马云还谈到了机器与人的关系：<br>最终人应该更像人，机器应该更像机器。<br>“智能是改变世界的工具，智慧是改变智能的思想，引领未来的不是智能，引领未来的是智能背后人类的智慧。<br>动物讲究本能、机器讲究智能、人类必须坚持自己的智慧。<br>工业时代，技术让人类向外探索得更远、更广阔，我们一直探索月球、探索火星，但是人们特别关心的是技术、产品和服务，而事实上我坚定认为智能时代应该是让人类更加关注自己、关注内心、更加懂得人类本身。<br>智能世界不是让万物像人，而是让万物像人一样去学习，智能时代要解决的是人解决不了的问题，了解人不能了解的东西。<br>机器要有自己独特的思考，人类必须尊重、敬畏机器的智能。<br>很多事情对人类来讲很难，但机器非常容易，很多事情对机器很难，对人类来讲却非常容易。<br>我们不断在研究机器怎么样可以像手一样灵活，其实人类永远会比机器更加灵活。<br>数据标注对于人类来讲非常容易，但是对于机器来讲就变得非常复杂。<br>蒸汽机从来没有模仿过人的双臂，汽车从来没有模仿过人的双腿，计算机绝对不能模仿人脑的思考。<br>过去我们把人变成了机器，未来机器会变成人，但最终人应该更像人，机器应该更像机器。”<br>在马云看来：<br>5G时代，通讯不会超过20%，物联网将占80%以上。<br>“智慧时代千万不要只把精力花在技术上、花在设备上，而是把我们的技术、设备花在人的进步身上、人的感受身上。<br>智能时代不应该、也不能让人失业，而是让人去做更有价值的事情。<br>1G、2G是以个人电脑、PC为主，3G、4G以手机，也就是多了一个手机，而5G开始，只要通电的都是端，所有通电的都会连接起来。<br>互联网时代是人与人、人与机器的关系，5G时代是机器与机器、端与端之间的关系，5G时代会把很多企业永远留在4G和3G时代，包括我们BAT，往往这个时代做得最好的会被下一个时代所淘汰，只有用好5G、尊重5G，并且担当起5G时代的创新和责任，才有可能进入5G时代。<br>我们现在讲了很多5G，其实现在讨论的大部分都是跟5G的通讯有关，其实5G时代，通讯不会超过20%，物联网将占80%以上。<br>智能世界，每一样东西都会有一个芯片，而这些芯片之间，它们会讲话、会计算、会付费、会交流。<br>所以我想我们对于未来的认识绝对不能停留在今天。”<br>马云在演讲中还谈到了BAT，他认为：<br>BAT不是多了，而是少了。<br>“今天中国的数字经济有这样的发展，有了BAT这样规模的企业，我认为这是和中国经济在过去二十年的发展，成为世界第二大经济体的体量是相吻合的。<br>现在有人说中国互联网巨头，担心中国的企业做得越大，我个人觉得BAT不是多了，而是少了，中国这样的国家应该有几十家这样大的企业。<br>很多人担心创新企业、市场企业做大，中国现在的互联网公司是靠创新、靠市场做起来的，我们不应该害怕创新企业变成巨头，我们应该担心的是巨头不创新。”<br><br>马化腾：<br>产业竞争“单打”变为“双打”，腾讯未来重心是开源<br>马化腾从行业一线从业者的角度分享了关于“如何应对新一轮科技和产业革命”的一些看法。<br>1、产业竞争的主赛场正在由过去的“单打”PK逐渐变为“双打”比赛。<br>过去，商业竞争往往是围绕垂直细分产业的单打独斗。<br>今天，当信息化这个最大的变量，开始融入各行各业，产业竞争的方式正在发生改变：<br>垂直纵深的各个实体产业，与横向延伸的信息产业相结合，形成纵横交错的新搭档。<br>产业竞争，已经演变为“双打”比赛。<br>马化腾认为，工信部很早就提出的“两化融合”具有重要的战略意义，产业互联网正是“两化融合”的重要载体和突破口。<br>而目前产业竞争的主赛场，也正在由“单打”逐渐变为“双打”。<br>2、面对经济转型和产业升级，需要不断激发创新潜力，打造更多的“拳头产品”。<br>过去几十年，中国经济和产业的高速发展，主要得益于外延式拓展。<br>未来几十年，中国要实现高质量发展，必须发挥出我们的创新潜力。<br>今天的中国产业界，需要更多拼搏精神。<br>只有最大限度地发挥创新潜力，我们才能把“挑战”变成“机遇”。<br>3、攀登科技和产业的“珠峰”，往往要依赖“科技共同体”和“全球产业生态”。<br>正如5G并不是一项单一技术，而是一系列技术创新，需要“联合登山队”来征服。<br>今天，没有哪个国家完全拥有全球新一轮科技和产业革命所需的全部资源、技术和能力。<br>产业割裂和技术脱钩将会损害整个人类的长远利益。<br>由此，我们更加清楚地看到中国全面深化改革开放的战略定力和远见。<br>目前，腾讯已在GitHub上发布82个repo，涉及微信、腾讯云、腾讯游戏、腾讯AI、腾讯安全等相关领域，为行业提供全面的解决方案、帮助开发者获取相应技术能力、提供标准化的工具框架。<br>据报道，腾讯专门成立了开源管理办公室，下设开源管理组、腾讯开源联盟和开源合规组三大组织，由不同业务的技术专家、负责人、技术领袖组成开源联盟组委会和专家团，并且将三个广受社区认可的开源项目Tars、TSeer和Angel分别捐赠Linux基金会，Linux深度学习基金会，并将长期于基金会运作。<br>AI超越人类？<br>图灵奖和菲尔兹奖得主怎么看<br>在本届智博会上，图灵奖和菲尔兹奖得主也分享了自己关于AI能否超越人类的看法。<br>1984年图灵奖获得者尼古拉斯·沃斯（Niklaus Wirth）认为：<br>AI只能产生人类已经投入进去的东西，并不具有创造性，AI取代人类是一个谬论。<br><br>尼古拉斯·沃斯<br>不过他也表达了一丝担忧，认为给AI提供的养料有点过多，我们不能判断它接下来做什么、对或错。<br>如果人类不能干预AI决策，就会存在极大的风险。<br>他同时还认为，中国的优势在于拥有庞大的数据，如果要发展大数据智能化产业，需要培养更多人工智能方面的人才。<br>1985年图灵奖获得者理查德·卡普（Richard Manning Karp）也不同意AI统治世界的观点。<br><br>理查德·卡普<br>他认为现在的人工智能连小孩都不如，而且只有在特定的场景下才能完全发挥作用，很多场景下，AI的表现差强人意。<br>相比统治人类，卡普更担心AI技术被滥用，甚至被别有用心的人利用。<br>2015年图灵奖获得者马丁·赫尔曼（Martin Edward Hellman）表示：<br>说得对！<br>2018年菲尔兹奖获得者考切尔·比尔卡尔（Caucher Birkar）对AI的未来不太敢轻易下定论，他自称自己是一个纯数学家而非计算机科学家。<br><br>考切尔·比尔卡尔<br>2018年菲尔兹奖得主阿莱西奥·菲加利（Alessio Figalli）称人工智能的不完美之处，目前并不存在万能的通用解决方法，但数学能为人工智能的发展找到深层次的规律。<br>阿莱西奥·菲加利<br>数学不但能为人工智能提供数据分析、机器算法等工具，更能在发展规律和思维层次上为人工智能带来提升和优化。<br>他建议人工智能领域的研究者和工作者重视数学，加强学科融合互通，让数学在人工智能的发展中发挥更重要的作用。<br>',
'<h2><span class="orange">which city has the brightest future, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Shenzhen?</span></h2><br>Let me detour a little before going on topic.<br>I bet most people cannot find Guizhou on the map.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e9991e22f04a6c1b92987aecdbe86972"><br>It is one of China’s poorer provinces, poorer than even Tibet.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-97c4174987dc872185652deb067bb576"><br>But interesting developments have been reported in Guizhou recently, including its newfound status as a data center hub, turning natural disadvantages into competitive leverage. Guizhou is well positioned to ride the big data wave in the coming decades.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2c6bb36fffbb3d8fc345c1446d397f75"><br>Guizhou is also home to the world’s largest radio telescope, a 500m diameter behemoth that necessitated the creation of a 5km-wide radio-silent zone. Again, nicely played for an impoverished province.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d31ca01d954685282219932384e51b26"><br>Watch this man. Big data arrived in Guizhou during his term as governor. Good things seem to happen wherever Chen Min’er goes so I’m impatient to discover what he has in store for the 30m Chongqing residents living in the largest city proper worldwide.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0a7f1d70f2870352f40fc7384105ba9"><br>What does Guizhou have to do with the topic at hand, namely three prosperous coastal cities?<br>On the surface, not much, except I believe the big surprises will no longer be the exclusive domain of the advantageous coast but further inland as China transits into a consumption- and service-led economy from an export-driven one. China’s connectivity has been upgraded at warp speed and this has dramatically equalized geographic disadvantage the interior has faced for millennia. There are plenty of low-hanging fruit ripe for picking just one or two provinces away from the coast.<br>If I were an investor, the inland belt is where I will focus on in the coming two or three decades.<br>Crystal ball gazing Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong is hard. The easy answer is Shanghai, because Shanghai may well be the best known Chinese city after Hong Kong from a cultural and international standpoint. She has the benefit of clear political direction, excellent infrastructure and societal order. The Free Trade Zone has been continuously expanding since initialization in 2013. Much of China’s shipping will be funneled through Shanghai. She is already the world’s busiest port.<br>Shanghai is already China’s London or New York. It will overtake Hong Kong and Singapore as Asia’s primary financial center when the internationalization of the Yuan is complete. The world’s money will no longer flow through London and New York but also Shanghai, only it will be denominated in Yuan using alternatives to SWIFT, much like SEPA.<br>What counts against Shanghai is the argument it is already too big, and it grew too fast during the crazy 90s and 2000s. The excesses notwithstanding, changing needs made some investments look shortsighted, as relatively new infrastructure was repeatedly demolished to make way for even newer ones.<br>Shanghai’s growth is being curtailed today by sky-high real estate, and traffic congestion. Thoughtful solutions are needed to temper more moderate growth with quality of life.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb55f020e816e7f1423c2d605f700336"><br>Shenzhen is today’s China’s tech center. Not so much software and design like Silicon Valley, but more next-gen hardware like drones, mobility scooters, IP cameras and medical devices.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d244ba3d9b314bfb224187de28958df"><br>Huawei recently opened a gorgeous 3.5 sq. mile campus in neighboring Dongguan, cementing Shenzhen’s status as China’s tech hub in the coming decades. World class designs will come out of Shenzhen, as it becomes a magnet for top-tier talent. Huawei is already offering CNY2+ million packages to freshly minted but exceptional PhD graduates.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-64b76166349759d3e8e687de53ef4b4a"><br>The recently opened Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge will further improve Shenzhen’s connectivity, as travel times from Zhuhai to Shenzhen is cut by more than half. It will be interesting to follow the synergy that develop in the Pearl River Delta in the coming decades. Thankfully, pollution and congestion is less severe than Shanghai here.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a8bb1d5bbe8218d9f77530b9892edf6"><br>Finally, we come to the elephant in the room. Hong Kong deserves a section all on its own.<br>As a city that has been continuously developed for more than 150 years, Hong Kong has many more problems rooted in history. In recent decades, the poisoned chalice of democracy left by the British has crippled the city’s governance. Lack of political leadership has prevented Hong Kong from implementing solutions to long term problems such as housing, education, and economic diversification.<br>Put simply, Hong Kong has been operating like a boxer with one hand tied behind his back. But amazingly, Hong Kong has done remarkably well post-handover, despite moderate population growth of 14%.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-589fc84435c6308e66826a5de240363b"><br>However, two decades after handover, we still see this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af0a78815c94af41edc0c962fab05709"><br>and this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22b990283783406ca57a648025758529"><br>and this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-43e742976f343735f69af3c3c95008cd"><br>In a city with nominal GDP per capita of US$48,000, one of the highest in Asia.<br>Prosperity mired in the incomprehensible.<br>The average Hong Kong youth, as the protests show, may be somewhat misguided. But make no mistake, Hong Kong’s uber competitiveness has produced generation after generation of outsize talent. Let me quote George Yeo:<br><blockquote><i>Apart from the high politics, at the atomic level, we have good people who are responsible who care for one another, I think </i><b><i>upon these bricks you can build the most wonderful structures</i></b><i>. But if the bricks are weak or crumble, then however you try, however brilliant the architect, nothing much is going to come out of it. So when I look at Hong Kong, I said yes there are problems, and the future is uncertain, and many things are not within their control, but they have good people, strong people, and they will survive.</i></blockquote><br>If a crippled Hong Kong with intractable problems today can consistently grow at 3, 4 percent, driven by talented people who have always found solutions to stay afloat, what do you think will happen when Hong Kong frees herself from the shackles she has put on and begin to seriously tackle her varied problems? Hong Kong is still very far away from being a futuristic 21st century city, despite her wealth and prosperity.<br>A crippled Hong Kong has pockets of impressive excellence, finding many urban solutions to the world’s densest population in many parts Kowloon and Hong Kong island.<br>What can an unencumbered people reimagine Hong Kong to be?<br>I may not live to see the day, but I hope Hong Kong grows up and claims her rightful spot as the jewel of the Pearl River Delta.<br>',
'<h2><span class="red">China and Iran flesh out strategic partnership</span></h2><br><img src="https://www.petroleum-economist.com/media/6837/tehran-mountains.jpg?mode=pad&width=1600&format=jpg&quality=90&slimmage=true&rnd=132119622720000000"><br><h3>Staggered 25-year deal could mark seismic shift in the global hydrocarbons sector</h3><br>Iran\'s foreign minister Mohammad Zarif paid a visit to his Chinese counterpart Wang Li at the end of August to present a road map for the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership, signed in 2016.<br>The updated agreement echoes many of the points contained in previous China-Iran accords, and already in the public domain. <br>However, many of the key specifics of this new understanding will not be released to the public, despite representing a potentially material shift to the global balance of the oil and gas sector, according to a senior source closely connected to Iran\'s petroleum ministry who spoke exclusively to <em>Petroleum Economist</em> in late August.<br>The central pillar of the new deal is that China will invest $280bn developing Iran\'s oil, gas and petrochemicals sectors. <br>This amount may be front-loaded into the first five-year period of the deal but the understanding is that further amounts will be available in every subsequent five-year period, subject to both parties\' agreement.<br>There will be another $120bn investment in upgrading Iran\'s transport and manufacturing infrastructure, which again can be front-loaded into the first five-year period and added to in each subsequent period should both parties agree.<br><h3>Chinese presence</h3><br>Among other benefits, Chinese companies will be given the first refusal to bid on any new, stalled or uncompleted oil and gasfield developments. <br>Chinese firms will also have first refusal on opportunities to become involved with any and all petchems projects in Iran, including the provision of technology, systems, process ingredients and personnel required to complete such projects.<br>"This will include up to 5,000 Chinese security personnel on the ground in Iran to protect Chinese projects, and there will be additional personnel and material available to protect the eventual transit of oil, gas and petchems supply from Iran to China, where necessary, including through the Persian Gulf," says the Iranian source.<br>"China will also be able to buy any and all oil, gas and petchems products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12pc to the six-month rolling mean price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6pc to 8pc of that metric for risk-adjusted compensation."<br>Under the terms of the new agreement, <em>Petroleum Economist</em> understands, China will be granted the right to delay payment for Iranian production up to two years. <br>China will also be able to pay in soft currencies that it has accrued from doing business in Africa and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) states, in addition to using renminbi should the need arise—meaning that no US dollars will be involved in these commodity transaction payments from China to Iran.<br>"Given the exchange rates involved in converting these soft currencies into hard currencies that Iran can obtain from its friendly Western banks—including Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank [in Germany], Oberbank [in Austria] and Halkbank [in Turkey]—China is looking at another 8-12pc discount [relative to the dollar price of the average benchmarks], which means a total discount of up to 32pc for China on all oil, gas and petchems purchases," the source says.<br>Another positive factor for China is that its close involvement in the build-out of Iran\'s manufacturing infrastructure will be entirely in line with its One Belt, One Road initiative. <br>China intends to utilise the low cost labour available in Iran to build factories, designed and overseen by large Chinese manufacturing companies, with identical specifications and operations to those in China, according to the Iranian source.<br><h3>Transport infrastructure</h3><br>The resulting products will be able to enter Western markets via routes built or enhanced by China\'s increasing involvement in Iran\'s transport infrastructure. <br>When the draft deal was presented in late August to Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei by Iran\'s vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri—and senior figures from the Economic and Finance Ministry, the Petroleum Ministry and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—he announced that Iran had signed a contract with China to implement a project to electrify the main 900km railway connecting Tehran to the north-eastern city of Mashhad. <br>Jahangiri added that there are also plans to establish a Tehran-Qom-Isfahan high-speed train line and to extend this upgraded network up to the north-west through Tabriz.<br>Tabriz, home to a number of key oil, gas and petchems sites, and the starting point for the Tabriz-Ankara gas pipeline, will be a pivot point of the 2,300km New Silk Road that links Urumqi (the capital of China\'s western Xinjiang Province) to Tehran, connecting Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan along the way, and then via Turkey into Europe, says the Iranian source.<br>The pipeline plan will require the co-operation of Russia, as it regards the FSU states as its backyard. <br>And, because, until recently, Russia was weighing a similarly all-encompassing standalone deal with Iran. <br>So, according to the source, the agreement includes a clause allowing at least one Russian company to have the option of being involved, also on discounted terms, alongside a Chinese operator.<br><h3>Benefits for Iran</h3><br>The Iranians expect three key positives from the 25-year deal, according to the source. <br>The first flows from China being one of just five countries to hold permanent member status on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). <br>Russia, tangentially included in the new deal, also holds a seat, alongside the US, the UK and France.<br>"In order to circumvent any further ramping up of sanctions—and over time encourage the US to come back to the negotiating table—Iran now has two out of five UNSC votes on its side. <br>The fact that [Iran foreign minister Mohammad] Zarif showed up unexpectedly at the G7 summit in August at the invitation of France may imply it has another permanent member on side," he adds.<br>A second Iranian positive is that the deal will allow it to finally expedite increases in oil and gas production from three of its key fields. <br>China has agreed to up the pace on its development of one of Iran\'s flagship gas field project, Phase 11 of the giant South Pars gas field (SP11). <br>China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of China\'s \'big three\' producers, added to its 30pc holding in the field when it took over Total\'s 50.1pc stake, following the French major\'s withdrawal in response to US sanctions. <br>CNPC had since made little progress developing SP11—a 30pc+ discount to the global market price on potential condensate and LNG exports could change that.<br>China has also agreed to increase production from Iran\'s West Karoun oil fields—including North Azadegan, operated by CNPC, and Yadavaran, operated by fellow \'big three\' firm Sinopec—by an additional 500,000bl/d by the end of 2020. <br>Iran hopes to increase projected recovery rates from these West Karoun fields, which it shares with neighbour Iraq, from a current 5pc of reserves in place to at least 25pc by the end of 2021 at the very latest. <br>"For every percentage point increase, the recoverable reserves figure would increase by 670mn bl, or around $34bn in revenues even with oil at $50/bl," the Iranian source says.<br>A final Iranian benefit is that China has agreed to increase imports of Iranian oil, in defiance of a US decision not to extend China\'s waiver on imports from Iran in May. <br>China\'s General Administration of Customs (GAC) figures released in late August show that, far from reducing its Iranian imports, China imported over 925,000bl/d from the country in July, up by 4.7pc month-on-month, from an already high base.<br>The actual figure is still higher, according to the Iranian source, with excess barrels being kept in floating storage in and around China; without having gone through customs they do not show up on customs data, but are effectively part of China\'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.<br>',
