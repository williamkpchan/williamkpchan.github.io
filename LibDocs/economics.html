'<h2>acceleration rate vs growth, debt</h2><br>They are different things.<br><br>6.5% is a ratio expressing the rate of acceleration, not growth. <br><br>Knowing a ratio, like 6.5%, tells you nothing about growth unless you know what to multiply it with. <br>Growth is a value derived by multiplying the rate of acceleration with the previous year\'s GDP and is expressed in RMB or $. <br><br>Growth $ = Annual GDP $ x Rate of acceleration.<br><br>In 2006, China\'s economy was $7.6 trillion. <br>Growing at 12%, it added $761 billion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $761 billion. <br>[7.6 x 1.12B]<br><br>In 2016, China\'s economy was $21.1 trillion. <br>Growing at 6.7%, it added $1.3 trillion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $1.3 trillion [1.06 = $1.27T].<br><br>So China\'s economy is not slowing down, it is speeding up.<br><br>What about debt? <br>We are often told that China\'s indebtedness is serious but not about China\'s assets. <br>How do China\'s assets compare to its debt? <br>In other words, how easy is it for China to pay its debts? <br>Here are two charts that give you some idea. <br><br>We are told that all debt (all Chinese debt?) is bad, but this is nonsense. <br>The entire world\'s economy runs on debt. U.S. Treasury Bonds are pure debt. <br>Even currency is a form of debt.<br><br>What\'s not discussed is the quality of the debt: will the debt-holder be repaid? <br>Will she receive the promised interest payments regularly for the life of the debt? <br>Will the final value of the debt, after adjusting for inflation, make the investment worthwhile?<br><br>Happily, Chinese government debt is of high quality, partly because the Chinese government has access to the safest, most lucrative investment opportunities and can, in a sense, guarantee them because it owns the underlying assets. <br>When it builds a new high speed rail line, for example, it owns the land around the new railway stops and can develop the land very profitably. <br>The cash flow from that development then goes to paying off the debt–usually in 15 years. <br>The St Louis Federal Reserve was curious and published a draft report, Is Government Spending a Free Lunch? <br>Evidence from China, saying that Chinese government investments yields a Keynesian multiplier of between two and three (compared to America\'s 0.9.), so there\'s room for more profitable investment.<br><br>Another factor that China alarmists overlook is growth. <br><br>If you know your wages will double in the next ten years, you can afford a bigger mortgage or higher car payments because you\'ll have more money to repay the debt. <br>China\'s economy has doubled every ten years for the past 40 years and, at that rate, it will be easier for China to repay its debts than for any country on earth. <br>',
'<h2>If the USA embargoed China</h2><br>The US embargoed China before, for 20+ years. <br>The result is that today, China is the most embargo-resistant country in the world by far. <br>There is no other country, not the US, not Russia, as embargo-resistant as China.<br><br>The US, EU, and Japan implemented the most thorough economic embargo on China at the start of the Korean War, which covered over 400 classes of products, including farm, fish and forestry products, fertilizers, coal, chemicals and metals, passenger cars, agricultural, industrial and office equipment and certain electronic and communications equipment. <br>Trains and airplanes belonged to the "don\'t even think about it" categories. <br>The embargo lasted from 1950 - 1971. <br>It taught China a lesson - whatever you don\'t make, you don\'t have. <br><br>U.S. Ends Ban on China Trade<br>If you want to know how big a lesson China had learned, just look at this chart below:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c59a6864c5c8ef2eace19b72b06c52a"><br>This is the wheat yield per hectare in China. <br>Agricultural yield depends on three factors: irrigation, seed, fertilizer. <br>China had irrigation and seed, but fertilizer was embargoed. <br>In 1949 the yield was about 600 kg/hectare, and according to the US ambassador at that time, 3 - 7 million people in China starved to death every year before 1949. <br>It was basically subsistence-level farming. <br>The famous "Great Leap Forward" in 1958 - 1961 caused the little dip in yield you see on the graph from 1958 - 1961, which people blamed it on Mao\'s wrong agriculture policy. <br>Just a little dip, and mass starvation was the result. <br>But once the embargo lifted in 1971 and fertilizers started flowing into China, the wheat yield experienced a 5-fold increase, from 600 kg/hectare to 3200 kg/hectare! Yeah, if the fertilizer had started flowing in earlier, China would not have been nearly so fragile that any policy mistake leads to mass starvation. <br>But when fertilizer is embargoed, and you don\'t know how to make it yourself, well, you get to starve.<br>The one country who helped China the most at that time was Russia. <br>Russia probably won\'t do so ever again, but back then it was a communist country and actually believed in just giving technologies to fellow communist countries for free. <br>A lot of countries got their domestic industries started this way, but China, despite the fact that most of the population were illiterate, turned out to have benefited the most . <br>Russia transferred 156 complete industrial lines to China in the 50\'s and 60\'s, including coal, iron, engine, tire, tooling, fertilizer, etc. <br>Almost all of them are heavy industries that are out of date by now, but it\'s like somebody has to move from elementary school to middle school to high school to university - without this transition, the Chinese would have a really hard time catching on to the more advanced technologies later. <br>The Russians were really good - taught the Chinese hand-by-hand every step of the way.<br>Many people believed that was the result of the "trust-building exercise" of the Korean War, where over 200,000 Chinese lost their lives. <br>This was the beginning of transforming China from a poor starving farm to a huge profitable factory. <br>Then as soon as the embargo was lifted, the Chinese government in the 70\'s spent a lot of money to buy technology from Germany, France, Japan, and the other Western countries, and started building their own chemical and transportation industries from scratch. <br>20 years later, China had enough industrial knowledge to be able to reverse-engineer most of the stuff she ever laid her eyes on. <br>The "market for technology" strategy later on, when the Chinese market grew big enough to be attractive, also helped moving a lot of production to China.<br>With the fall of USSR in the 90\'s, the US and her allies started the "globalization", basically move the low-margin businesses out of the country and keep the high-margin businesses (like finance, etc.) in. <br>Well, China has a different take on this. <br>After all, it\'s the country that has been put under the most extreme embargo for over 20 years. <br>She doesn\'t care about money as much as whether she gets to have the stuff, because if there is any disturbance in the normal functioning market, you can have money but nowhere to buy the stuff. <br>So she jumped enthusiastically onto the globalization bandwagon and yelled, "come, globalized your stuff to me! I\'ll make it cheaply for you!"<br>Before the 90\'s, the US, USSR, and China were the only 3 countries who had the industrial infrastructure to make stuff from scratch (ores, coal, petroleum, rubber) to finished products. <br>Then USSR imploded and the US globalized. <br>Now, China is the only one who can make 90% of all the world products from scratch to finish. <br>It\'s the most self-sufficient country in the world.<br>So now, if you put China under embargo again, the quality of life in China should by-and-large be ok, but it\'s probably going to be a very fast way to put the brakes on 100% of global industries. <br>The "made-in China" stuff is actually the smaller concern. <br>I bet every industry will have at least some parts/tooling that are imported from China. <br>Remember for a complex system with hundreds of components, it takes only one critical components missing to stop the whole production. <br>You can replace them, but it\'s going to take time, and it may require developing additional technology and industry know-how to get there. <br>In the meantime, everything is going to grind to a halt waiting for parts.<br>China exports $2.3 trillions worth of products a year. <br>20% to the US, 20% to EU, and the rest goes to the third-world countries in every continent. <br>There are over 100 US banks and tens of thousands of US-China joint venture companies in China. <br>Conversely, there are tons of Chinese companies in every continent as well. <br>A US embargo of China is frankly unthinkable, because it would hurt every single country on earth. <br>On the other hand, when all countries work together, everybody makes money together. <br>This is the whole point of globalization, isn\'t it, that everyone will be dependent on each other and thus all of us will have the incentive to maintain the peace?',
'<h2>AI in China compared to the U.S.</h2><br>A major difference between US AI and China AI is that China AI is all about implementation.<br><br>In research, US has about 60% of the world\'s top 1000 top researchers, and China less than 10%. <br>The top US researchers are both academia and industry, while the top Chinese researchers are generally in the industry, while academia lags behind the US substantially. <br>Chinese research papers have increased in quality rapidly over the years, but it will take a long time to catch up with the US. <br>(For more details on this, see my book AI Superpowers)<br><br>Deep learning is the single greatest invention so far in the Era of Discovery, which was led by the U.S.. <br>But since the deep learning breakthrough, we\'ve already entered the Era of Implementation where what matters is execution, product quality, speed, and data. <br>And that\'s where China comes in.<br><br>China\'s technological execution is built on incredible work ethic. <br>Nearly abandoning of my wife in the delivery room is nothing compared to the entrepreneurs in China. <br>As a venture capitalist in China, I once saw a startup claim that it offered great work-life balance because it was “996”. <br>What\'s 996? 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. <br>Most other startups in China are 997.<br><br>Chinese product quality has improved dramatically due to intense competition. <br>Silicon Valley competition resembles the old wars where each side takes its turn to fire. <br>In China, competition is like gladiators in the coliseum, fighting to the death with no holds barred. <br>Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product at lightning speed, and to develop impregnable business models. <br>As a result, Wechat and Weibo have evolved into arguably better products than products from Facebook and Twitter.<br><br>Chinese market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. <br>Just within the last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction tool, replacing cash and credit cards. <br>Total transaction in 2017 was $18.8 trillion, even larger than China\'s GDP. <br>How\'s that possible? China\'s mobile payments are built on the world\'s best infrastructure: nearly zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. <br>Over 700 million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline, loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a beggar.<br><br>All of this is amplified by China\'s enormous market size, which generates the treasure trove of data which is the critical rocket fuel for AI. <br>China\'s data edge is 3 times the US based on mobile users ratio, 10 times the US in food delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle rides. <br>(The few paragraphs above come from my TED talk this year).<br><br>All this rich data is used to make Chinese companies\' AI work better. <br>Today, China has the world\'s most valuable companies in computer vision, drones, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation. <br>The total valuation of Chinese computer vision companies is about $10B, and the total valuation of Chinese speech recognition companies is also about $10B.<br><br>Internet is an area where AI giants blossomed. <br>The same is true for US and China. <br>For US: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. <br>For China: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. <br>These seven companies have a disproportionate share of AI people (in particular Google has the most).<br><br>China has a number of industrial AI opportunities in “late mover advantage”, that is when the industry lags the US, AI can make a big difference. <br>We\'ve seen this in payments, and will soon see it in retail, healthcare, and education (for AI & education, watch the upcoming 60 Minutes).<br><br>So, not unexpectedly, in VC funding, China has 48% of the world\'s funding, while US 38%.<br>',
'<h2>Where is the end of the falling economy in China?</h2><br>There is no end because time doesn\'t end and China won\'t end.<br><br>Having said that, the Chinese government is using the downturn to prune back on companies which do not have bright futures, and is providing assistance to the industries which will be in demand in the future such as AI.<br><br>',
'<h2>Why is Germany more economically successful than Russia and Ukraine, despite the latter having more natural resources, fertile land, warmer climates and more youthful populations?</h2><br>Germany isn\'t actually that much more “successful” than Russia.

That said, Russia\'s advanced economy is so different from Germany\'s that it\'s not apparent to most observers. For example, unlike Germany, Russia designs and builds huge numbers of its own hi-tech aircraft, built entirely with Russian engines, propellers, avionics, and control systems.

'<h2><span class="orange">which city has the brightest future, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Shenzhen?</span></h2><br>Let me detour a little before going on topic.<br>I bet most people cannot find Guizhou on the map.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e9991e22f04a6c1b92987aecdbe86972"><br>It is one of China\'s poorer provinces, poorer than even Tibet.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-97c4174987dc872185652deb067bb576"><br>But interesting developments have been reported in Guizhou recently, including its newfound status as a data center hub, turning natural disadvantages into competitive leverage. Guizhou is well positioned to ride the big data wave in the coming decades.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2c6bb36fffbb3d8fc345c1446d397f75"><br>Guizhou is also home to the world\'s largest radio telescope, a 500m diameter behemoth that necessitated the creation of a 5km-wide radio-silent zone. Again, nicely played for an impoverished province.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d31ca01d954685282219932384e51b26"><br>Watch this man. Big data arrived in Guizhou during his term as governor. Good things seem to happen wherever Chen Min\'er goes so I\'m impatient to discover what he has in store for the 30m Chongqing residents living in the largest city proper worldwide.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0a7f1d70f2870352f40fc7384105ba9"><br>What does Guizhou have to do with the topic at hand, namely three prosperous coastal cities?<br>On the surface, not much, except I believe the big surprises will no longer be the exclusive domain of the advantageous coast but further inland as China transits into a consumption- and service-led economy from an export-driven one. China\'s connectivity has been upgraded at warp speed and this has dramatically equalized geographic disadvantage the interior has faced for millennia. There are plenty of low-hanging fruit ripe for picking just one or two provinces away from the coast.<br>If I were an investor, the inland belt is where I will focus on in the coming two or three decades.<br>Crystal ball gazing Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong is hard. The easy answer is Shanghai, because Shanghai may well be the best known Chinese city after Hong Kong from a cultural and international standpoint. She has the benefit of clear political direction, excellent infrastructure and societal order. The Free Trade Zone has been continuously expanding since initialization in 2013. Much of China\'s shipping will be funneled through Shanghai. She is already the world\'s busiest port.<br>Shanghai is already China\'s London or New York. It will overtake Hong Kong and Singapore as Asia\'s primary financial center when the internationalization of the Yuan is complete. The world\'s money will no longer flow through London and New York but also Shanghai, only it will be denominated in Yuan using alternatives to SWIFT, much like SEPA.<br>What counts against Shanghai is the argument it is already too big, and it grew too fast during the crazy 90s and 2000s. The excesses notwithstanding, changing needs made some investments look shortsighted, as relatively new infrastructure was repeatedly demolished to make way for even newer ones.<br>Shanghai\'s growth is being curtailed today by sky-high real estate, and traffic congestion. Thoughtful solutions are needed to temper more moderate growth with quality of life.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb55f020e816e7f1423c2d605f700336"><br>Shenzhen is today\'s China\'s tech center. Not so much software and design like Silicon Valley, but more next-gen hardware like drones, mobility scooters, IP cameras and medical devices.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d244ba3d9b314bfb224187de28958df"><br>Huawei recently opened a gorgeous 3.5 sq. mile campus in neighboring Dongguan, cementing Shenzhen\'s status as China\'s tech hub in the coming decades. World class designs will come out of Shenzhen, as it becomes a magnet for top-tier talent. Huawei is already offering CNY2+ million packages to freshly minted but exceptional PhD graduates.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-64b76166349759d3e8e687de53ef4b4a"><br>The recently opened Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge will further improve Shenzhen\'s connectivity, as travel times from Zhuhai to Shenzhen is cut by more than half. It will be interesting to follow the synergy that develop in the Pearl River Delta in the coming decades. Thankfully, pollution and congestion is less severe than Shanghai here.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a8bb1d5bbe8218d9f77530b9892edf6"><br>Finally, we come to the elephant in the room. Hong Kong deserves a section all on its own.<br>As a city that has been continuously developed for more than 150 years, Hong Kong has many more problems rooted in history. In recent decades, the poisoned chalice of democracy left by the British has crippled the city\'s governance. Lack of political leadership has prevented Hong Kong from implementing solutions to long term problems such as housing, education, and economic diversification.<br>Put simply, Hong Kong has been operating like a boxer with one hand tied behind his back. But amazingly, Hong Kong has done remarkably well post-handover, despite moderate population growth of 14%.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-589fc84435c6308e66826a5de240363b"><br>However, two decades after handover, we still see this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af0a78815c94af41edc0c962fab05709"><br>and this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22b990283783406ca57a648025758529"><br>and this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-43e742976f343735f69af3c3c95008cd"><br>In a city with nominal GDP per capita of US$48,000, one of the highest in Asia.<br>Prosperity mired in the incomprehensible.<br>The average Hong Kong youth, as the protests show, may be somewhat misguided. But make no mistake, Hong Kong\'s uber competitiveness has produced generation after generation of outsize talent. Let me quote George Yeo:<br><blockquote><i>Apart from the high politics, at the atomic level, we have good people who are responsible who care for one another, I think </i><b><i>upon these bricks you can build the most wonderful structures</i></b><i>. But if the bricks are weak or crumble, then however you try, however brilliant the architect, nothing much is going to come out of it. So when I look at Hong Kong, I said yes there are problems, and the future is uncertain, and many things are not within their control, but they have good people, strong people, and they will survive.</i></blockquote><br>If a crippled Hong Kong with intractable problems today can consistently grow at 3, 4 percent, driven by talented people who have always found solutions to stay afloat, what do you think will happen when Hong Kong frees herself from the shackles she has put on and begin to seriously tackle her varied problems? Hong Kong is still very far away from being a futuristic 21st century city, despite her wealth and prosperity.<br>A crippled Hong Kong has pockets of impressive excellence, finding many urban solutions to the world\'s densest population in many parts Kowloon and Hong Kong island.<br>What can an unencumbered people reimagine Hong Kong to be?<br>I may not live to see the day, but I hope Hong Kong grows up and claims her rightful spot as the jewel of the Pearl River Delta.<br>',
'<h2><span class="red">China and Iran flesh out strategic partnership</span></h2><br><img src="https://www.petroleum-economist.com/media/6837/tehran-mountains.jpg?mode=pad&width=1600&format=jpg&quality=90&slimmage=true&rnd=132119622720000000"><br><h3>Staggered 25-year deal could mark seismic shift in the global hydrocarbons sector</h3><br>Iran\'s foreign minister Mohammad Zarif paid a visit to his Chinese counterpart Wang Li at the end of August to present a road map for the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership, signed in 2016.<br>The updated agreement echoes many of the points contained in previous China-Iran accords, and already in the public domain. <br>However, many of the key specifics of this new understanding will not be released to the public, despite representing a potentially material shift to the global balance of the oil and gas sector, according to a senior source closely connected to Iran\'s petroleum ministry who spoke exclusively to <em>Petroleum Economist</em> in late August.<br>The central pillar of the new deal is that China will invest $280bn developing Iran\'s oil, gas and petrochemicals sectors. <br>This amount may be front-loaded into the first five-year period of the deal but the understanding is that further amounts will be available in every subsequent five-year period, subject to both parties\' agreement.<br>There will be another $120bn investment in upgrading Iran\'s transport and manufacturing infrastructure, which again can be front-loaded into the first five-year period and added to in each subsequent period should both parties agree.<br><h3>Chinese presence</h3><br>Among other benefits, Chinese companies will be given the first refusal to bid on any new, stalled or uncompleted oil and gasfield developments. <br>Chinese firms will also have first refusal on opportunities to become involved with any and all petchems projects in Iran, including the provision of technology, systems, process ingredients and personnel required to complete such projects.<br>"This will include up to 5,000 Chinese security personnel on the ground in Iran to protect Chinese projects, and there will be additional personnel and material available to protect the eventual transit of oil, gas and petchems supply from Iran to China, where necessary, including through the Persian Gulf," says the Iranian source.<br>"China will also be able to buy any and all oil, gas and petchems products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12pc to the six-month rolling mean price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6pc to 8pc of that metric for risk-adjusted compensation."<br>Under the terms of the new agreement, <em>Petroleum Economist</em> understands, China will be granted the right to delay payment for Iranian production up to two years. <br>China will also be able to pay in soft currencies that it has accrued from doing business in Africa and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) states, in addition to using renminbi should the need arise—meaning that no US dollars will be involved in these commodity transaction payments from China to Iran.<br>"Given the exchange rates involved in converting these soft currencies into hard currencies that Iran can obtain from its friendly Western banks—including Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank [in Germany], Oberbank [in Austria] and Halkbank [in Turkey]—China is looking at another 8-12pc discount [relative to the dollar price of the average benchmarks], which means a total discount of up to 32pc for China on all oil, gas and petchems purchases," the source says.<br>Another positive factor for China is that its close involvement in the build-out of Iran\'s manufacturing infrastructure will be entirely in line with its One Belt, One Road initiative. <br>China intends to utilise the low cost labour available in Iran to build factories, designed and overseen by large Chinese manufacturing companies, with identical specifications and operations to those in China, according to the Iranian source.<br><h3>Transport infrastructure</h3><br>The resulting products will be able to enter Western markets via routes built or enhanced by China\'s increasing involvement in Iran\'s transport infrastructure. <br>When the draft deal was presented in late August to Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei by Iran\'s vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri—and senior figures from the Economic and Finance Ministry, the Petroleum Ministry and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—he announced that Iran had signed a contract with China to implement a project to electrify the main 900km railway connecting Tehran to the north-eastern city of Mashhad. <br>Jahangiri added that there are also plans to establish a Tehran-Qom-Isfahan high-speed train line and to extend this upgraded network up to the north-west through Tabriz.<br>Tabriz, home to a number of key oil, gas and petchems sites, and the starting point for the Tabriz-Ankara gas pipeline, will be a pivot point of the 2,300km New Silk Road that links Urumqi (the capital of China\'s western Xinjiang Province) to Tehran, connecting Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan along the way, and then via Turkey into Europe, says the Iranian source.<br>The pipeline plan will require the co-operation of Russia, as it regards the FSU states as its backyard. <br>And, because, until recently, Russia was weighing a similarly all-encompassing standalone deal with Iran. <br>So, according to the source, the agreement includes a clause allowing at least one Russian company to have the option of being involved, also on discounted terms, alongside a Chinese operator.<br><h3>Benefits for Iran</h3><br>The Iranians expect three key positives from the 25-year deal, according to the source. <br>The first flows from China being one of just five countries to hold permanent member status on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). <br>Russia, tangentially included in the new deal, also holds a seat, alongside the US, the UK and France.<br>"In order to circumvent any further ramping up of sanctions—and over time encourage the US to come back to the negotiating table—Iran now has two out of five UNSC votes on its side. <br>The fact that [Iran foreign minister Mohammad] Zarif showed up unexpectedly at the G7 summit in August at the invitation of France may imply it has another permanent member on side," he adds.<br>A second Iranian positive is that the deal will allow it to finally expedite increases in oil and gas production from three of its key fields. <br>China has agreed to up the pace on its development of one of Iran\'s flagship gas field project, Phase 11 of the giant South Pars gas field (SP11). <br>China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of China\'s \'big three\' producers, added to its 30pc holding in the field when it took over Total\'s 50.1pc stake, following the French major\'s withdrawal in response to US sanctions. <br>CNPC had since made little progress developing SP11—a 30pc+ discount to the global market price on potential condensate and LNG exports could change that.<br>China has also agreed to increase production from Iran\'s West Karoun oil fields—including North Azadegan, operated by CNPC, and Yadavaran, operated by fellow \'big three\' firm Sinopec—by an additional 500,000bl/d by the end of 2020. <br>Iran hopes to increase projected recovery rates from these West Karoun fields, which it shares with neighbour Iraq, from a current 5pc of reserves in place to at least 25pc by the end of 2021 at the very latest. <br>"For every percentage point increase, the recoverable reserves figure would increase by 670mn bl, or around $34bn in revenues even with oil at $50/bl," the Iranian source says.<br>A final Iranian benefit is that China has agreed to increase imports of Iranian oil, in defiance of a US decision not to extend China\'s waiver on imports from Iran in May. <br>China\'s General Administration of Customs (GAC) figures released in late August show that, far from reducing its Iranian imports, China imported over 925,000bl/d from the country in July, up by 4.7pc month-on-month, from an already high base.<br>The actual figure is still higher, according to the Iranian source, with excess barrels being kept in floating storage in and around China; without having gone through customs they do not show up on customs data, but are effectively part of China\'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.<br>',

屈臣氏业务遍布24个国家/地区，共经营超过12000间零售商店<br>1985年，李嘉诚购入香港电灯集团34.6%股份，进入供电市场。至此，长实、和黄、港灯三家巨头公司尽归于李家门下。李嘉诚一手催动着烈火烹油的楼市，另一边将势力踏入地产、港口、零售、能源、通讯、医药等行业，组建起庞大的商业帝国。<br>白手起家的李嘉诚，成为笑傲香江的一代财富神话。<br><br>到90年代和本世纪初，李嘉诚拥有的私宅物业总量占到全港的1/7；和黄在香港葵涌港拥有12个泊位，处理着港口近一半的集装箱；和黄旗下的百佳超市占据着全港70%的零售超市份额......<br><br><img

香港码头业职工会总干事何伟航<br>是啊，李嘉诚确实是只想着赚钱，就像他自己说的那样：我是一个纯粹的商人，不要用空洞的道德来衡量我。因为他是商人，所以他的立场从来都是资本，他的目的也从来都是赚钱，至于用什么样的方式，这不重要。<br>任何方式，只要能赚到钱，在李嘉诚眼中就是好方式。<br>李嘉诚的组合拳：花式炒房+寡头垄断<br>李嘉诚最早进军房地产时采取的策略是：只租不售。相较于高风险高回报的预售楼花的方式，只租不售是一种更为稳妥保险的方式，但是这种方式的资金回笼实在太慢，而且也无力负担更大投入的项目。<br><br><img

香港楼价与租金齐飞<br>更何况低价买入需要勇气，高价卖出需要本事，房产开发也需要资本，这都是硬实力的一部分。但是随着手头的地皮越来越多，这样简单“质朴”的常规开发方式已经不能满足李嘉诚的需求了，他开始摸索<br><br>房产开发的“花式操作”。今年7月，港媒曝光长实持有的香港油塘东源街5及8号工业地将转为住宅用地，政府补价超过22.1亿港元，每平方英尺补价约5283港元（合每平方米超过58000港币）。这片地皮，长实持有已经超过二十年而未开发，转手一卖便是几十亿的收入，简单粗暴到连施工开发都省去了。<br><br>荒芜的土地，直接印出滚滚而来的钞票。<br><img

同样是实业出身的宗庆后否定李嘉诚<br>世界上最困难的事情是垄断，在任何一个市场中做成优势巨大寡头，都是凶险异常的九死一生，精明强干如<br><br>李嘉诚，从零开始建立自己的垄断帝国也用了将近半个世纪之久。而世界上最简单的事情也是垄断，垄断地位一旦建立，就可以毫不费力的以一己之力主宰整个市场环境，在整个垄断体系内，垄断者就是说一不二的王。<br>以和黄旗下的百佳超市为例，长期以最低的租金享受着长实提供的最佳地段，然后借用和黄的运输系统周转货物，这还不够，还要对新进入的同行设置极高的准入门槛，例如李嘉诚曾不让家乐福的运货车进入长江实业拥有的物业地区并打断水电供应，逼得家乐福连正常开店都困难。<br><br><img

'<h2><span class="white">What makes China greater than the United States of America?</span></h2><br>China is a <b>corporatist meritocratic technocracy </b>governed through a <b>one-party democracy</b>. The governing CCP is only Socialist on paper and only Communist by name. It does not truly espouse a particular ideology and has instead embraced a more pragmatic approach inherited from Confucianism.<br>The People\'s Republic of China practices <b>Democratic centralism.<br>Limited representative democracy:</b><br><ul><br><li>As required by the Chinese Constitution, Chinese citizens are granted the right to vote for their representatives on the local level. When it comes to holding office on a higher political level, one must first be nominated by officials holding lesser positions.</li><br><li>This cycle recurs over and over again as you move up the power ladder (indirect representation). In essence, all highly ranked officials are nominated by lower-rank representatives who have, in turn, been elected. This power ladder phenomenon grants them some legitimacy.</li><br></ul><br><b>The crucial role of THE party:</b><br><ul><br><li>Technically, being a CCP member is not required for one to hold any type of governmental position, nonetheless, an equivalent CCP rank to every position held in the government exists. Moreover, being part of the CCP will undoubtedly procure advantages and allow young minds to further their careers.</li><br></ul><br><b>Meritocracy vs kakistocracy:</b><br><ul><br><li>For one to be eligible for promotion, one must first prove one\'s merits as a statesman. This requires having successfully governed when holding a lesser position. Experience and past successes are fundamental if one wishes to climb up the power ladder.</li><br><li>Unlike in Democracy, the opinions of the ignorant, the inexperienced, and the uneducated are not allowed to contend with those of the knowledgeable and the capable. Possible errors performed by an amateurish electorate, taking the form of the election of ideologues or ineffectual representatives into office, are quick to be reversed based on concrete developments (not subjective public perception). Namely, the effects of the policies implemented by said statesmen.</li><br></ul><br><b>Cohesiveness:</b><br><ul><br><li>All high-ranking officials are technocrats specializing in a particular domain. None are politicians elected as a result of a popularity contest. Indeed, the main goal of a (Western) politician is nothing but reelection (politicians who truly operate out of conviction are rare and often ideologues) and the primary concern for any political opposition is to thwart the agenda of the governing party.</li><br><li>This creates never-ending disputes where nothing truly changes, in turn, showcasing the reasons behind the disparity in the rate of change between China and the West. A Chinese technocrat, on the other hand, specializes in a specific task (no confrontational stance) and aims to excel at it.</li><br></ul><br><b>Stability:</b><br><ul><br><li>The very nature of authoritarian rule prevents sudden political changes due to the caprices of the population (society is less prone to detrimental misinformation) and allows for long-term policies to be carried out. After all, democracy revolves around divisiveness and selfishness.</li><br><li>The average voter is fueled by self-interest, partisanship (just take a look at the US) and unable to look at the broader picture. This establishes China as one of the most reliable partners on the world stage by ascertaining Chinese commitment to the upholding of international agreements in front of all allies. This inherent authoritarian trait is perhaps the most notable given that it provides such countries with a precedent for trustworthiness.</li><br></ul><br><b>But let\'s be realistic, the Chinese system would certainly not be easy to successfully reproduce elsewhere.</b> All countries ought to implement a system that suits their needs (not frozen in time) and which accommodates their values all the while staying true to their history.<br>All governmental systems have their ups and downs but these depend on circumstances. When it comes to Trade War, The Chinese system is most desirable given its ability to withstand sudden changes to the <br><i><br>status quo<br></i><br> and its ability to react and adjust expeditiously without the need for consensus.<br>The worldwide neo-Liberal and American neo-Conservative quasi-religion of urging developing countries to embrace Liberal-Democracy as a universal system (despite blatant cultural and historical differences, and varying levels of development) has proven to be a monumental failure.<br><b>China has, by its relative success, proven to be more than an economic threat to Western hegemony (led by the US).

commonly believed by Historians that China took turns in being either one of the greatest or <i>the </i>greatest pre-eminent power of the world, leading Humanity\'s efforts in Science, Technology, Economy, Socio-Politics and Cultural Development.<br>Throughout history, China had already contributed countless eons worth of information and wisdom to the world, whilst simultaneously reinforcing this great cultural exchange with concrete acts of historical significance such as the invention of Paper, Gunpowder, Printing and the Compass.<br>Having the privilege of being a “River Valley Civilization” (of which there were only 3 others: Egypt, India and Mesopotamia/Iran-Iraq), this meant that China had the natural geographical advantages to begin a great civilization more powerful than any of its surrounding neighbours in every possible way.<br>The 4 “River Valley” Civilizations (arguably the greatest and earliest advanced Human societies to have ever existed aside from Greece, Rome and the “New World” Civilizations) sprung up around the following major rivers as illustrated below:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bfb4535c05babf54d2f12e9141dc87eb-c">Like its other River Valley peers, the soil around the Huang He (Yellow) River (the birthplace of Chinese Civilization) was blessed with immensely fertile soil. <br>Because of this, it allowed the early Chinese to quickly expand Agricultural production which inevitably led to an arguably linear increase in the population of the early Yellow River tribes. <br>At this time, there was no common culture or identity amongst these tribes, despite all living in such close proximity to each other.<br>And though the Yellow River was like a luminous Sun to which all intelligent life blossomed, there was a major catch.<br>Every so often the River flooded, and in the process it wiped away the crops and livelihoods of the people it also protected. <br>Such a tragic event soon proved useful however, faced with the prospect of imminent death, the Yellow River tribes decided to co-operate with each other and attempt to stop the flooding, or at least die trying. <br>The people of the various tribes agreed, and built canals in all the major rivers that were flooding to lead the water out to sea, a task which took 13 years to accomplish.<br>An artist\'s impression of Yu the Great\'s (the leader of the tribes) attempt to tame the Great Flood:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a4a45b562bc0780cfaa23a417c7e096f">Although the story of the “Great Flood” is sometimes considered to be a mere legend or even a myth, it is not unreasonable to assume its main point was not: that a great existential threat forced the tribes to finally co-operate as one. <br>That was what mattered, because in doing so the tribes begun to band together from that day onwards.<br>As a result of this, the tribes had finally formed a common culture and identity. <br>Thus, for the first time in her history, China became a single political entity in the form of a kingdom, led by a King.<br>This was the beginning of Chinese civilization as we know it.<br>As time passed, early Chinese civilization went through cycles of prosperity and decay. <br>Various Kings were in turn replaced by other more eager rulers, and in turn their kingdoms were also replaced by stronger kingdoms.<br>Such became the norm for hundreds of years until one day, something different occurred.<br>The Zhou Kingdom\'s (1046–771 BC) ruler had finally become too weak to maintain control over his vast domain. <br>Taking advantage of this weakness, the Dukes and Marquesses of the Zhou Dynasty seized their chance for power and begun making declarations of de facto (in reality) control over the regions their King had given them. <br>In doing so, the Zhou Kings only remained as symbolic rulers of the kingdom with mere nominal (existing only in name, not reality) control from 771 BC until 221 BC when the First Chinese Emperor unified China for the first time under the Qin Empire (221–206 BC).<br>But until the Qin, the map of China ended up looking like this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f2bf8babb8bbe7ba53bd6a58d38410ba-c">It was a land divided. <br>At the time, it seemed apparent that each kingdom was so evenly matched in strength and size that none could possibly have gained much from an invasion of another kingdom.<br><blockquote>And this is where most of Chinese Traditional Culture begun to take the final shape that can be experienced in China today, or anywhere with Chinese people really.<br></blockquote>For within this chaotic period of history called “The Warring States” period (the longest civil war in history lasting 254 years from 475–221 BC), a set of conditions came into being that eventually allowed a cultural revolution to occur.<br>We are talking about Feudal China here. <br>Imagine 254 years of constant war, fear, suffering, poverty, famine and the indiscriminate murder of innocents coupled with a lack of general morality and order. <br>Meanwhile, the Kings of various kingdoms were oblivious to the sufferings of innocent people, instead preferring to be entertained by dancing girls and court entertainers.<br>Whilst the powerless cried, those in power smirked with indifference. <br>This was the brutal reality which devoured China at the time, if you were anyone of “little” importance, chances are you would end up dead at one point or another, either killed in the army or killed by an invading army. <br>Life was generally very predictable: death by the sword or death in any other imaginable way.<br>It was from this dark, brutal reality that certain individuals were forced to come to prominence. <br>The most famous of these individuals was a government official called Kong Zi (Master Kong), or as he is known in the West today as: Confucius, who lived from 551 to 479 BC.<br>A statue of Confucius in China today:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ce5161746d75f94bdbff1d542d1cd132-c">Being a gentle soul, Confucius quickly became tired of all the death and suffering he saw around himself every day. <br>As a keen student of history, he knew however that life had not always been so bad. <br>Under the rule of the preceeding Zhou Kings, morality and order had not been so rare as it was in his days. <br>It was a time when the King was actually in charge, the poor did not starve, and murder was rare. <br>The people of the past were generally better off Confucius thought.<br>In his eyes, the solution was simple: make China great again by copying from the past. <br>However, it should be noted that Confucius himself had insisted that he wasn\'t an innovator, and that all of his teachings were merely rediscoveries of what had been true in the past. <br>Society was said to have deviated from an earlier Golden Age under the Zhou Kings, and it was his task to guide it back to its proper condition.<br><blockquote>“Confucius had no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be a prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; and flattered not the ruler under whom he lived.”<br>-Voltaire (1694–1778 AD), Leading Philosopher of the French Enlightenment Period (1715–89 AD)<br></blockquote>The geographic extent of the previous Zhou Dynasty:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df1a0e8af787fc64b5cdba972df0152c">Influenced by the values of the past, he begun to assert his teachings:<br><b>The first important Confucian value was “Societal Order”:</b><br>Confucius thought that when the Government was weak or divided, there could be no progress nor justice. <br>Whilst he was alive he observed correctly that China had no order, because there was no authority as the King was weak and incompetent, which allowed for his power to successfully be challenged by his own subjects, who took power for themselves.<br>Confucius concluded that a weak ruler could not enact change, even if he wanted to. <br>The real power to enact change was equally divided amongst several kingdoms, each with their own “King” and each claiming the right to rule China.<br><blockquote>“To put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must cultivate our personal life; and to cultivate our personal life, we must first set our hearts right.”<br>“Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son.”<br>-Confucius<br></blockquote><b>The second important Confucian value was “Hierarchical Reciprocity”:</b><br>Confucius did not believe it was possible for order to be achieved unless everyone first knew their place and role in society. <br>He thought that if everyone just did as they were supposed to, then all would be well. <br>It was deviations from the norm that made society more complicated than it had to be.<br>The King for example was supposed to rule, this much was simple. <br>What needlessly complicated things according to Confucius were the disobedient subjects who constantly challenged, rebelled, betrayed, disobeyed and eventually stole power from the King.<br>But it wasn\'t just royal authority in which he stressed hierarchy, he made it clear that hierarchy and respect for one\'s superiors was to apply to all sections of society.<br>Enter his assertion of the “Five Relationships”, a hierarchical model for society:<br><ol><li>Father to Child</li><li>Ruler to Subject</li><li>Husband to Wife</li><li>Older Brother to Younger Brother</li><li>Older Friend to Younger Friend</li></ol>It was a model for society. <br>Through it, Confucius stressed how interactions between the Five Relationships were to be carried out. <br>In each of these social relationships, Confucius stressed that one party was to be considered superior, and the other was to be considered inferior. <br>In this way, one was to submit to the other, and the other party in return was to lead the submitting party, thus bringing about order as well.<br>The Five Relationships:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4a0ec289a423ff86386ea3babd0762f5">But there\'s a catch, which of course there always is.<br>Confucius believed that relationships should be based on the righteousness of reciprocity, thus he commanded that though the superior parties were to assert their authority on the inferior parties, it had to be done with benevolence. <br>The leading side had to rule with righteousness, otherwise the inferior party did not have to listen to their superior counterparts. <br>In this way, Confucius was able to insist (long before the Spiderman movies came out): “With great power, comes great responsibility”.<br>Although those in power were to be fully respected, the inferior parties\' devotion had to be reciprocated by those who had authority, otherwise there could also be no order. <br>Risk requires a reward, “those who are being forced to bow down before their superiors could not be abused” Confucius insisted.<br>Expanding upon the model of the Five Relationships, Confucius connected this idea of hierarchical reciprocity back to an earlier idea which he recycled to strengthen and assert his teachings.<br>The idea was called the “Mandate of Heaven”, it stressed that the people were to remain the loyal subjects of whoever was in charge as long as and only as long as the ruler improved the lives of the people. <br>If the King was bad, it was believed that not only would the people suffer, but the Heavens and the Universe would show its displeasure at the King in the forms of natural disasters and famines. <br>This would then signal to the people that a new King was required, thus it was the duty of the people to overthrow the ruler, and replace him with a new one.<br>Although merely an idea, this concept was put into practice countless times throughout Chinese history, resulting in the rise and fall of numerous Chinese dynasties following a pattern as shown below:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-37c1a53f3348a62b85b6653268e218e0-c">In fact, governments were overthrown so often in Chinese history due to the Mandate of Heaven that a famous Chinese author (Luo Guanzhong) decided to introduce his equally renowned novel (Romance of the Three Kingdoms, published 1522 AD) with the following line:<br><blockquote>“The Empire long divided must unite, and long united must divide. <br>Thus it has always been.”<br><b>Author\'s comments:</b><br>Actually, it has just occurred to the author of this answer that Western Style Democracy also believes in the Chinese concept of the Mandate of Heaven. <br>The French Enlightenment Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–98 AD), a keen avid reader of Chinese philosophical texts was inspired by the Mandate of Heaven to such a degree, that he decided to just copy and paste these Confucian ideas into his new book titled “The Social Contract” (1762).<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6ed972a34b294f2e43db9f429c5f8e4b-c">His book insisted that there existed an invisible contract between a ruler and his people, and this contract only existed so long as the people were being looked after appropriately. <br>If not, then the Social Contract no longer existed, and the ruler was not a legitimate ruler anymore and needed to be overthrown.<br>After the French Revolution begun on the 14th July 1789, Rousseau\'s copied and pasted Chinese ideas were imprinted onto the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen” (1789, pictured below), France\'s first Constitution where the emanating ideas it stressed, eventually found their way all across Europe with Napoleon Bonaparte\'s Military Campaigns:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-98e347d4777d2ec358588286d0914616-c">In this way, the Mandate of Heaven found a secure place in Western Style Democracies, in Constitutional Monarchies and Republics alike even to this day.<br></blockquote><b>The third important Confucian value was “Harmonious Collectivism”:</b><br>Confucius did not consider the Warring States period in which he lived to be socially harmonious. <br>First he saw that there was no order, then he observed that there was no hierarchical reciprocity. <br>How then could the people ever trust each other enough as to work together, and enact positive change?<br>In Confucius\' mind, a human being was never metaphorically alone, every single action one carried out would affect those around them either positively or negatively, thus Individualism was redundant and counter-productive, and in his mind should be discouraged. <br>Individualism was unpredictable thus it was disapproved of by Confucius because solving the unpredictable is extremely difficult.<br>Thus he reasoned that one should strongly consider the consequences of their decisions, and think first before acting. <br>It was not possible to pursue Individualism, because the consequences of lacking a premeditated action he believed would severely undermine social harmony, and thus prevent the creation and maintenance of a perfectly harmonious society. <br>A harmonious society was the only way to progress Confucius argued. <br>Instead he stressed Collectivism, and working together.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6b0000135b5517bcabcc537b2465d289">Societal Order. <br>Hierarchical Reciprocity. <br>Harmonious Collectivism.<br>These are key Confucian values which just so happen to still exist in Modern China today. <br>Remember them please, we will be revisiting them in Chapter II and probably also Chapter III.<br><b>Traditional Chinese Culture in China today</b><br>Even in the last 100 years, the “Middle Kingdom” has seen much change. <br>Where there were once only fishing villages, there are now skyscrapers. <br>At the ports where there still used to be hundreds upon hundreds of wooden trading boats, now only modern steel ocean going ships dominate. <br>Where the skies once belonged to the various species of birds, today Helicopters and other Aircraft reign supreme. <br>On the roads of Beijing where most had to resort to walking, today cars are the dominant method of travel.<br>Here for example is Shanghai in 1920 and 2009. <br>Shanghai is of course one of the most developed cities on Mainland China today, so the disparities in the “then and now” photos are most evident. <br>However, my point is that a lot has changed in the last 100 years, this much is true as you can see:<br>Source: <span><a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/100-years-of-time-travelling-in-china-dheera-venkatraman/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">I Reshot

century as you can see. <br>100 years in this modern day and age of exponential technological advances, sees a lifetime of change in how things are done.<br>So then comes the obvious question:

land so there\'s that, Modern China only has 2/3 of the land she once had. <br>Neither does an Emperor rule over China anymore, so there\'s also that.<br>In addition, Chinese people don\'t look like this anymore:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4e7095729d04212a478dc17a730a69f8-c">So much as they actually look more like this nowadays:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e91a69f78caf420b103dd0628b5c04de">In this Age of Globalization, where Economists argue that the nations of the world are slowly coming together as one in order to create one Global Market, this has significant cultural implications. <br>As seen from the picture above, this is one such effect of Western led Globalization: Chinese adoption of Western clothing.<br>It doesn\'t stop there though, China has also adopted historical Western Architecture for some of her more important buildings like the “Shanghai Minhang People\'s Court”:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8ad1447593ad0f88f519b17c2f01bf7f">Neither does it stop there however, the “Golden Arch” is also becoming increasingly common in the Celestial Kingdom as well:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-085153da402b763245be38f0762a33a5">Here, there and everywhere it would seem that Western Culture, at the front of Globalization has overtaken Chinese Tradition and found a steady appreciation and support in China.<br>So would we be right then in saying that China is just another Western country?<br><b>No, absolutely not. <br>You would be extremely incorrect to believe that such is the case.</b><br>Yeah sure, if your definition of culture is defined by the superficial “look and see” aspects of a culture, then I would agree, it would of course appear that China is as “Modern” as any Advanced Western nation.<br>But what about the aspects which you cannot see? In other words, <b>what about the aspects of Chinese culture that</b> <b>define it the most?</b> The parts which are not so obvious? The non superficial aspects which give it its sense of depth and complexity reflecting thousands of years of continuous Chinese history?<br>For despite all the changes that have happened since Ancient China ended in 1912, such as the rejection of any aspects of Chinese Traditional Culture under the succeeding Republic of China (1912–49), Tradition has never really left the mindsets of the Chinese people even to this day.<br>No, Confucianism being a secular state sponsored philosophy for thousands of years since the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), has instead found its place secure in the cultural attitudes and mindsets of Chinese people even to this day, unchallenged by Western Social values and mindsets for an overwhelming part of the Chinese populace.<br>The Confucian ideas of Societal Order, Hierarchical Reciprocity and Harmonious Collectivism are still being practiced by the Chinese people all around the world today, and not just in China.<br>The special emphasis on the Extended Family (as opposed to “Nuclear” Family) is one such aspect. <br>For those of you unaware of the term Nuclear Family, it can be likened to the stereotypical family unit depicted by the “American Dream” of the 1950s, and includes mom, dad, and usually 3 kids. <br>The Chinese prize of the extended family however includes grandparents, uncle, aunties and cousins from both the mother and father\'s sides.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9fd0b1f419845413a1c5692b5c0fa764-c">For in China, respect for one\'s elders has never waned even for a mere second. <br>Respect and love for one\'s parents has never ceased either, yet like Confucius\' teachings this affection is not one sided. <br>Parents have often had to sacrifice much of their own personal happiness to ensure the happiness of their own children. <br>Sometimes, even divorces are deferred until a couple\'s children turn 18. <br>This of course allows there to be order and hierarchy yet benevolent reciprocity, just like Confucius wanted.<br>And what about Social Harmony? Well what about it? It hasn\'t gone anywhere either.<br>Ever heard of the term “saving face”? Well even to this day the Chinese people are extremely big on it. <br>For the sake of maintaining social harmony between multiple interacting parties, today in China it\'s an unwritten social etiquette, that certain incriminating aspects of a person should not be bluntly stated out loud, in full hearing distance of the public for it embarasses the person you have chosen to dishonour.<br>For this reason like Confucius once taught, it is better to maintain harmony lest one creates conflict and complicates a situation which should otherwise be uncomplicated.<br>As you can see, Traditional Chinese Culture has not gone anywhere. <br>It\'s still here, I cannot stress that enough. <br>It is still here, there and everywhere in China at any given time in any given person. <br>Make no mistake, at their base the Chinese have, are and will always be Chinese no matter what you may think or want to believe. <br>No amount of Globalization will change this fact.<br>Remember this for it will also come into my discussion in Chapters II and III.<br><hr><b>Chapter II: “A Clash of Civilizations”: Why Western Values Cannot Ever Work in Mainland China</b><br>In the same fashion, a square peg cannot fit into a round hole:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-59067ec121c16cfc9ed43f4aeedfdd05-c">The beauty of writing all these long answers on China, is that I keep getting constant motivation into having to always stay ahead of everyone else, by keeping up to date with current events on China daily.<br>It\'s simple. <br>Because my Lecturers are always so boring here is what I do instead: go onto Google, type in “China”, then press the “news” button. <br>Instantaneously, a plethora of articles on China quickly dominates my screen. <br>I then proceed to read all the articles that interest me. <br>Literally a true story, every sometimes.<br>But there is a downside to all this, the issue about Google is that it gives me a link to China related articles sourced primarily from formal and informal Western news websites.<br>By far the number one most common message in these articles is about how China needs to improve her “terrible” Human Rights record, or articles about how “Democracy” can be brought to China. <br>According to them, nothing about China is good, and everything is bad. <br>And when they\'re not writing about this, they\'re urging their audience into supporting Democracy movements all across China.<br>The Hong Kong “Umbrella Movement” in 2014 from what I remember was heavily supported by the majority of these Western Media News Outlets:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb19e979a7a86cf3df85a993674492df-c">Yet, the Umbrella Movement failed and the collapse of China never came, nor did Western Multi-Party Liberal Democracy ever come to China. <br>This was not an isolated incident however, for years Western experts on China have been predicting a political collapse, yet even to this day the People\'s Republic of China stands strong and prosperous under the authority of President Xi Jinping.<br>But why is this? Surely these Western experts with years of experience, study and analysis couldn\'t all be wrong on China am I right?<br>Well yeah, I am right actually and though I am no expert on China myself save for my Han Chinese ancestry and intimate knowledge of Chinese history and culture, I do however know enough to present my own “expert” assertion that:<br><b>Western Values cannot work in Mainland China because they contradict Chinese Cultural Values in every possible way, and at every possible turn.</b><br>From last Chapter, I told you to remember what the Confucian values were, but it\'s likely that you forgot so here they are again to refresh your memory:<br><ol><li>Societal Order</li><li>Hierarchical Reciprocity</li><li>Harmonious Collectivism</li></ol>From last Chapter, I also told you to remember (and proved) that Modern Chinese have not lost their Traditional Confucian mindsets despite decades of change and despite current ongoing Western led Globalization. <br>It\'s true, the Chinese people today are mostly as traditional as the Chinese of 1,000 years prior, albeit with some Western lifestyle cultural influences especially noticeable in the largest Chinese cities like Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and of course the former British colony of Hong Kong.<br>So then why can\'t Western solutions be used in China? Let\'s get started.<br><b>Firstly, from the perspective of Chinese people, Western Style Democracy does not promote the Confucian idea of Social Order.</b><br><blockquote>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”<br>-The Freedom of Assembly, First Amendment of the United States Constitution<br></blockquote>The 1st Amendment of the US Constitution asserts that all are free to protest whenever and wherever as long as their protests remain peaceful. <br>From a Western point of view this is a great idea. <br>From a Chinese point of view? A nightmare come true.<br>From a Chinese Cultural point of view, a protest no matter how peaceful is socially undesirable because it legalizes and encourages the action of venting your frustrations publicly and just generally making a nuisance for public order, forcing an unnecessary deployment of Law Enforcement officials to the areas of concern, and wasting time.<br>To the Chinese, a peaceful protest is already an unwarranted disruption of social order, a violent protest however takes it a step further, here is a protest “gone wrong” in the United States:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8fffb992c3f20f8ca3c55d23a951ae16-c">No matter how peaceful a protest may be, it is the violent and encouraged display of aggression that is extremely disapproved of by the Chinese people and thus can never be accepted no matter how much Western experts wish otherwise. <br>Confucius had also once advised against the extreme display of emotions which are sure to come about from a protest, and stressed everything in moderation instead.<br>Extreme displays of behaviour and emotion (such which is usually inevitable even in a peaceful protest with hundreds of other angry and similar minded people), is a huge no to Confucius and thus also the Chinese people today.<br>If you really wanted to advertise Western Style Democracy to China, I\'d personally start by removing the Right to Protest first. <br>Even peaceful protests violate and disrupt normal orderly society, they are not to be condoned in the eyes of Chinese people. <br>The West will not win any Chinese person over in this way except for the most Westernized Chinese individuals, especially those raised in Western countries.<br><b>Secondly, from the perspective of Chinese people, Western Style Democracy does not promote the Confucian idea of Hierarchical Reciprocity.</b><br><blockquote>“Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. <br>Social distinctions can be founded only on the common good.”<br>-Article I of The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, August 26th 1789<br>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.”<br>-Preamble of the United States Declaration of Independence, July 4th 1776<br></blockquote>The Signing of the Declaration of Independence by the Founding Fathers of the newly proclaimed United States of America on “Independence Day”, initially comprising of 13 states (colonies) on the Eastern Atlantic Coast:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00b91d8cf0e3a133a9d60d2007cbd73e-c">This point is more self-explanatory actually.<br>What happens when on one hand you have a culture that believes that all human beings are equal, and on the other hand you have one that believes in benevolent hierarchy?<br>You get a contradiction in cultural values leading to a Clash of Civilizations.<br>And this is exactly what has happened, and happens on a daily basis actually.<br>The issue is that Chinese Traditional Culture does not approve of equality, at least the kind that the West advocates. <br>Equality is an Egalitarian ideal and this is what makes it very distasteful to the Chinese people. <br>Egalitarianism is idealistic, Chinese Culture is not only not idealistic, but is extremely biased in favour of pragmatism.<br>In the eyes of the Chinese, Egalitarianism is impossible to achieve and is at best a good dream gone wrong much like Communism. <br>No, the age old Confucian emphasis on Hierarchy promotes authority thus order, and like I said before, it\'s not like this hierarchy has a one sided benefit. <br>The Confucian Hierarchy which is still embedded in the minds of Chinese people today, supports reciprocity which is why Chinese people see a Hierarchy as benevolent.<br>The issue is that Western experts do not even know that the Confucian idea of “Hierarchical Reciprocity” exists, let alone that it is still present in the mindsets and attitudes of Chinese people today.<br>Make no mistake, Confucian values are still very relevant to China even in this Modern day and age. <br>Here is a statue of Confucius at Wuhan University:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b8addcc5794dbb8e786ff2405c8d35f-c">The major problem with Egalitarian equality, and why it can never be accepted by the average Chinese person, is that Chinese Culture as stated before is extremely practical and believes in the age old belief of “if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it”.<br>The Chinese Values System of Confucian Hierarchical Reciprocity has already demonstrated for thousands of years that it works for China, thus why replace it with another foreign, contradictory and alien ideology with which the pragmatic Chinese people also have no experience with?<br>That is the real concern. <br>Based on this, I would say that this particular egalitarian Western value of equality is contradictory, non-pragmatic and thus incompatible as a replacement to Confucian Hierarchical Reciprocity.<br>Besides, China does not believe in Egalitarianism. <br>Instead China believes in Utilitarianism (doing the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people), the fact remains that Utilitarian Hierarchical Reciprocity in the case of China, is vastly superior as a tool to govern Pragmatic China successfully, than the Egalitarian and Idealistic Western Idea of Equality.<br><b>Thirdly, from the perspective of Chinese people, Western Style Democracy does not promote the Confucian idea of Harmonious Collectivism.</b><br>This is possibly the most obvious aspect for me to address.<br>It has been claimed that Western culture, especially Anglo-Western culture is Individualistic. <br>On the other hand, Chinese (and by extension East-Asian) culture is said to be Collectivistic.<br>The West generally places a higher emphasis on “finding yourself” and realising one\'s full potential, it stresses the power of one\'s ability to reach the pinnacle of their capabilities independent of external aid.<br>Chinese culture in contrast stresses the value of working together to accomplish goals as a team, this is not to say that there is no individualism, it\'s just that it\'s nowhere near as dominant.<br>Here\'s a quick summary of the differences between Individualism and Collectivism:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c2a4155a589351f9453f1084a5a2b25b"><blockquote><b>Author\'s comments: </b>The image above is not completely accurate however, despite being born into a Collectivist culture, I for example actually intensely hate group work and the only thing I ever learn from working with others, is actually just how much I hate other people. <br>Sad, but true. <br>But in general, the image is accurate.<br></blockquote>This distinction between Chinese Collectivism and Western Individualism is crucial, since I strongly suspect that Western Liberal Democracy was first designed during the Age of Revolutions, with no specific intentions for its “exporting”. <br>In other words, Western Democracy was only made as a response to the contemporary issues of the West exclusively for Western benefit.<br>Regardless of what Western experts and “experts” claim, the fact remains that Western Democracy was never intended to be made for foreign adoption. <br>The beauty of this unique style of governance was that it was not only just made in order to protect the Western notion of individualism, it was made to address the specific historic circumstances of the West, circumstances which did not exist in contemporary China, or at least had not for hundreds of years by that time.<br><b>What exactly do I mean when I talk about the “unique situation” of the West?</b><br>To answer this, let\'s return to Bourbon France (1589–1830 AD) shortly before the French Revolution in July 1789.<br>The great sorrow of Bourbon France could be ascribed to two major factors:<br><ul><li>The unwarranted, non-secular and ever encroaching interference of the Catholic Church in French Domestic Affairs</li><li>The unlimited God given power of Louis XVI: the “Divine Right of Kings”</li></ul>Louis XVI, the last King of France before the French Revolution:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9c48b57bdd2bae0bc0b318adb7333337-c">Because of the sorrows inflicted under the “Ancien Regime” (French for Old Regime) and Catholic Church, certain individuals (much like Confucius in the Warring States Period) were also forced to come forth. <br>The two most notable individuals were the French Philosophers of the Enlightenment Period (1715–89 AD); Voltaire (1694–1778 AD) and his rival Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–98 AD).<br>Voltaire hated the Catholic Church\'s involvement in his country and wanted a secular France. <br>Meanwhile Rousseau hated the concept of an Absolute Monarchy and wanted the “Separation of Powers”.<br>It was from this hatred of the old ways, ways which were unique to France and did not exist in China, that the Democratic ideals of Freedom of Religion and Separation of Church and State was first proposed by Voltaire in his book “Dictionnaire Philosophique” (1764).<br>Voltaire\'s book advocating Secularism:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3557f07ad6d234300cbf8c98659de65a-c">Meanwhile, the idea of the Separation of Government into three different and independent political bodies: a Legislature, an Executive and Judiciary was proposed by Rousseau in his book, “The Social Contract” (1762) as I previously mentioned. <br>It was made as an answer in response to what he considered to be the barbaric and outdated notion of the Divine Right of Kings (meaning God has put me in charge, thus I am King and none can challenge my authority).<br>Separation of powers in the United States today:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e90d3ca24fda010db3a7eb54113992dd-c">In this manner, hundreds upon hundreds of Western Democratic ideals, which today provide the backbone to Western Multi-Party Liberal Democracy, were formed from the unique circumstances of the West as I had previously claimed.<br>Now this is a very crucial point here. <br>Let\'s quickly recap what I said first, Western Democracy was made for the West to protect the core Western value of Individualism, it was also made in response to consequences arising from the unique situation of the West: Absolute Monarchy and Catholic Non-Secularism, both of which threatened individualism.<br>Because of Voltaire and Rousseau\'s efforts, France entered revolutionary mode, here is an artist\'s impression of the “Tennis Court Oath” (June 20th 1789), 24 days before the French Revolution begun, under the banner of “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité” (Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood), the revolutionaries swore to never separate until they had given France a Constitution, a pledge which was fulfilled merely months after:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f3dc00e37679b1036b292c787b0e00aa-c">This is how and why Western Democracy became an effective solution for the Western World even to this day, because it protects the individual, and this resonates highly with each Westerner\'s beliefs and values.<br><b>Now let\'s talk about China, I want to show you why Western Democracy cannot work for Collectivist China like it did for the Individualist West.</b><br>The simple answer is that there has never been such thing as a Catholic Church in China. <br>China in fact didn\'t have any Religions native to it, Confucianism and Taoism were only Philosophies, and innately secular ones at that.<br>And what of an Absolute Monarchy? No, not that either. <br>For thousands of years, China was indeed a land ruled by the absolute control of the King. <br>But that changed 2,000 years ago under the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) who reformed Monarchical Totalitarianism and instituted a new form of government, one which was only abandoned 100 years ago with the end of the China\'s last Imperial Dynasty, the Qing (1644–1912 AD).<br>The new system of governance was “Meritocracy”, government officials who helped the Emperor run the country were chosen through Meritocratic Examinations, the likes of which you can see here from this painting of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD) Examinations:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f923cb11c9057f844c88a0a77a812e09-c">There were no checks and balances in a Western Democratic fashion but the Mandate of Heaven (as I mentioned back in Chapter I, which Rousseau copied) ensured that a ruler could not abuse his power unlike in Bourbon France. <br>In this way, there was never an incentive for Western Style political reform in China, because Chinese culture and people were and still are a viciously pragmatic one which subscribe to the belief of:<br><blockquote>“If it isn\'t broken, don\'t bother fixing it”<br></blockquote>And because China didn\'t have the same problems as the West, it never needed to develop Western Style Democracy… and if China didn\'t need to borrow the West\'s system of Government even back then… why would you even think China could use it now? Have I been living under a rock or something whilst there was some huge change? No, I don\'t believe so, not the slightest. <br>Little has changed.<br>How is it possible for Individualist oriented Western Democracy to successfully rule over a vast Collectivist and Hierarchical nation of 1.4 billion souls? No, you can\'t. <br>Western Democracy cannot ever work for China because it was only designed for Europe and the West. <br>A round peg cannot fit into a square hole, and vice-versa.<br>Don\'t be so arrogant as to suggest otherwise, China can never adopt Western Democracy, and that is good, no, great news. <br>Likewise, the West can not and will never adopt China\'s Political System, and that is also great news. <br>Each civilization must find their own destiny, instead of blindly copying others or worse, being bullied into copying others.<br><hr><b>Chapter III: “My Way or the Highway”: Socio-Political Innovation in the Middle Kingdom</b><br>It was 2005 when I first heard about the “Made in China” stereotype. <br>Because I was just a kid, I couldn\'t fully comprehend just how offensive it was until a couple of months afterwards.<br>My friend had just bought a new pencil case which was refusing to work properly as intended.<br>“My dad told me that anything that was Made in China would break down in a couple of minutes” Stephen said, pausing to look at me with a grimace, “well it looks like he was right I guess.”<br>Perhaps you\'ve heard of this stereotype and even joked about it yourself quite a few times. <br>The stereotype was intended to mock China\'s manufacturing capabilities, at the time China had not yet been so keen to innovate like today, instead it was hell bent on copying everything from the West, giving rise to another stereotype:<br>“China cannot innovate, all China can do is copy others.”<br>Regardless of whether this stereotype is true or not, here is China\'s planned future spending on Research and Development:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c4e9b3b5dfd2d0d48021b0057f1362a2">It\'s actually not very funny, not even the slightest bit. <br>It\'s really just extremely rude and equally offensive as such.<br><b>But do you know what is even less funnier than that extremely unnecessary stereotype?</b><br>The one where Western experts, and non-experts alike insist that China needs to adopt (read: <b>copy</b>) the Democracies of the West and implement a Western Style Liberal Democracy in China.<br>Why is this less funny? Is it because I don\'t have a sense of humour?<br>Maybe, but mainly because they are recommending that China <b>copies</b> from them. <br>Funny isn\'t it? They want China to copy them and then make fun of her for not knowing how to innovate and only knowing how to copy from them.<br>Regardless, the Western experts on China cannot possibly be that knowledgeable on the Middle Kingdom because they\'ve overlooked a massive Chinese feat of innovation, in a time when China genuinely “could not” innovate.<br>In fact, China\'s current Political System is a unique innovation by China, that hasn\'t been copied from anywhere actually.<br>In striving to be unique once more, to be different from the West which has ruled the world for the last 300 years in the absence of China, the Chinese have created a unique political model which is non-democratic yet one which works exceptionally well for China, because like how Democracy was made with Western history and Individualist values in mind, the “Chinese Model” is engineered specifically for China\'s unique historical circumstance and Collectivist values.<br><blockquote><b>As a side note</b>, China\'s Economy which is also unique and different from Western Economies is being studied by Quora\'s own George Tait Edwards who is currently attempting to study the unique features of the Chinese Economic Model at a formal, Academic level via a Ph.D. <br>I would strongly suggest visiting his profile for more information on China\' unique Economic Model.<br></blockquote>The truth is, it is China\'s Political Model, a specially designed and specifically engineered system which fits China the best and not Western Style Liberal Democracy with which Chinese culture is incompatible with. <br>China\'s Political System is the only model which is appropriate for it, much like how Western Democracy is the only Political System appropriate for the West.<br>Under the Chinese Model, one of its redeeming features is efficiency.<br>Below is the “Three Gorges Dam”:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4b7905e31018a39975c52e503c24b1e5-c">Some facts first:<br><ul><li>One of the Great Modern Wonders of China</li><li>It cost $37 Billion Australian (2010) to build which is <b>$28 Billion </b>US (2017)</li><li>For it to be built, <b>1.3 million</b> people were relocated, 13 cities and 140 towns and 1600 villages are now under the water that it holds</li><li>Generates <b>11 times</b> as much power as the Hoover Dam in the United States</li><li><b>45 Billion cubic metres</b> of water are drawn <b>1600 kilometres</b> each year</li><li>It was <b>specifically designed</b> to help Northern China and Western China\'s ongoing issues of Drought and Desertification respectively</li></ul><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0af09ffc472fc75e043d48d9b308d344-c">This is just one of many examples that show the fast implementation of projects in China that were designed in thinking with Chinese long term oriented culture to combat Desertification and Drought. <br>Efficiency and pragmatism which is highly prized in China and Chinese culture, has been exemplified by the Chinese Model.<br>I don\'t want to point any fingers here, but in a US or UK style Democracy it is difficult to see this happening in such a small time span, with so much controversy that would surely arise from relocating 1.3 million people, an act which contradicts the Western value of Individualism, yet conforms to the Chinese ideal of Collectivism.<br>In addition, contrary to popular belief, “oppressive” as the Chinese Government seems, why then have the Chinese not overthrown the Chinese Communist Party? Surely in a country of 1.4 billion people, you\'d expect the heavily discontented Chinese people (as Western Media claims) to surely be planning to overthrow the Chinese Government? Yet, China still stands strong and once again any Western expert\'s numerous “doomsday prophecies” have not come true despite predicting China\'s demise for over 30 years now.<br>The National People\'s Congress assembled in the People\'s Republic of China:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a4f944b951f30899ac8ba23a46c62937-c">No, in fact the Confucian idea of the “Mandate of Heaven” which I introduced back in Chapter I (and told you to remember, but you haven\'t) is already strongly embedded in the populace. <br>If the Government as asserted by Confucius stops reciprocating the devotion of the people, then they would have considered to have lost the Mandate of Heaven. <br>Then and only then, with such discontent would the government have been overthrown.<br>Do not believe either that the Chinese people are too “cowardly” to stand up to their government. <br>That would not even be close to the truth believe me. <br>For like I said earlier, hundreds of governments of the various Ancient Chinese dynasties have already been overthrown by the people when they abused their power, disregarding the Mandate of Heaven and Confucius\' teachings. <br>Do not believe even for a moment, that Chinese people will not fight for themselves and overthrow an unrighteous and evil government, but yet they have not.<br>Even to this day both the People\'s Republic of China and the Chinese Government stand strong, implying that the Chinese people are satisfied with their “evil” (only from a Western point of view) government. <br>Do not believe even for a mere second that China\'s situation regarding people\'s satisfaction is so delicate that it is on the verge of revolution. <br>Because believe me, if all the stuff that CNN, Fox News or even Buzzfeed says about China was true, China would have gone through 10,000 revolutions by now.<br><blockquote><b>Author\'s comments:</b><br>It\'s really funny though, no matter how much China improves there will always be the “China Haters”. <br>These are the people who made fun of China for not being able to innovate and only being able to copy, yet they simultaneously mock her for the lacking presence of Western Democracy, and insist that China needs to copy the West.<br>Funny isn\'t it? Which one would they like China to do: be original or copy? Believe me, they\'re literally complete opposites.<br>These “China Deniers” need to come to a common consensus on what they want because in no way will Chinese people ever take them seriously otherwise (they wouldn\'t anyway actually). <br>Just my advice, take it or leave it.<br></blockquote><hr><b>Final Summary</b><br><blockquote><b>Author\'s Gratitudes: </b>Before I conclude, I\'d just like to say thank you for reading, it\'s been such a long journey and I hope I was able to teach you all something. <br>It\'s been a pleasure, thank you for giving up your precious spare time to read my probably boring and or annoying answer. <br>You are the best, it is for you that I willingly labour for such a huge amount of time to bring you these answers. <br>Thank you for all your support!! ^-^<br></blockquote>Chinese culture is a very unique accumulation of thousands of years of refinement. <br>When China was but a land divided, devoid of morals, a man known in the West today by the name of Confucius gave China one of the greatest contributions possible in all of Chinese History: the ideology of Confucianism. <br>Confucianism stressed the 3 major ideas which though he did not invent, were derived from the past during the Zhou Dynasty, a time he considered to be an appropriate role model for the China of his time, which was an extremely horrible place to live in.<br>The 3 key values were:<br><ol><li>Societal Order</li><li>Hierarchical Reciprocity</li><li>Harmonious Collectivism</li></ol>These key values are present even in Modern China today in the mindsets and attitudes of Modern Chinese people.<br>Naturally, to successfully convince the Chinese people to “convert” to Western Style Multi-Party Liberal Democracy, Western Values would first have to win over the Chinese people.<br>Yet because Western Democratic Values are so different from China\'s core values, this is impossible. <br>Western Democracy does not agree with the Chinese value of Societal Order. <br>It promotes protesting which in fact specifically disrupts the natural peace that Chinese people so desire.<br>Western Democratic Values stress equality, yet the pragmatic Chinese people are unmoved because they consider it much inferior to reality and the much greater Confucian value of Hierarchical Reciprocity. <br>This value was pratical, realistic and one where the Chinese had already been used to it for thousands of years. <br>It was also Utilitarian and did the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people, unlike the idealistic and egalitarian Western value of Equality, which whilst great is impossible to achieve at least in the 21st Century.<br>In addition, Individualistic Western Democratic values which were made in specific response to historic Western circumstances (which were unique to the West and did not exist in China) cannot solve Chinese problems as the issues of China are different to the issues of the West today and yesterday, as most of these issues historic or otherwise are non-mutually shared. <br>What China needs is a Chinese focused, Collectivist oriented political system, otherwise Western Democracy is no such solution and of course Chinese culture would be incompatible with this exclusive version of Democracy.<br>Today, the People\'s Republic of China runs such a unique system of government, built with Chinese values in mind and constructed specifically in response to China\'s historic circumstances (the likes which also did not exist in the West), thus China is on the right path. <br>Pragmatic China should not fix what hasn\'t been broken, and the Chinese System though flawed is the best hope for a secure and bright China, and not Western Democracy.<br>Any Western expert or Western “China Denier” claiming otherwise needs to tone down on the arrogance, come to grips with reality and examine the facts, facts which are indisputable and self-evident, facts which I have spent over 8,300 words trying to explain in precise detail.<br><b>No, the truth is simple: China must forge her own destiny.</b><br>',
