'<h2>acceleration rate vs growth, debt</h2><br>They are different things.<br><br>6.5% is a ratio expressing the rate of acceleration, not growth. <br><br>Knowing a ratio, like 6.5%, tells you nothing about growth unless you know what to multiply it with. <br>Growth is a value derived by multiplying the rate of acceleration with the previous year\'s GDP and is expressed in RMB or $. <br><br>Growth $ = Annual GDP $ x Rate of acceleration.<br><br>In 2006, China\'s economy was $7.6 trillion. <br>Growing at 12%, it added $761 billion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $761 billion. <br>[7.6 x 1.12B]<br><br>In 2016, China\'s economy was $21.1 trillion. <br>Growing at 6.7%, it added $1.3 trillion that year. <br>Therefore, growth = $1.3 trillion [1.06 = $1.27T].<br><br>So China\'s economy is not slowing down, it is speeding up.<br><br>What about debt? <br>We are often told that China\'s indebtedness is serious but not about China\'s assets. <br>How do China\'s assets compare to its debt? <br>In other words, how easy is it for China to pay its debts? <br>Here are two charts that give you some idea. <br><br>We are told that all debt (all Chinese debt?) is bad, but this is nonsense. <br>The entire world\'s economy runs on debt. U.S. Treasury Bonds are pure debt. <br>Even currency is a form of debt.<br><br>What\'s not discussed is the quality of the debt: will the debt-holder be repaid? <br>Will she receive the promised interest payments regularly for the life of the debt? <br>Will the final value of the debt, after adjusting for inflation, make the investment worthwhile?<br><br>Happily, Chinese government debt is of high quality, partly because the Chinese government has access to the safest, most lucrative investment opportunities and can, in a sense, guarantee them because it owns the underlying assets. <br>When it builds a new high speed rail line, for example, it owns the land around the new railway stops and can develop the land very profitably. <br>The cash flow from that development then goes to paying off the debt–usually in 15 years. <br>The St Louis Federal Reserve was curious and published a draft report, Is Government Spending a Free Lunch? <br>Evidence from China, saying that Chinese government investments yields a Keynesian multiplier of between two and three (compared to America\'s 0.9.), so there\'s room for more profitable investment.<br><br>Another factor that China alarmists overlook is growth. <br><br>If you know your wages will double in the next ten years, you can afford a bigger mortgage or higher car payments because you\'ll have more money to repay the debt. <br>China\'s economy has doubled every ten years for the past 40 years and, at that rate, it will be easier for China to repay its debts than for any country on earth. <br>',
'<h2>If the USA embargoed China</h2><br>The US embargoed China before, for 20+ years. <br>The result is that today, China is the most embargo-resistant country in the world by far. <br>There is no other country, not the US, not Russia, as embargo-resistant as China.<br><br>The US, EU, and Japan implemented the most thorough economic embargo on China at the start of the Korean War, which covered over 400 classes of products, including farm, fish and forestry products, fertilizers, coal, chemicals and metals, passenger cars, agricultural, industrial and office equipment and certain electronic and communications equipment. <br>Trains and airplanes belonged to the "don\'t even think about it" categories. <br>The embargo lasted from 1950 - 1971. <br>It taught China a lesson - whatever you don\'t make, you don\'t have. <br><br>U.S. Ends Ban on China Trade<br>If you want to know how big a lesson China had learned, just look at this chart below:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c59a6864c5c8ef2eace19b72b06c52a"><br>This is the wheat yield per hectare in China. <br>Agricultural yield depends on three factors: irrigation, seed, fertilizer. <br>China had irrigation and seed, but fertilizer was embargoed. <br>In 1949 the yield was about 600 kg/hectare, and according to the US ambassador at that time, 3 - 7 million people in China starved to death every year before 1949. <br>It was basically subsistence-level farming. <br>The famous "Great Leap Forward" in 1958 - 1961 caused the little dip in yield you see on the graph from 1958 - 1961, which people blamed it on Mao\'s wrong agriculture policy. <br>Just a little dip, and mass starvation was the result. <br>But once the embargo lifted in 1971 and fertilizers started flowing into China, the wheat yield experienced a 5-fold increase, from 600 kg/hectare to 3200 kg/hectare! Yeah, if the fertilizer had started flowing in earlier, China would not have been nearly so fragile that any policy mistake leads to mass starvation. <br>But when fertilizer is embargoed, and you don\'t know how to make it yourself, well, you get to starve.<br>The one country who helped China the most at that time was Russia. <br>Russia probably won\'t do so ever again, but back then it was a communist country and actually believed in just giving technologies to fellow communist countries for free. <br>A lot of countries got their domestic industries started this way, but China, despite the fact that most of the population were illiterate, turned out to have benefited the most . <br>Russia transferred 156 complete industrial lines to China in the 50\'s and 60\'s, including coal, iron, engine, tire, tooling, fertilizer, etc. <br>Almost all of them are heavy industries that are out of date by now, but it\'s like somebody has to move from elementary school to middle school to high school to university - without this transition, the Chinese would have a really hard time catching on to the more advanced technologies later. <br>The Russians were really good - taught the Chinese hand-by-hand every step of the way.<br>Many people believed that was the result of the "trust-building exercise" of the Korean War, where over 200,000 Chinese lost their lives. <br>This was the beginning of transforming China from a poor starving farm to a huge profitable factory. <br>Then as soon as the embargo was lifted, the Chinese government in the 70\'s spent a lot of money to buy technology from Germany, France, Japan, and the other Western countries, and started building their own chemical and transportation industries from scratch. <br>20 years later, China had enough industrial knowledge to be able to reverse-engineer most of the stuff she ever laid her eyes on. <br>The "market for technology" strategy later on, when the Chinese market grew big enough to be attractive, also helped moving a lot of production to China.<br>With the fall of USSR in the 90\'s, the US and her allies started the "globalization", basically move the low-margin businesses out of the country and keep the high-margin businesses (like finance, etc.) in. <br>Well, China has a different take on this. <br>After all, it\'s the country that has been put under the most extreme embargo for over 20 years. <br>She doesn\'t care about money as much as whether she gets to have the stuff, because if there is any disturbance in the normal functioning market, you can have money but nowhere to buy the stuff. <br>So she jumped enthusiastically onto the globalization bandwagon and yelled, "come, globalized your stuff to me! I\'ll make it cheaply for you!"<br>Before the 90\'s, the US, USSR, and China were the only 3 countries who had the industrial infrastructure to make stuff from scratch (ores, coal, petroleum, rubber) to finished products. <br>Then USSR imploded and the US globalized. <br>Now, China is the only one who can make 90% of all the world products from scratch to finish. <br>It\'s the most self-sufficient country in the world.<br>So now, if you put China under embargo again, the quality of life in China should by-and-large be ok, but it\'s probably going to be a very fast way to put the brakes on 100% of global industries. <br>The "made-in China" stuff is actually the smaller concern. <br>I bet every industry will have at least some parts/tooling that are imported from China. <br>Remember for a complex system with hundreds of components, it takes only one critical components missing to stop the whole production. <br>You can replace them, but it\'s going to take time, and it may require developing additional technology and industry know-how to get there. <br>In the meantime, everything is going to grind to a halt waiting for parts.<br>China exports $2.3 trillions worth of products a year. <br>20% to the US, 20% to EU, and the rest goes to the third-world countries in every continent. <br>There are over 100 US banks and tens of thousands of US-China joint venture companies in China. <br>Conversely, there are tons of Chinese companies in every continent as well. <br>A US embargo of China is frankly unthinkable, because it would hurt every single country on earth. <br>On the other hand, when all countries work together, everybody makes money together. <br>This is the whole point of globalization, isn\'t it, that everyone will be dependent on each other and thus all of us will have the incentive to maintain the peace?',
'<h2>AI in China compared to the U.S.</h2><br>A major difference between US AI and China AI is that China AI is all about implementation.<br><br>In research, US has about 60% of the world\'s top 1000 top researchers, and China less than 10%. <br>The top US researchers are both academia and industry, while the top Chinese researchers are generally in the industry, while academia lags behind the US substantially. <br>Chinese research papers have increased in quality rapidly over the years, but it will take a long time to catch up with the US. <br>(For more details on this, see my book AI Superpowers)<br><br>Deep learning is the single greatest invention so far in the Era of Discovery, which was led by the U.S.. <br>But since the deep learning breakthrough, we\'ve already entered the Era of Implementation where what matters is execution, product quality, speed, and data. <br>And that\'s where China comes in.<br><br>China\'s technological execution is built on incredible work ethic. <br>Nearly abandoning of my wife in the delivery room is nothing compared to the entrepreneurs in China. <br>As a venture capitalist in China, I once saw a startup claim that it offered great work-life balance because it was “996”. <br>What\'s 996? 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. <br>Most other startups in China are 997.<br><br>Chinese product quality has improved dramatically due to intense competition. <br>Silicon Valley competition resembles the old wars where each side takes its turn to fire. <br>In China, competition is like gladiators in the coliseum, fighting to the death with no holds barred. <br>Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product at lightning speed, and to develop impregnable business models. <br>As a result, Wechat and Weibo have evolved into arguably better products than products from Facebook and Twitter.<br><br>Chinese market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. <br>Just within the last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction tool, replacing cash and credit cards. <br>Total transaction in 2017 was $18.8 trillion, even larger than China\'s GDP. <br>How\'s that possible? China\'s mobile payments are built on the world\'s best infrastructure: nearly zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. <br>Over 700 million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline, loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a beggar.<br><br>All of this is amplified by China\'s enormous market size, which generates the treasure trove of data which is the critical rocket fuel for AI. <br>China\'s data edge is 3 times the US based on mobile users ratio, 10 times the US in food delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle rides. <br>(The few paragraphs above come from my TED talk this year).<br><br>All this rich data is used to make Chinese companies\' AI work better. <br>Today, China has the world\'s most valuable companies in computer vision, drones, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation. <br>The total valuation of Chinese computer vision companies is about $10B, and the total valuation of Chinese speech recognition companies is also about $10B.<br><br>Internet is an area where AI giants blossomed. <br>The same is true for US and China. <br>For US: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. <br>For China: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. <br>These seven companies have a disproportionate share of AI people (in particular Google has the most).<br><br>China has a number of industrial AI opportunities in “late mover advantage”, that is when the industry lags the US, AI can make a big difference. <br>We\'ve seen this in payments, and will soon see it in retail, healthcare, and education (for AI & education, watch the upcoming 60 Minutes).<br><br>So, not unexpectedly, in VC funding, China has 48% of the world\'s funding, while US 38%.<br>',
'<h2>Where is the end of the falling economy in China?</h2><br>There is no end because time doesn\'t end and China won\'t end.<br><br>Having said that, the Chinese government is using the downturn to prune back on companies which do not have bright futures, and is providing assistance to the industries which will be in demand in the future such as AI.<br><br>',
'<h2>Why is Germany more economically successful than Russia and Ukraine, despite the latter having more natural resources, fertile land, warmer climates and more youthful populations?</h2><br>Germany isn’t actually that much more “successful” than Russia.

That said, Russia’s advanced economy is so different from Germany’s that it’s not apparent to most observers. For example, unlike Germany, Russia designs and builds huge numbers of its own hi-tech aircraft, built entirely with Russian engines, propellers, avionics, and control systems.

'<h2><span class="orange">which city has the brightest future, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Shenzhen?</span></h2><br>Let me detour a little before going on topic.<br>I bet most people cannot find Guizhou on the map.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e9991e22f04a6c1b92987aecdbe86972"><br>It is one of China’s poorer provinces, poorer than even Tibet.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-97c4174987dc872185652deb067bb576"><br>But interesting developments have been reported in Guizhou recently, including its newfound status as a data center hub, turning natural disadvantages into competitive leverage. Guizhou is well positioned to ride the big data wave in the coming decades.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2c6bb36fffbb3d8fc345c1446d397f75"><br>Guizhou is also home to the world’s largest radio telescope, a 500m diameter behemoth that necessitated the creation of a 5km-wide radio-silent zone. Again, nicely played for an impoverished province.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d31ca01d954685282219932384e51b26"><br>Watch this man. Big data arrived in Guizhou during his term as governor. Good things seem to happen wherever Chen Min’er goes so I’m impatient to discover what he has in store for the 30m Chongqing residents living in the largest city proper worldwide.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0a7f1d70f2870352f40fc7384105ba9"><br>What does Guizhou have to do with the topic at hand, namely three prosperous coastal cities?<br>On the surface, not much, except I believe the big surprises will no longer be the exclusive domain of the advantageous coast but further inland as China transits into a consumption- and service-led economy from an export-driven one. China’s connectivity has been upgraded at warp speed and this has dramatically equalized geographic disadvantage the interior has faced for millennia. There are plenty of low-hanging fruit ripe for picking just one or two provinces away from the coast.<br>If I were an investor, the inland belt is where I will focus on in the coming two or three decades.<br>Crystal ball gazing Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong is hard. The easy answer is Shanghai, because Shanghai may well be the best known Chinese city after Hong Kong from a cultural and international standpoint. She has the benefit of clear political direction, excellent infrastructure and societal order. The Free Trade Zone has been continuously expanding since initialization in 2013. Much of China’s shipping will be funneled through Shanghai. She is already the world’s busiest port.<br>Shanghai is already China’s London or New York. It will overtake Hong Kong and Singapore as Asia’s primary financial center when the internationalization of the Yuan is complete. The world’s money will no longer flow through London and New York but also Shanghai, only it will be denominated in Yuan using alternatives to SWIFT, much like SEPA.<br>What counts against Shanghai is the argument it is already too big, and it grew too fast during the crazy 90s and 2000s. The excesses notwithstanding, changing needs made some investments look shortsighted, as relatively new infrastructure was repeatedly demolished to make way for even newer ones.<br>Shanghai’s growth is being curtailed today by sky-high real estate, and traffic congestion. Thoughtful solutions are needed to temper more moderate growth with quality of life.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb55f020e816e7f1423c2d605f700336"><br>Shenzhen is today’s China’s tech center. Not so much software and design like Silicon Valley, but more next-gen hardware like drones, mobility scooters, IP cameras and medical devices.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d244ba3d9b314bfb224187de28958df"><br>Huawei recently opened a gorgeous 3.5 sq. mile campus in neighboring Dongguan, cementing Shenzhen’s status as China’s tech hub in the coming decades. World class designs will come out of Shenzhen, as it becomes a magnet for top-tier talent. Huawei is already offering CNY2+ million packages to freshly minted but exceptional PhD graduates.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-64b76166349759d3e8e687de53ef4b4a"><br>The recently opened Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge will further improve Shenzhen’s connectivity, as travel times from Zhuhai to Shenzhen is cut by more than half. It will be interesting to follow the synergy that develop in the Pearl River Delta in the coming decades. Thankfully, pollution and congestion is less severe than Shanghai here.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a8bb1d5bbe8218d9f77530b9892edf6"><br>Finally, we come to the elephant in the room. Hong Kong deserves a section all on its own.<br>As a city that has been continuously developed for more than 150 years, Hong Kong has many more problems rooted in history. In recent decades, the poisoned chalice of democracy left by the British has crippled the city’s governance. Lack of political leadership has prevented Hong Kong from implementing solutions to long term problems such as housing, education, and economic diversification.<br>Put simply, Hong Kong has been operating like a boxer with one hand tied behind his back. But amazingly, Hong Kong has done remarkably well post-handover, despite moderate population growth of 14%.<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-589fc84435c6308e66826a5de240363b"><br>However, two decades after handover, we still see this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af0a78815c94af41edc0c962fab05709"><br>and this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22b990283783406ca57a648025758529"><br>and this:<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-43e742976f343735f69af3c3c95008cd"><br>In a city with nominal GDP per capita of US$48,000, one of the highest in Asia.<br>Prosperity mired in the incomprehensible.<br>The average Hong Kong youth, as the protests show, may be somewhat misguided. But make no mistake, Hong Kong’s uber competitiveness has produced generation after generation of outsize talent. Let me quote George Yeo:<br><blockquote><i>Apart from the high politics, at the atomic level, we have good people who are responsible who care for one another, I think </i><b><i>upon these bricks you can build the most wonderful structures</i></b><i>. But if the bricks are weak or crumble, then however you try, however brilliant the architect, nothing much is going to come out of it. So when I look at Hong Kong, I said yes there are problems, and the future is uncertain, and many things are not within their control, but they have good people, strong people, and they will survive.</i></blockquote><br>If a crippled Hong Kong with intractable problems today can consistently grow at 3, 4 percent, driven by talented people who have always found solutions to stay afloat, what do you think will happen when Hong Kong frees herself from the shackles she has put on and begin to seriously tackle her varied problems? Hong Kong is still very far away from being a futuristic 21st century city, despite her wealth and prosperity.<br>A crippled Hong Kong has pockets of impressive excellence, finding many urban solutions to the world’s densest population in many parts Kowloon and Hong Kong island.<br>What can an unencumbered people reimagine Hong Kong to be?<br>I may not live to see the day, but I hope Hong Kong grows up and claims her rightful spot as the jewel of the Pearl River Delta.<br>',
'<h2><span class="red">China and Iran flesh out strategic partnership</span></h2><br><img src="https://www.petroleum-economist.com/media/6837/tehran-mountains.jpg?mode=pad&width=1600&format=jpg&quality=90&slimmage=true&rnd=132119622720000000"><br><h3>Staggered 25-year deal could mark seismic shift in the global hydrocarbons sector</h3><br>Iran\'s foreign minister Mohammad Zarif paid a visit to his Chinese counterpart Wang Li at the end of August to present a road map for the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership, signed in 2016.<br>The updated agreement echoes many of the points contained in previous China-Iran accords, and already in the public domain. <br>However, many of the key specifics of this new understanding will not be released to the public, despite representing a potentially material shift to the global balance of the oil and gas sector, according to a senior source closely connected to Iran\'s petroleum ministry who spoke exclusively to <em>Petroleum Economist</em> in late August.<br>The central pillar of the new deal is that China will invest $280bn developing Iran\'s oil, gas and petrochemicals sectors. <br>This amount may be front-loaded into the first five-year period of the deal but the understanding is that further amounts will be available in every subsequent five-year period, subject to both parties\' agreement.<br>There will be another $120bn investment in upgrading Iran\'s transport and manufacturing infrastructure, which again can be front-loaded into the first five-year period and added to in each subsequent period should both parties agree.<br><h3>Chinese presence</h3><br>Among other benefits, Chinese companies will be given the first refusal to bid on any new, stalled or uncompleted oil and gasfield developments. <br>Chinese firms will also have first refusal on opportunities to become involved with any and all petchems projects in Iran, including the provision of technology, systems, process ingredients and personnel required to complete such projects.<br>"This will include up to 5,000 Chinese security personnel on the ground in Iran to protect Chinese projects, and there will be additional personnel and material available to protect the eventual transit of oil, gas and petchems supply from Iran to China, where necessary, including through the Persian Gulf," says the Iranian source.<br>"China will also be able to buy any and all oil, gas and petchems products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12pc to the six-month rolling mean price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6pc to 8pc of that metric for risk-adjusted compensation."<br>Under the terms of the new agreement, <em>Petroleum Economist</em> understands, China will be granted the right to delay payment for Iranian production up to two years. <br>China will also be able to pay in soft currencies that it has accrued from doing business in Africa and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) states, in addition to using renminbi should the need arise—meaning that no US dollars will be involved in these commodity transaction payments from China to Iran.<br>"Given the exchange rates involved in converting these soft currencies into hard currencies that Iran can obtain from its friendly Western banks—including Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank [in Germany], Oberbank [in Austria] and Halkbank [in Turkey]—China is looking at another 8-12pc discount [relative to the dollar price of the average benchmarks], which means a total discount of up to 32pc for China on all oil, gas and petchems purchases," the source says.<br>Another positive factor for China is that its close involvement in the build-out of Iran\'s manufacturing infrastructure will be entirely in line with its One Belt, One Road initiative. <br>China intends to utilise the low cost labour available in Iran to build factories, designed and overseen by large Chinese manufacturing companies, with identical specifications and operations to those in China, according to the Iranian source.<br><h3>Transport infrastructure</h3><br>The resulting products will be able to enter Western markets via routes built or enhanced by China\'s increasing involvement in Iran\'s transport infrastructure. <br>When the draft deal was presented in late August to Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei by Iran\'s vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri—and senior figures from the Economic and Finance Ministry, the Petroleum Ministry and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—he announced that Iran had signed a contract with China to implement a project to electrify the main 900km railway connecting Tehran to the north-eastern city of Mashhad. <br>Jahangiri added that there are also plans to establish a Tehran-Qom-Isfahan high-speed train line and to extend this upgraded network up to the north-west through Tabriz.<br>Tabriz, home to a number of key oil, gas and petchems sites, and the starting point for the Tabriz-Ankara gas pipeline, will be a pivot point of the 2,300km New Silk Road that links Urumqi (the capital of China\'s western Xinjiang Province) to Tehran, connecting Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan along the way, and then via Turkey into Europe, says the Iranian source.<br>The pipeline plan will require the co-operation of Russia, as it regards the FSU states as its backyard. <br>And, because, until recently, Russia was weighing a similarly all-encompassing standalone deal with Iran. <br>So, according to the source, the agreement includes a clause allowing at least one Russian company to have the option of being involved, also on discounted terms, alongside a Chinese operator.<br><h3>Benefits for Iran</h3><br>The Iranians expect three key positives from the 25-year deal, according to the source. <br>The first flows from China being one of just five countries to hold permanent member status on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). <br>Russia, tangentially included in the new deal, also holds a seat, alongside the US, the UK and France.<br>"In order to circumvent any further ramping up of sanctions—and over time encourage the US to come back to the negotiating table—Iran now has two out of five UNSC votes on its side. <br>The fact that [Iran foreign minister Mohammad] Zarif showed up unexpectedly at the G7 summit in August at the invitation of France may imply it has another permanent member on side," he adds.<br>A second Iranian positive is that the deal will allow it to finally expedite increases in oil and gas production from three of its key fields. <br>China has agreed to up the pace on its development of one of Iran\'s flagship gas field project, Phase 11 of the giant South Pars gas field (SP11). <br>China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of China\'s \'big three\' producers, added to its 30pc holding in the field when it took over Total\'s 50.1pc stake, following the French major\'s withdrawal in response to US sanctions. <br>CNPC had since made little progress developing SP11—a 30pc+ discount to the global market price on potential condensate and LNG exports could change that.<br>China has also agreed to increase production from Iran\'s West Karoun oil fields—including North Azadegan, operated by CNPC, and Yadavaran, operated by fellow \'big three\' firm Sinopec—by an additional 500,000bl/d by the end of 2020. <br>Iran hopes to increase projected recovery rates from these West Karoun fields, which it shares with neighbour Iraq, from a current 5pc of reserves in place to at least 25pc by the end of 2021 at the very latest. <br>"For every percentage point increase, the recoverable reserves figure would increase by 670mn bl, or around $34bn in revenues even with oil at $50/bl," the Iranian source says.<br>A final Iranian benefit is that China has agreed to increase imports of Iranian oil, in defiance of a US decision not to extend China\'s waiver on imports from Iran in May. <br>China\'s General Administration of Customs (GAC) figures released in late August show that, far from reducing its Iranian imports, China imported over 925,000bl/d from the country in July, up by 4.7pc month-on-month, from an already high base.<br>The actual figure is still higher, according to the Iranian source, with excess barrels being kept in floating storage in and around China; without having gone through customs they do not show up on customs data, but are effectively part of China\'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.<br>',

More than half of these firms are in manufacturing and services, contributing twelve percent of Africa’s $500 billion annual manufacturing output–more than China contributes to America’s economy.</li><br><li>The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), in which Gwadar is a vital terminal, has brought so many benefits to Pakistan’s previously underdeveloped region of Balochistan that the founder of the “Baloch Liberation Front” Dr. Jumma Khan Marri disowned the separatist cause that he previously fought for and launched the Pakistani Baloch Unity organization for peacefully reintegrating his wayward compatriots back into the national fold and credited the CPEC for inspiring him to lay down arms because he said, “It has given the Baloch hope for our future.” In other words, China is solving Pakistan’s terrorist problem by helping it develop.</li><br><li>At the University of Ruhuna in Matara, on the Indian Ocean, oceanographer Tilak Priyadarshana heads a newly built ocean and climate research facility with Wang Dongxiao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) South China Sea Institute of Oceanology in Guangzhou, sends joint teams sail on a Chinese research ship, investigating the meteorology of the Indian Ocean and the geology of its sea bed – neither of which Sri Lanka could afford to do before now. Forty students from Ruhuna have gone to China to study for master’s degrees, “Our biggest problem is human resources,” Priyadarshana says, “I couldn’t just put up a building, as we are a poor nation and lack a scientific culture. That is what we are getting from China.” It’s all about helping others.</li><br><li>To knit these alliances together, Beijing launched the Global Electric Interconnect, GEIDCO in 2016, a grid of ultra-high voltages lines continually transmitting clean energy across Eurasia with the sun. Today, GEIDCO has seven regional offices, forty global offices, six-hundred regional and national members, and has invested $1.6 trillion in eighty generation and transmission projects across Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America.

'<h2>Can America learn from China’s amazing high-speed rail network?</h2><br>No, high speed rail will not happen in America at least not in 100 years. <br>Their system is the reason . <br>It’s a lie to say that Americans don’t need HSR. <br>If there was one from LA to SF and we would use same HST from Beijing to Shanghai, it would take only 1 hour and 40 minutes .Who will drive for 6–7 hours or take a flight ?<br>China used the power of the country to do whatever they think it’s right to do and do it with high efficiency . <br>America is a “ free” country, everybody is free to disagree/oppose with any plan including very good plan for America. <br>Americans would spend 30 years to debate if a freeway should be extended and end of day they killed the plan, or they have debated how to handle homeless people living on the streets for the last 20 years and still got no solution and we are getting more and more homeless on the streets.<br>So, if you want to see or enjoy great and most advanced infrastructures, you can’t do that here in America, you need go to China. <br>Sorry .<br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1c5222f883cb2dc541a06a5b96e8f412"><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d80d9aef824c8b50b3fc3abe1dbbccea"><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c0c244d7e596998008f016ebbd59eb01"><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22a359f066f5aa3ad8e1080c809763e0"><br>',
'<h2>美国是最大的“庞氏骗局”</h2><br>其实我早就不耐烦讲这个话题了，可是总有人听不懂，谈到国际关系的时候，还是满嘴的道义、人权、意识形态。<br><br>说来说去，还是那套二十年前的废话，如果“意识形态”真的很重要的话？为什么美国要打“贸易战”？为什么要逼日韩德国交钱？为什么要违背自由贸易原则？为什么要赶走移民？为什么要在边界建墙？<br>嘴上喊着“民主自由”，私下里干的都是“杀猪吃肉”的活儿；换一种说法——达则自由开放，穷则杀猪吃肉。<br>赌场上，庄家是怎么吃散户的，美国就是怎么“吃”世界各国的。<br><br>什么鬼的意识形态，他们真在乎意识形态的话，就不会和封建独裁国家沙特哥俩好了，却把民选总统的埃及、叙利亚、乌克兰搞成乌烟瘴气了。<br><br>如果你中学政治、历史课上没有睡觉，就会记得一件事，一件经常发生的事情——“资本主义转嫁经济危机”。<br><br>资本主义有个痼疾，就是每隔一段时间，都会生产力过剩，而消费不足，贫富差距极度拉大，这时候就会产生“债务经济”，通过负债来拉动经济增长，这是一招饮鸩止渴的妙计，债务积累到一定规模，那是要暴雷的。<br>但资本主义国家有着压倒性的科技、军事优势，他们可以“转嫁金融危机”，放在更早的时候，他们简单粗暴，选择发动“世界大战”，直接消灭生产力、人口和债务，把系统归零，然后重新开始。<br><br><img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/1hbMm9fxQOI6CDun82DBYIr4YjogjiacSaowWL7HC4Qm1ua9SgmnXQqhgCs0VbZA30ZPcNDm1A7oVSWZPHjjHkw/640"><br>世界大战的赢家，可以直接站在输家的尸体上吃肉喝血，几乎零成本卷走战败国的财富、资源、精英人才，最大的赢家，甚至还可以建立此后的世界政治经济格局，制定游戏规则。<br><br>比如说，弄一个“布雷顿森林体系”，把本国的货币和黄金捆绑（后来和石油捆绑），变成世界货币，从此就可以开动印钞机，用白纸换来全世界的优质资源，这就叫征收“铸币税”，这就叫“赢家通吃”。<br><br>现在是文明时代，发动世界大战吃相太难看，但他们还是有办法，他们选择“祸水东引”，把金融危机放到别的国家去引爆。<br><br>自二战以来，一共出现了四次金融危机：<br>1975年，世界第一次石油危机爆发，使得发达国家产生额严重的滞涨现象，即经济停滞，通货膨胀，持续了10年之久。<br><br>这一次经济危机之后美国中下层的储蓄被全部吸走。<br><br>1987年，华尔街黑色星期一，导致全球股市暴跌。<br><br>美国为了转嫁危机，对日本发起贸易战。<br><br>1989年日本被迫签订《广场协议》，从此之后失去了30年到今天。<br><br>1997年“亚洲金融风暴”，1997-1998年 两年，波及范围扩展到整个亚洲，严重伤害了日本、东南亚和香港的经济！<br>2008年，美国次贷危机爆发，席卷美国、欧盟和日本等世界主要金融市场，他们却把债务打包成理财产品放到香港销售，再次伤害了香港人民，最后，次贷危机转移到了欧洲，形成了欧洲债务危机。<br><br>你把冷战后一系列的世界变局串起来看，就会明白了，从伊拉克战争、到东南亚金融风暴、再到颜色革命、再到贸易战，都是美国“杀猪吃肉”的行为。<br><br>美国本身，其实是一个历史上最大的“庞氏骗局”，因为它是世界第一强国，所以美元是世界货币，所有任何一个国家都会持有美元、美债，所以，美国的财富，其实就是世界人民的财富，但如果美国经济本身已经泡沫化了，你想想，这个世界该多危险？<br>投资理财的朋友都明白，投资的核心在于“信心”，所有金融把戏，说到底都是“心理学游戏”，考验的是大家“信不信”，你如果相信美国依旧是世界老大，依旧会统治一切，那么它自然还能吸纳全世界的财富，苟延残喘。<br>但你要知道，全世界的存量也是有限的，庞氏骗局拆东墙补西墙，肥的只是华尔街一小撮人，终有一天，这个游戏是玩不下去的。<br><br>过去10年中，美国似乎完全没有任何经济问题，美联储多年来一直支持泡沫，美、欧、日的大量货币量化宽松政策创造了高估的股票和垃圾债券泡沫。<br>数据显示，目前，发达国家的股票、债券和楼市的价格接近甚至超越了次贷危机前的水平了。<br><br>一直以来，大家都知道美国股市存在泡沫，美股依旧躺在半空中，但是在2019年8月15日晚间，美股开盘后，通用电气就闪崩暴跌，盘中跌幅一度高达15%，截至收盘，通用电气股价下跌11.3%，创11年单日最大跌幅。<br>市值蒸发626亿。<br>因为美国会计界大神Harry Markopolos发布了一份175页的报告，称通用电气涉嫌在虚假财务报表中隐瞒财务问题的严重程度，并将其称为“比安然公司更大的欺诈行为”！“<br>我的团队过去7个月一直在分析通用电气的会计账目，我们认为我们所遇到的380亿美元欺诈案只是冰山一角。”<br>通用电气，曾经是世界上最伟大的公司之一，结果存在几百亿美金的欺诈行为，380亿美元，是通用的冰山一角，那么通用，是不是整个美股市场的冰山一角呢？是不是细思极恐？现在，美债收益率倒挂，美联储在低位进行降息，你想想，问题严重到了什么程度？<br>如果这一次，像2008年那样的暴雷，美联储还能不能撑得住？<br>过往一切，都是序章！<br>经济危机，是需要“祸水东引”，转嫁灾难的，当年他们可以宰割欧洲、东南亚，后来他们可以搞死土耳其、阿根廷。<br>现在，旧的韭菜已经所剩无几，新的韭菜还没有长起来，那么屠刀将要挥向谁？<br>有人说——中国？拜托，中国不是猪，也不是韭菜，而是一头长大了、露出了爪牙的狮子，体量之大，力道之雄，史上罕有。<br>中国不是苏联，不是德国，也不是日本，想从中国这边割肉，小打小闹的贸易战是不管用的，“新冷战”也是不管用的。<br><br>除非，你想撕破脸皮“热战”，我想，当今世界，没有谁敢和工业总产值是美国+日本+德国之和的“世界工厂”开战。<br><br>所有，我希望大家都昂起头好好过自家的日子，不要怂。<br>',
'<h2><span class="red">鹅城最大的问题，在于有个黄四郎</span></h2><br>原创： 申鹏 平原公子 今天<br>汤师爷高，马县长硬，黄四郎是又高又硬。<br>黄四郎放在历史上，也是有功绩的，有贡献的，人家也是鹅城元勋，背景深厚，放在中外各国，口碑都不差。<br>这人说话又好听，八面玲珑，长袖善舞。<br>他自己摘光了鹅城的瓜，又说什么“黄台之瓜，何堪再摘？”<br>既喊着“反暴力”，又要衙门“网开一面”。<br>他号称白手起家，靠着老婆和投机，做到了富可敌国，鹅城百姓本就爱富人，把富人当偶像，大家拥戴也是正常。<br>哪怕他现在坐拥半座鹅城，住在价值七亿的豪华碉楼里，风吹不着雨打不着，吃着火锅唱着歌，把税收到2050年去了，你也没有办法。<br>黄四郎先生是个体面人，他不关心鹅城是谁的，也不关心鹅城是什么制度，更不关心鹅城人民的死活。<br>他只希望自己能够不断赚钱，不断摘瓜，自己还要能够站在干岸上，干干净净，说着漂亮话，放着悠闲屁。<br>人们不会骂黄四郎，人们只会骂县长，说县长都是恶棍、流氓、贪官、无能、寄生虫。<br>却不想想，这鹅城从来不是县长说了算的地方，县长的什么政策，没有黄老爷点头，是推行不下去的。<br>鹅城的土地、房产、商业、能源、通讯、传媒、港口，都在以黄四郎为首十大乡绅手上，普通人衣食住行吃喝拉撒，用的都是黄老爷家的，黄老爷想涨价就涨价，想故意囤积就囤积，想套现离场就套现离场。<br>外面的土匪假张麻子都说了：<br>“大家都是抢，没啥区别，只不过我是明抢，黄老爷是风度翩翩地抢罢了。”<br>鹅城大部分人是没有正经房子住的，只能住鹅棚。<br>难道鹅城没有土地吗？<br>不是，鹅城的土地都做了度假森林、别墅花园、以及黄四郎打球的高尔夫球场。<br>第一任县长要给大家造房子，造好多好多的房子，但房子多了，房价自然就要下跌，黄四郎和乡绅们不愿意房价下跌，就鼓动有房子没房子的鹅城人都上街，让县长造不成房子。<br>后来有一任县长要填海造陆，多搞点土地出来，结果一群人有说这破坏生态环境。<br>所以大家宁可住鹅棚，一家人挤20个平方的鹅棚，失去了工作能力的老人，只能住铁丝网做的鹅笼，还得强作笑颜说：<br>“一家人最重要是整整齐齐，做人最重要的是开心。”<br>其实大家都是人，又不是鹅，住在鹅棚鹅笼里，怎么可能开心呢？<br>不开心总得找个发泄口吧？<br>他们可不敢冲黄老爷的碉楼，因为碉楼的保安是真敢打人的，他们只敢冲县长张麻子的县衙，因为县衙的警察们是不会还手的。<br>黄四郎的走狗记者媒体们，颠倒是非操纵舆论乃是一绝，他们可以煽动民众情绪，颠倒黑白，把普通人的痛苦，都归结到县长和普通公务员身上去，甚至要逼得你剖腹自证清白。<br>讲实话，张麻子抢了鹅城老百姓吗？<br>张麻子欺负了鹅城老百姓吗？<br>没有啊！<br>抢他们的，欺负他们的，是黄四郎啊，可是不成啊，鹅城百姓个个如花姐，不拿抢指着黄四郎，倒拿枪指着张麻子，理由是———谁让你是个好人呢？<br>这个时候，黄四郎还要站出来说：<br>“请县长大人对鹅城百姓网开一面，黄台之瓜，何堪再摘？”<br>',
'<h2><span class="red">商人有祖国，买办没有</span></h2><br>我最讨厌某些人推卸责任的时候，云淡风轻来一句：“我只是一个商人。”<br><br>商人也是人，一个社会意义上的人是有祖国的。<br>你的财富、名声、权势，都来自于你的国家，你的人民，来自这一片土地，你不能在富有之后，就卷走财富，并且声称自己超然物外，没有国籍，没有故乡，装逼说自己属于世界，属于地球。<br>作为商人，一定要明白，自己吃谁的饭，是谁养活了自己，在关键的时刻，应该站在哪一边？<br>受过九年义务教育的同学，大概都知道“弦高退秦师”的故事，弦高是郑国商人，在国外经商的时候听说秦军要入侵自己的祖国，此时他一边向郑国报告敌情，一边伪装成郑国使者，犒劳秦军；<br>秦军以为郑国已有防备，只好班师。<br>郑国君主要赏赐弦高，他却拒绝道：<br>“作为商人,忠于国家是理所当然的,如果受奖,岂不是把我当作外人了吗?”<br>春秋时候大名鼎鼎的管仲也是商人出身，做到了齐国相国，一生最拿手的本事，就是搞“贸易战”，他辅佐齐桓公成为春秋五霸之首，人家没有祖国吗？<br>近代的张謇、卢作孚、荣氏兄弟、侯德榜，都是“商人”，可他们没有祖国吗？<br>有一句屁话叫做“资本没有国界”。<br>这句话来自于国际金融资本家们，以犹太资本为首的国际金融资本确实是是没有国界的，资本主义制度实际上就是他们发明的用金钱控制资本主义国家的政治和经济，他们作为幕后黑手操控资本主义国家来对全球实行金融殖民的制度，所谓的把权力关进笼子，就是被大金融资本控制了政治经济，把政府和政客变成了他们的提线木偶。<br>但从来没人敢说：<br>“资本家没有祖国”！<br>我不讲中国，我讲美国，美国的资本家，比我们的某些“商人”更有立场，更讲政治，也更爱国！<br>特朗普是什么人？<br>商人，一口一个“让美国重新伟大”，一口一个“一定要遏制中国”。<br>索罗斯说什么？<br>他说：“我对击败中国更感兴趣！”。<br>巴菲特一个炒股的资本家，满口都是“最好的投资就是爱国”！<br>去年甲骨文公司的CEO，在接受媒体采访时，直接讲出了“中国威胁论”，西方世界的一部分资本家，早已把他们的个人命运和国家绑在一起。<br>我说个最坦白的道理——美利坚兴，他们继续躺着数钱；<br>美利坚亡，他们就是无根的浮萍，待宰的肥羊。<br>而很多发展中国家的商人和资本家，却恰恰相反，一屁股坐在发达国家那边，那国内的利益，去输送给自己的“洋大人”，一旦“洋大人”和祖国之间有了分歧和冲突，他们更是坚定地站在洋大人一边，指责自己的祖国做的不好，做出的让步不够多，居然不肯向洋大人妥协......<br>这种人，自清末以来，数不胜数，其实，他们不配叫做商人，更不配称什么“资本家”，他们只是“买办”而已，什么叫做买办？<br>就是吃着我家的饭，拿着我家的工资，还要把我家的财物偷出去，贱价卖给外人，从中获得一点蝇头小利。<br>买办不希望国家发达起来，不希望国家拥有真正的工业和科技，他希望国家永远落后，永远低人一头，永远需要去高价买洋大人的东西，他们才可以从中赚钱。<br>他们对损公肥私、掏空国家、剥削人民得心应手，你让他对国家的经济、工业、农业做点贡献，他是死活都不肯的，那比要他的命还难。<br>在他眼里，什么道德，什么法律，什么政治，都无关紧要，他和他的钱最重要。<br>最近某位老先生，就给我们上了一堂课，你和他讲道德，他和你谈法律，你和他谈法律，他跟你谈自由，你让他翻译翻译什么是自由，他说自由就是不要追究，要“网开一面”。<br>《我只是一个商人》是老家伙2016年转移香港和内地资产、投资英国之后写的文章，当时大家也没怎么批评他，有人不过写了篇《斯人已去，不必挽留》，他就就跳脚跳上天，说“我只是一个商人，不要拿道德来要求我！”<br>可见他心胸气度很差，难怪给亡妻修了那么一个破楼。<br>我在想，难怪很多顶级富豪都信神信鬼信宗教，原来他们眼里早已没有道德，没有法律了，因为他们太有钱，权力太大，以至于人间的道德和法律在他们面前失效了，所以他们不关心人类，只关心自己，所以他们就只好“不问苍生问鬼神”了。<br>他曾经花15亿，在新界大埔区，建了全球第二高的观音像，他一生假惺惺做慈善、买口碑，却没有真的关心过，那几百万每天给他交钱，却没有正经地方住的人民。<br>你这“慈悲”，给谁看呢？<br>这种人，既虚伪，又矫情，脾气还大，不允许批评。<br>这半年来的行为，也证明了这点，说不得骂不得，老虎的屁股摸不得，自己大放厥词说什么“黄台之瓜，何堪再摘”，扯什么“最好的因，最坏的果”，被人批评后，迫不及待跳出来对线，消停了没几天，又扯什么“对未来的主人翁网开一面”，被怼了之后 又跳出来扯“我不是这个意思”。<br>总之不管他什么意思，老先生是不能批评的，无论这里变成什么样，这位老先生也是没有责任的，“我就是个商人而已！”<br>同样都是商人，人和人怎么就那么大的区别呢？<br>前几天，任正非接受《经济学人》采访的时候说：<br>“某地的情况恰恰是极端资本主义造成的，大资本家们挣了非常多的钱，连小报亭、地下停车场、咖啡厅很多都是他们掌控的，拿走了太多的利益，普通老百姓没有多少钱，很多人生活水平很低。”<br>讲道理，任正非也是商人，也是赚钱牟利的，人家怎么就能坦坦荡荡把资本主义的本质赤裸裸剖开展示在大家面前呢？<br>人家怎么就能说人话，做人事呢？<br>刚刚说到的那位老先生不是商人，商人也是有祖国的，他也不是什么民族企业家，民族企业家也是有产品的，他的产品是什么？<br>他一切的财富，都来自于这块土地，和这块土地的人民，他的崛起和暴富，也赖于这块土地给他的政策和便利，现在，他是个加拿大人，大量资产在英国。<br>商人有祖国，买办没有。<br>',
