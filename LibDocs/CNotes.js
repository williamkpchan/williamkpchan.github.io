'<h2><span class="orange">Features of C language</span></h2>\nThe C programming language is a <b>feature-rich</b> programming language. \nIt has all the required features that a developer (beginner or expert) would want a programming language to have.\nHere is a simple chart to list the <b>main features of the C language</b>.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1631529119-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nLet\'s talk about all these features one by one.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Simple and Efficient</h2>\nThe C Language is a simple language that is easy to learn even for a beginner and is super efficient to use both in terms of the time of development and time of execution.\nYes, if you want to create software using C language you can do so in quite less time depending upon the size of the software that you want to code.\nThe learning curve for C language is less.\nThe scope of C language is also less so you won\'t get confused like in Python which has many popular libraries (you keep thinking about which one to learn).\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Portability</h2>\nC Language program runs the same way everywhere. \nIt means if you have written a simple <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/programs/" target="_blank">C program</a> like a <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/programs/numbers/sum-of-n-numbers" target="_blank">program to find sum of N numbers in C</a>, on your Windows operating system and then compiled it and run it, you can then take the compiled code and run it on any other operating system or machine, like, Linux or macOS, etc., your C program will always return the same result.\nIf you have a software written in the C language for Unix OS, and you now want to run it on Windows OS, you can <b>easily adapt the software</b> (with <em>some modifications or no modifications at all</em>) for Windows OS, and that is the power of the C language.\nHence, we can say that the C language is portable.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Structured Programming language</h2>\nC language is a structured programming language because we can <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/user-defined-functions-in-c.php" target="_blank">create functions in the C language</a>.\nUsing functions we can separate a particular operation from the main program and then use it again and again.\nA structured language is not just about having the ability to create functions, but it supports <b>loops</b>, <b>conditional statements</b>, etc.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Powerful</h2>\nIt has a broad range of features like support for many <b>data types, operators, keywords, etc.</b>, that allows the structuring of code using <b>functions</b>, <b>loops</b>, <b>decision-making statements</b>, etc.\nThen there are complex data structures like <b>structures</b>, <b>arrays</b>, etc., and <b>pointers</b>, which makes C quite resourceful.\nUsing the C language you can <b>easily read, write and create files</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Rich Standard Library</h2>\nC supports various inbuilt functions and libraries that create development fast.\nThe <b>standard library support</b> for the C language is superb and you will see that a lot of keywords or ready-made operations that you will use while writing code in C language are already pre-defined.\nYou just have to use them, without worrying about how they work.\nThese libraries are called <b>Header files</b> in C language.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Multithreaded</h2>\nC language supports multi-threading, which means multiple code processes can run in parallel.\nThis feature was introduced in <b>C11</b>.\nA new header file <b>threads.h</b> was added for multithreading support.\nAnother header file <b>subatomic.h</b> for supporting atomic operations.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Libraries Support</h2>\nThere is not just the standard library for C language but also a <b>large ecosystem of 3rd party libraries</b>, which are created by developers/coders around the world, and anyone can use them.\nEven you can write your own C language library and distribute it online through your GitHub profile. \nYou never know, people around the world might need your solution.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Separate Compilation</h2>\nC language code is compiled and then it is run. \nYou will learn <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/compile-and-run-c-program.php" target="_blank">how the C language code is compiled</a> in another tutorial.\nFor now, just assume that the code is compiled. \nObviously, the compilation of code will take some time.\nA small piece of code will compile faster while a large code will take time to get compiled.\nIn C language you can <b>break your code and put it in multiple source code files</b>. \nC language will compile the files separately and then link them together for execution. \nThis makes <b>compilation fast</b>.\nAnother plus point of this is, <b>multiple programmers/developers</b> can work on different code files while working on a single project.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Middle-Level Language</h2>\nThe C programming language brings together the best of both worlds.\nA low-level language is generally fast, and powerful but hard to understand and write code in.\nWhereas a <b>High-level Language</b> is easy for us to understand and write code in, it is also highly portable, but it is generally slow and is unable to directly talk to the system hardware.\nThe C programming language is said to be a <b>Middle-level</b> programming language, as it allows manipulation of bits, bytes, and addresses, hence providing low-level access to the computer systems, while being easy to use, portable, and supporting all other features of a High-level language, etc.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;10. \nSynt&emsp;ax-based Language</h2>\nThere are <b>proper rules for writing the code</b>, and the C language strictly follows them.\nIf you write anything that is not allowed, you will get a compile-time error, which happens when the compiler is unable to compile your code because of some incorrect code syntax.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;11. \nForm&emsp;at Free Language</h2>\nThe C language is a format-free language.\nThere are no line numbers needed in the C language code, or we can say that the line number holds no significance.\nThere is no need to place statements on a specified location on a line.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;12. \nComp&emsp;iled Language</h2>\nThe C language uses a Compiler to compile the code into <b>object code</b>, which is nothing but <b>machine code</b> that the computer understands. \nHence to run a C language program we have to install a C language compiler first.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;13. \nCase&emsp;-sensitive Language</h2>\nIn C, the uppercase and lowercase characters are different. \nThat means <k>if</k> is not the same as <k>IF</k> in C language.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions, that beginners have when they learn about features of the C language.\n<h4>What are the main features of the C language?</h4>\nThe main features of the C language are, it is <b>simple(easy to learn) yet powerful</b>, <b>Portable</b>, <b>Mid-level language</b>, which is <b>structured</b> and needs a <b>Compiler</b> for execution. \nThe C language also has a <b>rich standard library</b> with the support of <b>extensive 3rd party libraries</b>.\n<h4>What is the main reason behind the popularity of the C language?</h4>\nThe main reason behind the popularity of the C language is that it has a rich feature set, making it a suitable language for a wide range of use cases. \nYou can create an operating system using C language or any other simple software. \nThe C language is a general-purpose programming language.\n<h4>Why is C considered a Powerful Programming Language?</h4>\nIt is considered a powerful language because it provides a broad range of features like support for many <b>data types, operators, keywords, etc.</b>, allows structuring of code using <b>functions</b>, <b>loops</b>, <b>decision-making statements</b>, then there are complex data-structures like <b>structures</b>, <b>arrays</b>, etc., and <b>pointers</b>, which makes C quite resourceful and powerful, etc.\n<h4>Is C language Portable?</h4>\nYes, the C language code is <b>portable</b>. \nIf you have software written in the C language for Unix OS, and you now want to run it on Windows OS, you can easily adapt the software for Windows OS, and that is the power of the C language.\n<h4>What are the advantages of C Language?</h4>\nGiven below are some of the advantages of the C language:\na) C is a Portable language.\nb) It provides rich support of built-in functions.\nc) It is a powerful and efficient language.\nd) C language is a structured language, with features of both High-level language and Low-level language.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Introduction - C Programming Language</span></h2>\nC programming language was developed by <b>Dennis Ritchie at AT & T\'s Bell Laboratories</b> in 1972.\nIn 1989, the C language was standardized, where C language features were defined, as the <b>1989 ANSI standard</b> for C, hence it is also called <b>C89</b>, because of the 1989 ANSI standard.\nThe <em>current latest version</em> of the C language is <b>C17</b>, which was released in June 2018. \nNo new features were added to this version only a few basic corrections were made and some bugs in the C11 version were fixed.\nA new standard revision of C programming language is expected in 2023 which will be called <b>C23</b> or <b>C2x</b>. \n\nThere are two types of programming languages:\n<b>High-level</b> language which is problem oriented\n<b>Low-level</b> language which is machine oriented\nC Language is a <b>middle-level</b> programming language that has features of both low-level programming language and high-level programming languages.\nC language <b>compiler</b> converts the readable C language code into machine instructions.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Versions of C Language</h2>\nFollowing are the different versions of the C programming language released till now:\n<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="1" style="width:100%;"><tbody>\n<tr><td><b>C language Version</b></td><td><b>Year</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>C89</td><td>1989</td></tr>\n<tr><td>C99</td><td>1999</td></tr>\n<tr><td>C11 or C1x</td><td>2011</td></tr>\n<tr><td>C17</td><td>2018</td></tr>\n<tr><td>C23 or C2x</td><td>2023</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/curious/uploads/pictures/1685527251-.png">\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Latest Version of C</h2>\nThe current version of the C language is <b>C17</b>, which was <b>introduced in 2018</b>. \nIt is supported by all the standard C language compilers, but many compilers still do not support this.\nFeaturewise C17 is the same as the previous C version <b>C11</b>.\nThe <b>most widely used version</b> of the C language is still <b>C89</b>, <b>C99</b>, and <b>C11</b>.\nThe <b>C23</b> version is expected to launch in <b>2023</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Why is C Language so popular?</h2>\nC language is a good language to introduce yourself to the programming world, because it is simple, easy to learn, and covers all the basic concepts of programming.\nThe scope of C language is limited, so it is good for beginners to start programming.\nInitially, C language can be used for writing <b>system-level programs</b>, like designing Operating Systems, OS kernels, etc.\nC language can be used to develop simple software, like <b>Text Editors, Compilers, Network Drivers</b>, and many traditional PoS(Point of Sale) software like <b>Restaurant Billing systems</b>, etc.\nSome popular applications build using C language are <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>, <b>MySQL Database</b>, <b>Chromium browser</b>, etc.\nIf you are in college, you can clear college placement interviews by learning C language, and get a job in good service-based companies like TCS, Infosys, IBM, Accenture, etc.\n\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Features of C Language</h2>\nThe following are the features of the C programming language:\nIt has an easy-to-learn and <b>simple</b> syntax.\nIt is highly <b>portable</b>. \nYou can write your code on your machine, compile it and run it anywhere.\nC is a structured programming language. \nYou can write code in C language using functions, to give your program proper structure.\nThere are many libraries and header files available in C language and the community for C language is very large.\nIt is a compiled language.\nIt is case-sensitive.\n\nHere are all the <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/features-of-c.php" target="_blank">features of C language</a> listed in detail.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Hello World Program in C</h2>\nHere is a simple Hello World program in C programming:\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\nprintf("Hello, World!");\nreturn 0;\n}</k>\n\nHello, World!\nThe basic program structure for C programs is:\n<k>preprocessor directives\nmacros\nglobal declarations\nint main() {\n program logic\n}</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Write Code in C and execute it</h2>\nYou can write C code in any editor, or you can use <b>Turbo C/C++</b> which is an IDE for C language.\nThe programs are stored in files with <b>.c</b> extension.\nC compiler is used to compile the C code and generate the <b>object code</b> which is stored in <b>.o</b> extension file.\nThe object code is then run to get the output.\nC language is <b>case-sensitive</b>, so you have to be careful while writing code.\nEvery line of code in a C program must end with a semicolon (<k>;</k>). \nIf you miss the semicolon, then the compiler will give an error.\nIf you write anything incorrect while writing a C program, the C compiler will give an error and stop the program execution.\n\nTo understand how C programs are compiled, read this - <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/c-compilation-process.php" target="_blank">C program compilation</a></b>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Keywords in C</h2>\nKeywords are words that have special meanings, stored in the standard installation of C programming language and the C compiler knows what is the meaning of all these keywords.\nC programming has <b>32 keywords</b>.\n<k>auto  double   int   struct \nbreak    else  long  switch \ncase  enum  register typedef \nchar  extern   return   union \nconst    float    short    unsigned \ncontinue for   signed   void \ndefault  goto  sizeof   volatile \ndo    if    static   while</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Datatypes and Variables</h2>\nC language has 5 default datatypes. \nThey are,\n<k>int</k>\n<k>char</k>\n<k>long</k>\n<k>float</k>\n<k>double</k>\nA datatype defines the type of data, values allowed, and what operations can be performed on that data.\nA variable is used to store data in it. \nYou can create a variable of any datatype in C language. \nOnce defined the variable can only store the value of that datatype.\n\nHere is a simple C program where we have created a variable and assigned it a value,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\n // variable of integer datatype\nint x;\n x = 77;\nreturn 0;\n}</k>\nLearn more about data types and variables - <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php">Datatypes in C</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php">Variables in C</a></b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Print anything on the console</h2>\nTo print anything on the console or to give output from a C program you can use the <k>printf()</k> function.\nThe <k>printf</k> function is defined in the <b>stdio.h</b> header file.\nSo to use the <k>printf</k> function, you have to include the <b>stdio.h</b> header file in your C program.\nYou can provide any text message to the <k>printf</k> function to print it on the console.\n\nHere is a simple code example,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\nprintf("Welcome to Studytonight");\nreturn 0;\n}</k>\nTo learn more about <k>printf</k> function, check this out: <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/c-input-output-function.php">C Input & Output</a></b>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Take user input from keyboard</h2>\nTo take user input in the C program you can use the <k>scanf()</k> function. \nThe <k>scanf</k> function is also defined in the <b>stdio.h</b> header file.\nYou can use <k>scanf</k> function to take input of a specific type of value.\nFor example, if you have to take an integer value input, then:\nYou need a variable of type integer to store the input value in.\nYou will have to specify a placeholder to inform the <k>scanf</k> function which type of value it should expect.\nIf you provide a value of some other type, the C compiler will give an error.\n\n<b>Placeholders</b> are special characters for different datatype values to inform the C compiler, which type of value to expect.\n<k>%d</k> for <em>integer</em> type\n<k>%c</k> for <em>character</em> type\n<k>%d</k> for <em>double</em>, etc.\nHere is a code example,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\n int x;\nscanf("%d", &amp;x);\nreturn 0;\n}</k>\nThe <k>&amp;</k> operator is used to get the memory address of the variable to store the input value in it.\nTo learn more about <k>scanf</k> function, check this out: <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/c-input-output-function.php">C Input & Output</a></b>\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions, that beginners have when they start learning the C language.\n<h4>What is the C language?</h4>\nIt is a computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories.\nIt is a programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX, but later it was used for developing software and programs for daily usage. \nIt is still being used to develop operating systems and for creating system-level programs, by big tech companies (FAANG companies).\n<h4>What are the features of the C language?</h4>\nC is one of the most popular programming languages. \nIt has many features:\n<b>Modularity:</b> It allows the reusability of modules. \nIt has header files with readymade functions that you can use.\n<b>Middle-Level language:</b> It combines both the advantages of low-level and high-level languages. \n(<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/arrays-in-c.php">C arrays</a>, <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/pointers-in-c.php">C Pointers</a>, etc.)\n<b>General-purpose programming language:</b> It can be used to implement any kind of application, just like Python. \n(<b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/python/" target="_blank">Learn Python</a></b>)\n<b>Portability: </b> C program can be compiled or executed in any operating system (Unix, DOS, Windows). \nYou can compile the program in Windows and then run it on a Unix machine, it will run without any issue.\n<b>Powerful programming language:</b> It is a very efficient and powerful programming language. \nIt is best used for <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/">data structures</a> and designing system software.\n<b>C is a case-sensitive language</b>.\n\nC programming language is <b>structured programming language</b>, that <b>needs a compiler</b> for compiling the code into object code (.o extension) which can be executed easily.\nWe have listed down all the features of the C language in the next tutorial - <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/features-of-c.php" target="_blank">Features of C Language</a>\n<h4>What is the C language used for?</h4>\nIt is one of the most portable languages and is mainly used for creating system applications that form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating systems.\nC is a <b>general-purpose</b> programming language. \nIt is used for coding simple software, enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations, simple software, etc.<b> </b>\n<h4>Where is C used today?</h4>\nC is used for developing operating systems and Kernel-level programs.\nIt is used for the production of Compilers. \nWe can develop desktop as well as mobile phone operating systems with the help of C, for example, Android.\n<h4>Who created C language and Why?</h4>\nC language has evolved from three different structured languages <b>ALGOL, BCPL, and B Language</b>. \nIt uses many concepts from these languages while introducing many new concepts such as <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php">datatypes</a>, <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/structures-in-c.php">struct</a>, <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/pointers-in-c.php">pointers</a>, etc.\n<b>BCPL</b> was developed by <b>Martin Richards</b>, based on which the <b>B language</b> was created by <b>Ken Thompson</b>. \nAnd then the B language was the language using which the C language was created.\nIn 1989, the language was formalized by <b>American National Standard Institute</b>(ANSI).\nIn 1990, a version of the C language was approved by the <b>International Standard Organisation</b>(ISO), and that version of C is also referred to as <b>C89</b>.\n\nAfter the C language was accepted worldwide and programmers around the world started using it, soon, to improve C language further, the work on the development of C++ language started.\nThe <b>idea behind</b> creating C language was to create an <b>easy language</b> that requires a <b>simple compiler</b> (to translate the code from English to binary (0\'s and 1\'s that computer understands)) and to enable programmers to <b>write complex programs</b> in a language that is close to English because earlier programmers had to write Machine instructions which were very difficult to remember.\n<hr>The most popular IDE for C language for beginners is Turbo C/C++. \nIn this tutorial, we will cover the installation steps for Turbo C and will also share a few other IDE(integrated development environment) that you can use for C programming.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;What is an IDE?</h2>\nAn IDE or <b>Integrated Development environment</b> is a software, which has a code editor, along with the compiler of the programming language too, hence you do not need to install anything else.\nAn IDE has all the required features to manage your source code, like File handling, Edit options, etc. \nwhile it also has the support for different programming language environments too, for which it has in-built compilers/interpreters installed.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1631950708-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nMany IDEs allow installing 3rd party plugins to further enhance the features of the IDE.\n<b>Turbo C</b> is an IDE used for writing code in the C language. \nAnd you can also, compile and run your code using Turbo C itself. \n<b>Turbo C++ is the upgraded version</b> of Turbo C, which can also be used for C language programming.\nThe C++ compiler supports the C language syntax as the C++ language is built on top of the C language.\nThere are other IDEs too that you can use for C programming, like:\n\nDev-C++ (Download from here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/">Download Dev-C++</a>)Eclipse (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Download Eclipse IDE</a>)If you are a beginner, we recommend using Turbo C or Turbo C++.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Conclusion:</h2>\nIn this tutorial, we learned what is an IDE or Integrated development environment, which IDEs can be used for C programming and how to install the most popular C language IDE which is Turbo C/C++ step by step.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">First C Program and its Structure</span></h2>\nLet\'s start with a <b>simple</b> and <b>basic Hello World program</b> in C language.\nTo create a "<em>Hello World!</em>" program in C language, you have to use the <k>printf</k> function.\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n printf("Hello World");\n return 0;\n}</k>\n\nHello, World\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/code/playground/c/?id=kB7XiP" target="_blank">Run Code ¡ú</a>\nTo run the above code on your local machine, you will have to install a C language compiler on your Computer/Laptop. \nIf you need help, here is a step-by-step guide - <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/compile-and-run-c-program.php" target="_blank">Compile and Run C Code</a>.\nIf you do not want to install the C compiler on your computer, don\'t worry. \nYou can use our <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/code/playground/c/"><b>Online C Compiler</b></a> to run C programs and Practice. \nClick on the <b>Run Code button</b> above to open the compiler.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Understanding the Structure of C Program</h2>\nGiven below are some of the different parts of a C Program:\nPre-processor\nHeader file\nmain() <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/user-defined-functions-in-c.php">function</a>\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php">Variables in C</a>\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/decision-making-in-c.php">Statements & expressions in C</a>\nAll these are essential parts of a C language program. \nDon\'t worry about all this, we will learn about everything one by one and will clear all your confusion.\nLet\'s start with a basic introduction to various code statements that we used in the above Hello World program.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Pre-processor</h2>\nThe <k>#include</k> is the first statement of any C program. \nIt is known as a <b>pre-processor</b>.\nThe task of a pre-processor is to initialize the environment of the program, i.e. \nto link the program with the header files required.\nAs its name suggests, this line of code is <b>responsible for doing pre-processing</b>, before the actual code (logic) is executed.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1631609728-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nSo, when we say <k>#include&lt;stdio.h></k>, it is to inform the compiler to include the <b>stdio.h</b> header file which is the <b>standard I/O library</b> into the program before executing the program.\nThe <b>standard I/O library</b> lets you read input from the keyboard(i.e. \nstandard in) and then write the output to the console screen (i.e. \nstandard out).\nBy <b>Console screen</b>, we mean <b>CMD</b> or command prompt in the case of Windows OS and <b>Terminal</b> in case you use Linux/Ubuntu/macOS.\nWe can include any number of header files in a C program.\nThe <k>#include</k> is not the only pre-processor. \nWhenever you see any piece of code starting with a <k>#</k> symbol, that means it\'s a pre-processor in the C language.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Header file</h2>\nA <b>Header file</b> is a set or <b>collection of built-in(readymade) functions</b>, that we can directly use in our program.\nHeader files contain <b>definitions of the functions </b>which can be used in any C program\nTo use a header file you must import it into your program by using pre-processor <k>#include</k> statement along with the name of the header file.\nThere are some standard header files that come along with default C installation, like <b>stdio.h</b> header file.\nAll header files will have <b>.h</b> extension.\nWith time, you will have a clear picture of what header files are, as of now consider them as a readymade collection of functions that comes packaged with the C language.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1631609771-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nTo use any of the standard library functions, the appropriate header file must be included. \nThis is done at the beginning of the C source code.\nFor example, to use the <k>printf()</k> function in a C program, which is used to <b>display anything</b> on the console screen, the line <k>#include &lt;stdio.h></k> is required, because the header file <b>stdio.h</b> contains the <k>printf()</k> function definition.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;The <k>main()</k> Function</h2>\nThe <k>main()</k> function is a function that <b>must be there in every C program</b>.\nEverything inside this function in a C program will be executed, hence the actual logic or the code is always written inside the <k>main()</k> function.\nAs the name suggests, this is the main(<em>of prime importance or center of attraction</em>) function.\nLet\'s see a code example,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n printf("Hello World");\n return 0;\n}</k>\nIn the Hello World code example above, there was <k>int</k> written before the <k>main()</k> function, remember? Well, that is the <b>return type</b> of the <k>main()</k> function.\nThe curly braces <k>{ }</k> just after the <k>main()</k> function encloses the <b>body</b> of the <k>main()</k> function.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;The <k>printf()</k> Function</h2>\nThe <k>printf()</k> is a function that is used to print(show) anything on the console as output.\nThis function is defined in the <b>stdio.h</b> header file, which we have included in our C program.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Return Statement</h2>\nA <k>return</k> statement is used to return a response to the caller function.\nIt is generally the last statement of any C language function.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Semicolon</h2>\nIt is important to note that every statement in C should end with a <b>semicolon</b>(<k>;</k>).\nIf you miss adding any semicolon, the compiler will give an error.\nSemicolon (<k>;</k>) is called the statement terminator in C programming.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;How to write a C program on my Computer?</h2>\nAll the C programs can be written and edited in normal text editors like <b>Notepad</b> or <b>Notepad++</b> and must be saved with a file name and <b>.c</b> extension.\nFor example, <b>helloworld.c</b> can be the file name for the Hello World program.\nIf you do not add the extension <b>.c</b> then the compiler will not recognize it as a C language program file.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions, that beginners have when they learn how to write Hello world program in C programming.\n<h4>Name different preprocessors in C programming Language?</h4>\nDifferent preprocessors in the C language are <k>#include</k>, <k>#if</k>, <k>#define</k>, <k>#ifdef</k>, <k>#undef</k>, etc. \nand many more. \nA pre-processor is a statement that is executed before the main code for the C program is executed.\n<h4>What do you understand by the main() function in C language?</h4>\nThe <k>main()</k> function in the C language acts as the entry point of any program or we can say that the execution of the code starts from here. \nThe source code which is inside the <k>main()</k> function gets executed.\n<h4>How comments can be added to a C program?</h4>\nIn order to add the single line comment, you can use slash <k><b>//</b></k> followed by the comment and for multiline comments, you can use the following:<b> /* comment here */</b>.\n<h4>What is stdio.h in C program?</h4>\nThe <b>stdio</b> stands for <b>standard input and output</b> and <b>.h</b> is the extension of the file indicating that it is a <b>header file</b>.\nThe main use of this header file is, that it helps to get the input from the user(Keyboard) and return the output result text to the monitor(screen). \nThere are readymade functions in this header file that we can use in our program, for example, <k>printf()</k> and <k>scanf()</k> functions are defined in the <b>stdio.h</b> header file.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Compile and Run C Program</span></h2>\nTo compile and run a <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/first-c-program.php" target="_blank">C language program</a>, you need a C compiler. \nA <b>compiler</b> is software that is used to compile and execute programs. \nTo set up a C language compiler on your Computer/laptop, there are two ways:\nDownload a full-fledged IDE like Turbo C++ or Microsoft Visual C++ or DevC++, which comes along with a C language compiler.\nOr, you can use any text editor to edit the program files and download the C compiler separately and then run the C program using the command line.\nIf you haven\'t already installed an IDE for the C language - Follow this step-by-step guide to <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/installing-c-language-compiler-and-ide.php">Install Turbo C++ for C Language</a></b>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Using an IDE - Turbo C</h2>\nWe will recommend you to use <b>Turbo C or Turbo C++</b> IDE, which is the oldest IDE for C programming. \nIt is freely available over the Internet and is good for a beginner.\n<b>Step 1:</b> Open turbo C IDE(Integrated Development Environment), click on <b>File,</b> and then click on <b>New</b>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.studytonight.com/c/images/first-c-program-step1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">\n<b>Step 2:</b> Write a Hello World program that we created in the previous article - <b><a href="http://www.studytonight.com/c/first-c-program.php">C Hello World program</a></b>.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.studytonight.com/c/images/first-c-program-step2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">\n<b>Step 3:</b> Click on <b>Compile</b> menu and then on <b>Compile</b> option, or press the keys and press <b>Alt + F9</b> to compile the code.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.studytonight.com/c/images/first-c-program-step3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">\n<b>Step 4:</b> Click on <b>Run</b> or press <b>Ctrl + F9 </b>to run the code. \nYes, C programs are first compiled to generate the object code and then that object code is Run.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.studytonight.com/c/images/first-c-program-step4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">\n<b>Step 5:</b> Output is here.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.studytonight.com/c/images/first-c-program-step5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Run C Program Without using any IDE</h2>\nIf you do not wish to set up an IDE and prefer the old-school way, then download the C compiler which is called <k>gcc</k> from the GCC website <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/install/</a>\nOnce you have downloaded and installed the <k>gcc</k> compiler, all you have to do is, <b>open any text editor</b>, copy and paste the C program code for <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/first-c-program.php" target="_blank">C Hello World Program</a>, and save it with the name the <b>helloworld.c</b> like any other file you save with a name.\nNow, Open the <b>Command prompt or Terminal</b>(if you use Ubuntu or Mac OS), and go to the directory where you have saved the <b>helloworld.c</b> program file.\nType the command <k>gcc hello.c</k> to compile the code. \nThis will compile the code, and if there are no errors then it will produce an output file with name <b>a.out</b>(default name)\nNow, to run the program, type in <k>./a.out</k> and you will see <b>Hello, World</b> displayed on your screen.\n<k>$ gcc hello.c\n$ ./a.out</k>\nHello, World\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Difference between Compile and Run in C?</h2>\nYou must be thinking about why it is a 2 step process, first, we compile the code and then we run the code. \nWe did the same thing with Turbo C and the same is with the command line or Terminal too.\nWell, the <b>compilation</b> is the process where the compiler checks whether the <b>program is correct syntax-wise</b> and whether there are no errors in the syntax, and if the code is fine converts the C language source code into machine-understandable object code.\nWhen we <b>run a compiled program</b>, it is just the already compiled code that is run.\nThis difference is clear when we run a C program using the command line.\nWhen you compile the code, a <b>.out</b> file is generated, which is then <b>Run</b> to execute the program.\nOnce a <b>.out</b> file is generated, and then you make any <b>changes to your program</b> in the source code file, you will have to <b>again compile the code</b>, otherwise, the <b>.out file will have the old source code</b> and will keep running the old program itself.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions, that beginners have when they learn how to write Hello world program in C programming.\n<h4>What do you understand by the process of compilation?</h4>\nIt is a process where the compiler checks whether the program is syntactically correct or not. \nIf there is any mistake found in the syntax then it will throw the errors. \nThe error thrown at the time of compilation is called a <b>Compile-time error</b>.\n<h4>Name the keys used in Turbo C to compile the code.</h4>\n<b>ALT + F9</b> is used in turbo C in order to compile the code.\n<h4>How is a C program run?</h4>\nDuring the compilation and execution of the C program, the compiler generates output files with the same name as that of the <b>C program</b> file but with different extensions.\nThe <b>.c</b> extension file is called the source file that keeps the code of the <b>program</b>. \nNow, when we compile the file, then the <b>C</b> compiler looks for errors.\n<h4>Where can I write and run the C program?</h4>\nYou can use an IDE to write and run the C program by following these steps:\nStep 1: Open turbo <b>C</b> IDE(Integrated Development Environment), click on <b>File,</b> and then click on <b>New</b>.\nStep 2: <b>Write</b> the C program code.\nStep 3: Click on <b>Compile</b> or press <b>Alt + F9</b> to <b>compile</b> the code.\nStep 4: Click on <b>Run</b> or press <b>Ctrl + F9</b> to <b>run</b> the code.\nStep 5: And turbo C will open the console to show you the output of the program.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">What happens when C code is compiled?</span></h2>\nThe C source code compilation process is a <b>multi-step process</b>, which involves the following steps: \n<b>pre-processing</b>,\n<b>compiling of code</b>,\n<b>linking of libraries</b>.\nIn this tutorial, we will learn how the C code is compiled into object code.\nThe process of converting the source code written in any <b>programming language</b>(generally, mid-level or high-level language) into <b>machine-level language</b> that is understandable by the computer is known as <b>Compilation</b>. \nThe software that is used for this conversion is known as a <b>Compiler</b>.\nIn C language, through compilation, the C language <b>source code</b> is converted into <b>object code</b>.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1631951897-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nThe compiler takes the<b> input</b> which is the <b>source code</b> and provides the <b>output</b> in the form of<b> object code</b>. \nThe complete process of compilation in the C language is further divided into four phases:\n<b>Pre-processing</b>,\n<b>Compiling</b>,\n<b>Assembling</b>, and\n<b>Linking</b>\nThe compiler checks the source code for any <b>syntax</b> or <b>structural errors</b> and after checking, if the source code is found error-free, it then generates the object code that has an extension <b>.obj</b> (for Windows) or <b>.o</b> (for Linux).\nLet us now take a look at the different stages of the compilation process in the C language.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Compilation Process</h2>\nAs mentioned above, the different stages of the compilation process are as follows:\nPre-processing\nCompiling\nAssembling\nLinking\nIn the flow chart below we have explained how the compilation process work and what are the different stages of compiling the C language source code.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1621501647-71449.png">\nLet\'s discuss all these stages of the C language source code compilation in the order they are performed.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Step 0: Pre-processing of the source file</h2>\nIn this phase, pre-processing of the source file is done. \nThe <b>Pre-processor</b> is a program that accepts the C source code file and then it performs the following tasks:\nIt will remove the comments from the source code.\nIt will perform the <b>Macro expansion</b> if any Macro is used (Do not worry about Macros, we will learn about them later)\nIt will perform the expansion of the included header files.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Step 1: Preprocessor</h2>\nIt is a program that processes the source program before passing them on to the compiler. \nAt this step the pre-processors used in any C program are handled and the source code is made ready for compilation.\nEach preprocessing statement must start with<b> </b><k>#</k>, where<b> <k>#</k> </b>is called the <b>preprocessor directive</b>.\nEach preprocessing directive is a single-line code statement.\nThe word after <k>#</k> is called the <b>preprocessor command</b>.\nSome of the preprocessor directives are as follows:\n<h4>#include</h4>\nTo include a particular header using the name of the header file into the C language program code.\n<h4>#define</h4>\nThis is used to define a MACRO in the C language.\n<h4>#error</h4>\nThis preprocessor command is used to print the error message.\nJust like the above three, there are many other preprocessors, we will cover them in detail in a separate tutorial.\nHence, the preprocessor expands the source code(adds the required information) and then this expanded source code is passed on to the compiler.\nIt gives the (<b>.i</b>) extension to the <b>source code file</b> which is initially with (<b>.c</b>) extension.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Step 2: Compiler</h2>\nThe expanded code by the preprocessor is then passed on to the compiler.\nA compiler is a program that converts the <b>high-level language</b>(or <b>mid-level language</b>) code to the <b>assembly code</b>, which is then converted into the machine code, which the machine can understand.\nTherefore the preprocessed code given by the preprocessor to the compiler is then converted into assembly code by the compiler, which is then passed on to the <b>Assembler</b>.\nThe source file which got the (<b>.i</b>) extension in the previous step gets converted into (<b>.s</b>) extension by the compiler.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Step 3: Assembler</h2>\nThe assembler converts the assembly code that it gets from the compiler into the <b>object code</b>.\nThe extension of the file in this step becomes (<b>.obj</b>).\nDon\'t think that Assembler is a separate program generating the object code. \nThe Assembler is part of the compilation process of the C language source code.\nWhen in layman language, we say, the C code is compiled, it means the complete compilation process, covering all these steps, is done.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Step 4: Linker</h2>\nA linker is a tool that is used to <b>link all the parts of a program together</b> in order of execution.\nThe code after this stage becomes <b>Executable Machine code</b>.\nThere might be some situations when our program refers to the functions that are defined in some other files. \nOr, if the code for some program is too big, we can break it into two files, which will be compiled separately and then linked using the Linker.\nIn the C language compilation process, the Linker plays a very important role.\nIf your C program includes a <b>header file</b>, and you are using some function defined in that header file, then the Linker will <b>link the required object code</b> for the function in the library, to the <b>object code of your program</b> and package them together.\nSimilarly, if your program code is too big and you break it into two files, then both the source code files will be converted into object code separately and then the Linker will link them and make the code ready for execution. \nThis is also called <b>Separate Compilation</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions related to the C language compilation process.\n<h4>Q1. \nWhat do you understand by the term Compiler?</h4>\nIt is a computer program that is used to translate the source code that is in a high-level programming language or a mid-level programming language into machine code, which can be executed and the machine can understand what to do.\n<h4>Q2. \nWhat is a preprocessor?</h4>\nThe preprocessor is a directive used to instruct the compiler to preprocess the source code before the start of the actual compilation. \nThere are some parts of the C language program that can be specified using the preprocessor, which is nothing but statements to be executed at the beginning of compilation.\n<h4>Q3. \nWhat is the other name of the .c file?</h4>\nThe C language code files which have extension <b>.c</b> are also called the <b>source code file</b>.\n<h4>Q4. \nWhat is the role of Linker?</h4>\nThe linker is used to link all the parts of the program together in order for the execution.\nIf your C program includes a <b>header file</b>, and you are using some function defined in that header file, then the Linker will <b>link the required object code</b> for the function in the library, to the <b>object code of your program</b> and package them together.\nSimilarly, if your program code is too big and you break it into two files, then both the source code files will be converted into object code separately and then the Linker will link them and make the code ready for execution. \nThis is also called <b>Separate Compilation</b>.\n<h4>Q5. \nWhat are the steps of compilation in the C Language?</h4>\nFollowing are the steps of compilation in the C language:\nPreprocessor (preprocessing)\nCompiler (compiling)\nAssembler (assembly)\nLinker (linking)\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">C Language Basic Syntax Rules</span></h2>\nThe C programming syntax specifies the rules for writing the code in the C language. \nIn simple words, these rules inform how to form code statements in a C program:\nHow should the line of code start,\nhow it should end,\nwhere to use double quotes,\nwhere to use curly brackets,\nwhere to use parenthesis, etc.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;What is Syntax?</h2>\nAny language, be it English or Hindi, or Spanish, has a <b>grammar</b>.\nThe grammar defines the <b>rules for using the language</b>, for example <em>how to form a sentence</em>, what different <em>words mean</em>, etc.\nIn a normal spoken language or a computer programming language, syntax means how to arrange words, characters, special characters, to make a meaningful statement, or expression, etc.\nIf you don\'t follow the rules properly then your code will give error.\n<h4>What is Syntax error?</h4>\nIf someone says there is a <b>syntax error</b> in the program, that means you have not written the program correctly.\nYou might have missed some semicolon or some other general mistake in typing the code for the program.\nHaving a <b>syntax error</b> doesn\'t mean your code\'s logic is incorrect, it means you have written it incorrectly.\nOnce the <b>syntax is correct</b>, then only the <b>code is compiled and then run</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;The C Tokens</h2>\nThe smallest individual unit in the C program is known as <b>C Token</b>.\nTokens are either <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/keywords-and-identifier.php" target="_blank">keywords or identifiers</a></b>, <b>constants</b>, <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php" target="_blank">variables</a></b>, or any other symbol which has some meaning in C language.\nThe C program can also be called a<b> collection of various tokens</b>.\nHence the syntax for C language defines how to use these tokens together while writing the C language code.\nLet\'s take an example,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n printf("Hello,World");\n return 0;\n}</k>\nIn the above code, if we take the <k>printf</k> statement:\n<k>printf("Hello,World");</k>\nThen the tokens in this statement are:\n<k>printf</k>,\n<k>(</k>,\n<k>"Hello,World"</k>,\n<k>)</k>\nand <k>;</k>\nSo the C <b>tokens</b> are basically the <b>building blocks of a C program</b>.\nThe picture below shows token in the entire Hello World Program:\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632221462-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nNow let\'s see some important syntax rules, which you must remember always while writing code in the C language.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Statement ends with Semicolon (<k>;</k>)</h2>\nA semicolon <b><k>;</k></b> is used to mark the end of a statement and the beginning of another statement in the C language.\nThe absence of a semicolon at the end of any statement will mislead the compiler to think that this statement is not yet finished.\nAnd it will add the next consecutive statement after it, which may lead to a <b>compilation(syntax) error</b>.\nHere is an example of code with a missing semicolon,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n printf("Hello,World")\n return 0;\n}</k>\n\nerror: expected \';\' before \'return\'\nreturn 0;\n^\ncommand terminated with exit code 1\nIn the above program, we dont\' have the semicolon after the <k>printf("...")</k> statement, hence the compiler will think that starting from <k>printf</k> up untill the semicolon after <k>return 0</k> is a single statement and this will lead to compilation error.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Adding Comments to Code</h2>\nComments are plain simple text in a C program that is not compiled in the compilation process.\nWe can write comments in a program, to explain various parts of the program.\nAlthough writing comments is not compulsory, but it is recommended to make your program more descriptive, and easier for others to understand.\nAdding comments makes the code more readable.\nThere are <b>two ways</b> in which we can write comments.\nUsing <b><k>//</k></b>: This is used to write a<b> single-line comment</b>.\n\nUsing <b><k>/* */</k></b>: Anything enclosed within <k>/*</k> and <k>*/</k> , will treated as<b> multi-line comments</b>.\n\nYou can use both these two techniques in one program.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Example of comments in C language:</h2>\nHere is a simple program to show how to use comments:\n<k>/* \n This is my first program.\n I am very excited!\n*/\n#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n // Printing Hello World\n printf("Hello,World");\n // printf("Useless piece of code.");\n return 0;\n}</k>\nAs you can see in the above code, we have added comments, and have also, commented a <k>printf()</k> statement, which will not get executed.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;More Syntax rules for the C Language</h2>\nThis is just the beginning, as we will learn more concepts in the C language, we will learn the syntax for using all of them along with examples.\nEverything has a way of writing and use when it comes to writing code, and that way is its syntax.\nC is a <b>case-sensitive language</b> so all C instructions must be written in lower case letters. \n<b>main</b> is not the same as <b>MAIN</b>.\nAll C statements must end with a <b>semicolon</b>.\n<b>Whitespace</b> is used in C to add blank space and tabs.\nYou do not have to worry about the indentation of the code.\nWhen we write a function, its body is enclosed in <b>curly braces</b>, like for the <k>main()</k> function. \nWe will learn this in detail when we cover functions.\nThe picture below shows you the structure of the C program.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632223822-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions related to the C language syntax.\n<h4>Q1. \nWhat do you understand by tokens in C language?</h4>\nThe smallest individual unit in the C program is known as <b>C Token</b>. \nTokens are either <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/keywords-and-identifier.php" target="_blank">keywords or identifiers</a></b>, <b>constants</b>, <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php" target="_blank">variables</a></b>, or any other symbol which has some meaning in C language. \nThe C program can also be called a<b> collection of various tokens</b>.\n<h4>Q2. \nWhat will happen if we forgot to use a semicolon at the end of the statement in C?</h4>\nIf we forgot to put the <b>semicolon at the end</b> of any <b>statement</b> in the C language then it will lead to a syntax error. \nIn that case, an error message is issued by the compiler that<b> a semicolon is expected</b>.\n<h4>Q3. \nWhat is a Compilation Error?</h4>\nA compilation error, or compile-time error, is the error returned by the compiler if the syntax of the C program is incorrect. \nWhen you try to compile a program with some syntax mistake, then the compiler will give an error, which is called a <b>Compile-time error</b>.\n<h4>Q4. \nHow to add comments in C?</h4>\nWe can add single-line comments using the <k>//</k> at the starting of the comment text, and multi-line comment by enclosing the text within <k>/*</k> and <k>*/</k> in the C program.\n<h4>Q5. \nCan a program run without the <k>main()</k> function in C?</h4>\nIn the C language, the <k>main()</k> function defines the starting point of execution. \nIf a C program doesn\'t have a <k>main()</k> function then no code statement will be executed in that program. \nIn most cases the compiler gives an error, if it cannot find the <k>main()</k> function.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">C Keywords and Identifiers</span></h2>\nKeywords and Identifiers are the building blocks of any program in C programming.\n<b>Keywords are reserved words</b>, that have some special meaning in C programming.\n<b>Identifiers are names</b>, given to variables, functions, pointers, etc. \nin a program.\nThere are 32 keywords in the C programming language.\nKeywords cannot be used as Identifiers in C programming.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;C Keywords</h2>\nIn C programming language there are some reserved words that are used internally and have some special purpose and meaning, such words are called <b>Keywords</b> or just <b>Reserved Keywords</b>.\nThe meaning and purpose of the keywords cannot be changed.\nEach Keyword is unique.\nThere are only 32 keywords in C programming.\nYou cannot use keywords as name for variables, functions, pointers, etc. \nbecause if you do so, the compiler will get confused and give you an error.\nIn the last tutorial, where we learned <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/c-syntax.php">C language syntax</a></b>, we learned that everything in the C program is a <b>Token</b>.\nYes, <b>Keywords are also tokens</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Code Example</h2>\nLet\'s see a simple C program in which keywords are used,\n<k>int main() {\n int num = 7;\n char ch = \'Z\';\n float pi = 3.14;\n return 0;\n}\n</k>\nIn the above code example, <k>int</k>, <k>char</k>, <k>float</k>, and <k>return</k> are keywords.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Common Keywords</h2>\nSome of the most commonly used and seen keywords in C programs are:\n<k>int</k> - represents integer datatype\n<k>char</k> - represents character datatype\n<k>float</k> - represents floating-point value datatype\n<k>return</k> - Used to return a result from a function\n<k>if</k> and <k>else</k> - Used in conditional statements\n<k>for</k>, <k>while</k>, and <k>do-while</k> - Used to implement Loops\n<k>void</k>, etc\n',
'<h2>&emsp;All C Keywords</h2>\nHere are all the C keywords:\n<k>auto  double   int   struct \nbreak    else  long  switch \ncase  enum  register typedef \nchar  extern   return   union \nconst    float    short    unsigned \ncontinue for   signed   void \ndefault  goto  sizeof   volatile \ndo    if    static   while</k>\nAll these keywords were defined in the C89 standard, which was the <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/overview-of-c.php">first version of the C language</a>, while some <b>more keywords</b> were <b>added in the later C99</b> standard.\nThe keywords added by C99 are:\n<k>_Bool _Imaginary   restrict\n_Complexinline\n</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Important Points to Note:</h2>\nHere are some useful points to remember about Keywords.\nA keyword can not be used as an Identifier (<em>remember this always</em>).\nKeywords must be written in lowercase. \nApart from some <b>C99</b> keywords, all other keywords are in lowercase.\nKeywords hold special meaning for the C compiler, so respect that, otherwise you will get a compile-time error.\n<k>main</k> is not a keyword, but you should treat it as a keyword only. \nBecause this function is a special function. \nIf you name any variable as main, you may confuse the Compiler.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;C Identifiers</h2>\nIdentifiers are names used for variables, functions, structures, pointers, etc. \nin a program.\nIdentifiers are not-predefined. \nYou define them. \nThe names you give to the variables, functions, etc. \nin C programs are identifiers.\nJust like you have a name, similarly in C programming, when we <a href="http://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php">define a variable</a> or a <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/user-defined-functions-in-c.php">function</a>, or a <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/structures-in-c.php">structure</a>, etc. \nwe name them so that it becomes easier for us to identify them and use them whenever required. \nThese names are called <b>Identifiers</b>.\n<b>Identifiers are also tokens</b>. \nAgain, because every meaningful symbol, word, etc. \nin the C language are C Tokens.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632476876-1.png" src="LAZY_LOAD">\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Code Example</h2>\nHere is a code example in which we have used some identifiers:\n<k>int main() {\n int count = 25;\n float price = 78.5;\n return 0;\n}\n</k>\nIn the above code example, <b>count</b> and <b>price</b> are identifiers.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Rules for defining an Identifier:</h2>\nAn identifier can only have <b>alphanumeric characters</b>(a-z , A-Z , 0-9) and <b>underscore</b>(<k>_</k>).\nThe <b>first character</b> of an identifier can only contain <b>alphabet</b>(a-z, A-Z) or <b>underscore</b> (<k>_</k>).\nIdentifiers are case-sensitive in the C language. \nFor example, <b>name</b> and <b>Name</b> will be treated as two different identifiers.\nKeywords are not allowed to be used as Identifiers.\n<b>No special characters</b>, such as a <b>semicolon</b>, <b>period</b>, <b>whitespaces</b>, <b>slash</b>, or <b>comma</b> are permitted to be used in or as an Identifier.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Naming Conventions for Identifiers</h2>\nYou can follow the above rules and use any name, but here are some conventions that C programmers follow:\nYou should use meaningful names, instead of single-character names.\nFor multi-word names, you can use an underscore, like <b>product_code</b>.\nYou should use lowercase characters only.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Using Identifiers and Keywords:</h2>\nLet\'s see a few examples where we\'ll use keywords and identifiers. \nWe will <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php">define a C variable</a> and name it using an identifier.\nWhen we declare a variable or any function in any C language program, to use it we must provide a name to it, that name is then used throughout the program, for example:\n<k>int myvariable = "Studytonight";</k>\nHere <k>myvariable</k> is the name or <b>identifier</b> for the variable which stores the value "<b>Studytonight</b>" in it. \nAnd <k>int</k> is the keyword.\nLet\'s have another example,\n<k>int money;\ndouble salary;</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Example of Valid Identifiers:</h2>\nHere are some valid identifiers,\n<k>total, avg1, difference_1;</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Example of Invalid Identifiers:</h2>\nHere are some invalid identifiers,\n<k>$myvar; // incorrect\nx!y;  // again incorrect</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Using Keywords as Identifiers</h2>\nWhat happens when we use keywords as identifiers?\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\n   // using void as name of variable (identifier)\n   int void = 0;\n   return 0;\n}</k>\n\nerror: two or more data types in declaration specifiers\nint void = 0;\n^\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/code/playground/c/?id=R9EMul" target="_blank">Run Code ¡ú</a>\nThe C language compiler will think that we have mistakenly used two data types together and will give an error. \nBecause <k>void</k> is also a <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php">data type in the C language</a>(hence it is a keyword).\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\nHere are some frequently asked questions related to keywords and identifiers.\n<h4>Q1. \nWhat is the difference between Identifier and Variable?</h4>\nThe <b>identifier is just the name</b> given to the variable, while a variable represents a <b>memory field</b> where some data is stored based on its data type. \nIt\'s just like what is the difference between you and your name? Your name is just a word that people use to call you, while you are a human being.\n<h4>Q2. \nAre Identifiers case-sensitive?</h4>\nYes, identifiers are case-sensitive. \nEverything in C programming is case-sensitive. \n<b>Age</b> and <b>age</b> are considered as different identifiers.\n<h4>Q3. \nCan I use special characters in Identifiers?</h4>\nYou can only use an underscore <k>_</k> special character in identifiers. \nYou cannot use other special characters like <k>#</k>, <k>$</k>, <k>%</k>, <k>&amp;</k>, etc.\nQ4. \nCan I use a number at the start of an Identifier?\nNo, you cannot use a number as the first character in an identifier. \nYou can only use an alphabet or an underscore <k>_</k> symbol.\n\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Data Types in C Language</span></h2>\nAs the name suggests, a Datatype defines the <b>type of data</b> being used.\nWhenever we <a href="http://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php">define a variable</a> or use any data in the C programming, we have to specify the <b>type of the data</b>, so that the compiler knows what type of data to expect.\nFor example, you may want to use a <b>number</b> like <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>100</b>, or a <b>decimal points</b> number like <b>99.95</b>, <b>10.5</b>, or a <b>text</b>, like <b>"Studytonight"</b>, all these values are <b>handled differently by the C compiler</b>, hence, we use data types to define the type of data used in any program.\nEach data type occupies some memory.\nEach datatype has its own valid range of values.\nThere are a set of operations that are allowed for every datatype.\nFor code examples, check out <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/using-datatypes-examples.php">using C Datatypes</a> tutorial.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Primary Data Types in C Programming</h2>\nThe C language has 5 basic (primary or primitive) data types, they are:\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Character (<k>char</k>):</h2>\nWe use the keyword <k>char</k> for the character data type.\nIt is used to store single-bit characters and occupies <b>1 byte</b> of memory.\nYou can store alphabets from <b>A-Z</b>(and <b>a-z</b>) and <b>0-9</b> digits using <k>char</k> datatype. \nFor example,\n \n<k>\nchar b = \'A\'; \nchar c = \'0\';\nchar d = 0; // ERROR\n</k>\nFor <k>char</k> datatype, it is necessary to enclose the data within <b>single quotes</b>.\nYou can perform <b>addition</b> and <b>subtraction</b> operations on <k>char</k> datatype values.\nThe ASCII value of a <k>char</k> datatype value should not exceed <b>127</b>.\n<h3 &emsp;dir="ltr" role="presentation">Integer (<k>int</k>):</h2>\nWe use the keyword <k>int</k> for the integer data type.\nThe <k>int</k> data type is used to store non-fractional numbers which include positive, negative, and zero values.\nThe range of <k>int</k> is <b>-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</b> and it occupies 2 or 4 bytes of memory, depending on the system you¡¯re using. \nFor example,\n \n<k>int a = 5550; \nint b = -90, \nint c = 0; \nint d = -0.5; //invalid</k>\nWe can perform <em>addition</em>, <em>subtraction</em>, <em>division</em>, <em>multiplication</em>, <em>bitwise</em>, and <em>modulo</em> operations on <k>int</k> data type.\n<h3 &emsp;dir="ltr" role="presentation">Floating-point (<k>float</k>):</h2>\nWe use the keyword <k>float</k> for a floating-point data type.\nThe keyword <k>float</k> is used to store <b>decimal numbers</b>.\nIt occupies 4 bytes of memory and ranges from <b>1e-37 to 1e+37</b>.\nFor example,\n<k>float a = 0.05; \nfloat b = -0.005.\nfloat c = 1;  // it will become c = 1.000000 because of type-casting</k>\nWe can perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication operations on <k>float</k> data type.\n \n<h3 &emsp;dir="ltr" role="presentation">Double (<k>double</k>):</h2>\n We use the keyword <k>double</k> for the double data type.\nThe double datatype is used to store <b>decimal numbers</b>.\nIt occupies <b>8 bytes</b> of memory and ranges from <b>1e-37 to 1e+37</b>.\nHere is how we use it in code,\n \n<k>double a = 10.09;\ndouble b = -67.9;</k>\nThe <k>double</k> datatype has more precision than <k>float</k> so <k>double</k> gives more accurate results as compared to <k>float</k>.\nWe can perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication operations on <k>double</k> data type.\n<h3 &emsp;dir="ltr" role="presentation">Void (<k>void</k>):</h2>\n This means no value.\nThis data type is mostly used when we define functions.\nThe <k>void</k> datatype is used when a function does not return any result.\nIt occupies <b>0 bytes</b> of memory.\nWe use the <k>void</k> keyword for void data type.\nHere is how we use the <k>void</k> type with functions,\n<k>void function() {\n   //your code goes here\n}</k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632837298-1.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nEach data type has a size defined in <b>bits/bytes</b> and has a <b>range</b> for the values that these datatypes can hold.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Size of different Datatypes in C</h2>\nThe size of different data types depends on the compiler and processor types.\nIn short, it depends on the Computer on which you are running the C language and the version of the C compiler that you have installed.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;char is 1 byte</h2>\nThe <k>char</k> datatype is <b>1 byte</b> in size or <b>8 bits</b>.\nThis is mostly the same and is not affected by the processor or the compiler used.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;int can be 2 bytes/4 bytes</h2>\nThere is a very easy way to remember the size of <k>int</k> datatype.\nThe size of <k>int</k> datatype is usually equal to the word length of the execution environment of the program.\nIn simpler words, for a <b>16-bit environment</b>, <k>int</k> is <b>16 bits</b> or <b>2 bytes</b>, and for a <b>32-bit environment</b>, <k>int</k> is <b>32 bits</b> or <b>4 bytes</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;float is 4 bytes</h2>\nThe <k>float</k> datatype is <b>4 bytes</b> or <b>32 bits</b> in size.\nIt is a <b>single-precision data type</b> that is used to hold decimal values.\nIt is used for storing large values.\n<k>float</k> is a faster data type compared to <k>double</k>, because <k>double</k> data type works with very large values, hence it is slow.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;double is 8 bytes</h2>\nThe <k>double</k> datatype is <b>8 bytes</b> or <b>64 bits</b> in size.\nIt can store values that are <b>double the size of what a float data type can store</b>, hence it is called <k>double</k>.\nIn the 64 bits, <b>1 bit</b> is for <b>sign</b> representation, <b>11 bits</b> for the <b>exponent</b>, and the rest <b>52 bits</b> are used for the <b>mantissa</b>.\nThe <k>double</k> data type can hold approximately <b>15 to 17 digits</b>, before the decimal and after the decimal.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;void is 0 bytes</h2>\nThe <k>void</k> datatype means nothing, hence it doesn\'t have a size.\n<table border="1" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="1" style="width:100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><b>Good Read: <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/post/understanding-what-are-bits-and-bytes-and-the-difference-between-them">Understand what are Bits and Bytes</a></b></td></tr></tbody></table>\nBefore moving on to the range of values for these data types, there is one more important concept to learn, which is <b>Datatype modifiers</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;C Data type Modifiers:</h2>\nThere are <b>4 datatype modifiers</b> in C programming that are used along with the basic data types to categorize them further.\nFor example, if you say, there is a playground, it can be a park, a playground, or a stadium, but if you say, there is a Cricket ground or a Football stadium, that would make it even more precise.\nSimilarly, there are modifiers in the C language, to <b>make the primary data types more specific</b>.\nThe following are the modifiers:\nsigned\nunsigned\nlong\nshort\nAs the name suggests,\n<b>signed</b> and <b>unsigned</b> are used to represent the <b>signed(+ and -)</b> and <b>unsigned(only +) values</b> for any data type.\nAnd <b>long</b> and <b>short</b> affects the <b>range of the values</b> for any datatype.\nFor example, <b>signed int</b>, <b>unsigned int</b>, <b>short int</b>, <b>long int</b>, etc. \nare all valid data types in the C language.\n<k>long long num = 123456789987654321; // we cannot store a value this big value using int data type.</k>\nNow let\'s see the range for different data types formed as a result of the 5 primary data types along with the modifiers specified above.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;What happens if the value is out of Range?</h2>\nWell, if you try to assign a value to any datatype which is more than the allowed range of value, then the C language compiler will give an error. \nHere is a simple code example to show this,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\n   // allowed value up to 65535\n   unsigned short int x = 65536;\n  \n   return 0;\n}</k>\n\nwarning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]\nunsigned short int x = 65536;\n^\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/code/playground/c/?id=1UZFrt" target="_blank">Run Code ¡ú</a>\nWhen a <b>type modifier is used without any data type</b>, then the <k>int</k> data type is set as the default data type. \nSo, <k>unsigned</k> means <k>unsigned</k> <k>int</k>, <k>signed</k> means <k>signed</k> <k>int</k>, <k>long</k> means <k>long</k> <k>int</k>, and <k>short</k> means <k>short</k> <k>int</k>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;What does <k>signed</k> and <k>unsigned</k> means?</h2>\nThis is a little tricky to explain, but let\'s try.\nIn simple words, the <k>unsigned</k> modifier means <b>all positive values</b>, while the <k>signed</k> modifier means <b>both positive and negative values</b>.\nWhen the compiler gets a numeric value, it converts that value into a binary number, which means a combination of 0 and 1. \nFor example, <b>32767</b> in binary is <b>01111111 11111111</b>, <b>1</b> in binary is<b> 01 (or 0001)</b>, <b>2</b> is <b>0010</b>, and so on.\nIn the case of a <b>signed integer</b>, the <b>highest order bit</b> or the first digit from left (in binary) is used as the <b>sign flag</b>.\nIf the <b>sign flag is 0</b>, the number is <b>positive</b>, and if it is <b>1</b>, the number is <b>negative</b>.\nAnd because one bit is used for showing if the number is positive or negative, hence there is one less bit to represent the number itself, hence the range is less.\nFor <b>signed int</b>, <b>11111111 11111111 means -32,767,</b> and because the first bit is a <b>sign flag</b> to mark it as a negative number, and the rest represents the number.\nWhereas in the case of <b>unsigned int</b>, <b>11111111 11111111</b> means <b>65,535</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Derived Data types in C</h2>\nWhile there are 5 primary data types, there are some derived data types too in the C language which are used to store complex data.\nDerived data types are nothing but primary data types but a little twisted or grouped together like an <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/arrays-in-c.php" target="_blank">array</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/structures-in-c.php" target="_blank">structure</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/unions-in-c.php" target="_blank">union</a>,</b> and <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/pointers-in-c.php" target="_blank">pointers</a></b>.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;int Datatype</h2>\nThe <k>int</k> datatype is used to store whole numbers.\nWhole numbers are values without any decimal part or exponent part.\nThe <k>int</k> datatype can store <b>decimal</b> (base 10), <b>octal</b> (base 8), and <b>hexadecimal</b> (base 16) values.\n<k>// simple int value\nint a = 100;\n// negative value\na = -100;\n// unsigned int value - with suffix U or u\nint x = 1000U;\n// long int value\nlong int long_val = 3500L;</k>\nWith the value of <k>int</k> data type, we can use <b>suffix</b> <k>U</k> or <k>u</k>, to tell the compiler that the value is for <k>unsigned</k> <k>int</k> data type and <b>suffix</b> <k>L</k> or <k>l</k> for a <k>long</k> <k>int</k> value.Learn more about type identifiers(<k>signed</k>, <k>unsigned</k>, <k>long</k>, and <k>short</k>) and how they change the primary datatypes when used with them - Visit <b><a href="http://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php">C datatypes guide for beginners</a></b>\n',

'<h2>&emsp;double Datatype</h2>\nThe real numbers are big enough that they cannot be stored in <k>float</k> datatype, are stored as <k>double</k> datatype.\nIt is a double-precision number.\n A double datatype value can hold above 15 to 17 digits before the decimal point and 15 to 17 digits after the decimal point.\nHere is an example,\n<k>double x = 424455236424564.24663224663322;</k>\nWe should only use the <k>double</k> datatype when we need such large numbers, otherwise not, because using <k>double</k> datatype <b>makes the program slow</b>.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Variables in C (with Examples)</span></h2>\nA variable is like a <b>container (storage space) with a name</b> in which you can store data.\nWhen you create a variable in C programming a new memory space gets assigned to the variable.\nWhile creating a new variable you have to provide it a name and specify datatype for the variable.\nOnce you have created the variable, you cannot change its datatype.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632807040-.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nWhen we create a variable in a C program, the C compiler <b>allocates a storage space</b>, depending upon the data type of the variable(<b>8 bits</b> for <k>char</k>, <b>16/32 bits</b> for <k>int</k>, etc.)\nThen that storage space is given a name which is the <b>variable name</b>.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632808071-.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nOnce a variable is created, we can store value in it.\nWe can change the value stored in a variable, but we cannot change the datatype of the value stored in it.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Syntax for using Variable:</h2>\nHere is how you can <b>create or declare</b> a new variable in the C language,\n<k>data_type var_name;</k>\nwhere, <b>data_type</b> is a <b>valid data type</b> (along with <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php">datatype modifiers</a>, if required) and <b>var_name</b> is the <b>name of the variable</b>.\nFor example,\n<k>int marks;</k>\nHere, <k>marks</k> is the name of the variable, and it can store values of <k>int</k> type.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Assign value to Variable</h2>\nOnce we have declared or created the variable, then we can assign a value to it. \nThis is called <b>variable definition</b>.\n<k>// variable declaration\nint marks;\n// variable definition\nmarks = 10;</k>\nWe can do <b>declaration and definition in a single step</b> too, like this (recommended).\n<k>int marks = 10;</k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1632808033-.png" src="LAZY_IMG_PLACEHOLDER">\nYou can <b>change the value of the variable</b>, whenever you want. \nBut make sure the <b>value is of the correct data type</b>.\n<k>// variable defined\nint marks = 10;\n// assign a new value\nmarks = 33;</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Datatype of the Variable</h2>\nA <b>variable</b> in C language must be given a type, which defines what type of data can be stored in the variable.\nIf you do not provide any datatype, then the C compiler will give <b>compile-time</b> error or syntax error.\nThe datatype can be <k>char</k>, <k>int</k>, <k>float</k>, <k>double</k>, or <k>short</k> <k>int</k>, <k>long</k> <k>int</k>, etc. \ndata type along with modifiers.\nYou can learn about <b><a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php">C Datatypes</a></b> to see the list of various data types supported in the C language.\nLet\'s take an example,\n<k>// char type variable\nchar status = \'Y\';\n// int type variable\nint marks = 95;\n// float type variable\nfloat percentage = 94.6;\n// double type variable\ndouble long = 76.997429;</k>\nIf you try to assign an <b>incorrect datatype value</b> to a variable, then the compiler may give an error, or it will automatically <b>convert the value into the datatype of the variable</b>.\nFor example,\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\n   // assign incorrect value\n   int x = 10.58;\n   printf("Value is %d", x);\n   return 0;\n}</k>\n\nValue is 10\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/code/playground/c/?id=HPlEdX" target="_blank">Run Code ¡ú</a>\nAs you can see in the output, the C compiler <b>removed the part after the decimal</b>, because <k>int</k> datatype can only store whole numbers.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Rules to Name a Variable</h2>\nWhen you create a variable, you should always give a meaningful name to the variable. \nAnd follow the below rules for naming the variable:\nVariable names must <b>not start with a digit</b>.\nThe variable name can consist of alphabets, digits, and special symbols like underscore <k>_</k>.\nBlank or spaces are not allowed in the variable name.\n<a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/keywords-and-identifier.php" target="_blank">Keywords</a> are not allowed as a variable name.\nUpper and lowercase names are treated as different, as <b>C is case-sensitive</b>, so it is suggested to keep the variable names in lowercase.\nLet\'s see a few examples of incorrect names as per the above rules:\n<k>int 1var; // incorrect - should not start with number\nint var1; // correct\nint my$var // incorrect - special characters not allowed\nint my_var1; // correct\nint my var; // incorrect - spaces not allowed\nchar else; // can\'t use Keywords\nint count; // valid variable name\nint Count; // new variable\nint COUNT; // new variable</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Creating a Variable - Behind the Scenes</h2>\n<b>Declaration</b> of variables must be done before they are used in the program. \nThe declaration does the following things.\nIt tells the compiler what the variable name is.\nIt specifies what type of data the variable will hold.\nUntil the variable is defined the compiler doesn\'t have to worry about allocating memory space to the variable.\nThe declaration is more like informing the compiler that there exists a variable with the following datatype which is used in the program.\nWe can even declare a variable outside the <k>main()</k> function, using the <k>extern</k> keyword.\n<k>extern int a;\nextern float b;\nextern double c, d;</k>\n<b>Defining</b> or <b>Initializing</b> a variable means the compiler has to now assign storage to the variable because it will be used in the program.\nWe can even <b>declare multiple variables</b> of the same data type in a single line by using a comma to separate them.\nFor example,\n<k>int a;\nfloat b, c;</k>\n<b>Initializing</b> a variable means providing it with a value.\n<k>int a = 10;</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Difference between a Variable and an Identifier?</h2>\nAn Identifier is a name given to any variable, function, structure, pointer, or any other entity in a programming language. \nWhile a variable, as we have just learned in this tutorial is a named memory location to store data that is used in the program.\n<table cellpadding="10" style="width:100%;"><tbody>\n<tr><th>Identifier</th>\n<th>Variable</th></tr>\n<tr><td>The identifier is the <b>name given to a variable</b>, function, etc.</td><td>While a variable is used to name a memory location that stores data.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>An identifier can be a variable, but not all identifiers are variables.</td><td>All variable names are identifiers.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Example:\n<k>// studytonight is identifier for a variable\nint studytonight;\n// studytonight is identifier for a function\nint studytonight() { \n ... \n\n}</k>\n</td><td>Example:\n<k>// int variable\nint a;\n// float variable\nfloat a;</k>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">C Literals/Constants</span></h2>\nIf we want to use some data value in a C program, we can also <b>directly use a value</b>, instead of creating a variable to store the value.\nWhen we use a value directly in C program <b>without creating a variable</b>, it is known as a <b>Literal</b>.\nA literal is used when we want to <b>use a fixed value</b> in the program, hence literals are also called <b>Constants</b>.\nFor example, <b>1</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>\'Y\'</b>, <b>10.5</b>, etc. \nWhereas, when we use a <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php">variable in C</a>, we can change the value stored in the variable.\nIn the language, literals can be of 5 types, they are:\nInteger Literal\nCharacter Literal\nFloating-point Literal\nString Literals\nBackslash Character Literals (Escape Sequences)\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Integer Literal</h2>\nAny <b>numeric value without any decimal</b> or exponential part, used in the C program is an integer literal.\nInteger literals are of 3 types:\nDecimal Numer (base 10)\nOctal Number (base 8) - Uses digits <b>0 up to 7</b>. \nNumber 10 is the same as 8 for the octal system.\nHexadecimal Number (base 16) - Uses digits <b>0 up to 9</b>, and alphabets <b>A to F</b>. \n(A, B, C, D, E, F stands for 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15)\nFor example,\n<k>Decimal: 7, -10 etc\nOctal: 023, 045 etc\nHexadecimal: 0x2a, 0x521 etc</k>\nIn the C language, the <b>octal</b> number starts with a <b>0</b>,\nand the <b>hexadecimal</b> number starts with a <b>0x</b>.\nYou can also <b>use type suffixes</b> with integer values to make it easier for the compiler to understand the type of the integer value.\nIf you follow the value with <k>L</k>, the compiler will treat it as a <k>long</k> value. \n\nIf you add <k>U</k> after the value, the compiler treats the value as <b>unsigned</b>.\nFor example,\n<k>3500L, 14l // long value\n99U, 89u // unsigned int value</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Floating-point Literals</h2>\nAny valid <b>floating-point value</b> when used directly in a C program, is called a floating-point literal.\nThe floating-point numbers have a decimal part (fraction) or an exponential part.\nFor example,\n<k>100.50\n0.000127\n-0.77E-5</k>\nE-5 stands for 10<sup>-5</sup>\nIf we <b>add a type suffix</b> <k>F</k> or <k>f</k> after the value, then the compiler will treat the value as <k>float</k> type by default.\nFor example,\n<k>127.7F, 40f etc.</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Character Literals</h2>\nA valid character datatype value when used directly in the C program is called a character literal.\nThe character values are enclosed within a single quote.\nFor example,\n<k>\'A\', \'B\', \'c\', \'#\', etc.</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;String Literals</h2>\nA <b>sequence of characters</b> is called a <b>String</b>.\nA string literal is a value with multiple characters enclosed within double quotes.\nThere is no special datatype for a string in C programming, so you cannot create a variable of type string directly.\nFor example,\n<k>"study", "tonight", "c programming", etc.</k>\n',
'<h2>Backslash Character Literals</h2>\nThese are also known as <b>Escape sequences</b>.\nThe combination of characters with the backslash character <k>\\</k> have special meaning for the C compiler.\nA backslash character is used to <b>escape characters with special meaning</b> and make them normal characters for the compiler.\nFor example, if you use a single quotation mark, the compiler will think that it is the starting or end of a character value, but what if you want a single quote character?\nIn the example above the <b>first and the last single quote</b> marks the <b>start and end of the character value</b>, whereas the backslash escape character informs the compiler to treat the single quotation after it as a normal character.\n<table cellpadding="10" style="width:100%;">\n<thead><tr><th scope="col">Code</th>\n<th scope="col">Meaning</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>\\b</td><td>Backspace</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\f</td><td>Form feed</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td><td>New line</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\r</td><td>Carriage return</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\t</td><td>Horizontal tab</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\"</td><td>Double quote</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\\'</td><td>Single quote</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\\\</td><td>Backslash</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\v</td><td>Vertical tab</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\a</td><td>Alert</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\?</td><td>Question mark</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td><td>Octal contant</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\\xN</td><td>Hexadecimal constant</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThe <b>newline</b> and <b>horizontal tab</b> codes are quite <b>commonly used</b>, and you will be using them a lot as you start coding in the C language.\nSo remember <k>\n</k> is for <b>Newline</b> and <k>\\t</k> is for the <b>horizontal tab</b>.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">C Constant value Variables - <k>const</k> Keyword</span></h2>\nIn C programming, a constant value is a value that cannot be changed.\nUsing constants, you can assign a fixed value to a variable, so that the value of the variable is not changed by mistake during program execution.\nTo define a constant value variable you can use the <k>const</k> keyword.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h4>Q1. \nCan I use constants to set array sizes?</h4>\nA. \nYes, you can use constants to define array sizes. \nYou can define the array sizes at the start of the program, and then use it wherever required. \nIn case you want to change the value, you will have to change only a single line of code.\n<h4>Q2. \nShould I create a constant variable or use the value directly in the program?</h4>\nA. \nYou can use a value directly in the program but it is good practice to define a constant value at the beginning of the program by creating a constant variable and then using it in the program. \nUsing a constant variable is a better approach also because it makes updating the constant value, if required, easy, because you just have to update the value of the variable.\n<h4>Q3. \nWhat is the difference between a Constant and a Variable?</h4>\nA constant has a fixed value that cannot be changed whereas a variable\'s value can be changed.\n',

'<h2><span class="orange">Arrays in C</span></h2>\nIn C language, <k>arrays</k> are referred to as structured <a href="datatype-in-c.php" target="_blank">data types</a>. \nAn array is defined as <b>finite ordered collection of homogenous</b> data, stored in contiguous memory locations.\nHere the words,\n\n<b>finite</b> <i>means</i> data range must be defined.\n<b>ordered</b> <i>means</i> data must be stored in continuous memory addresses.\n<b>h&emsp;omogenous</b> <i>means</i> data must be of similar data type.',
'<h2>Some uses of Arrays in C</h2>\nFollowing are some usecases where using an array will make things simpler:\nto store list of Employee or Student names,to store marks of students,or to store list of numbers or characters etc.Since arrays provide an easy way to represent data, it is classified amongst the <a href="introduction-to-data-structures.php">data structures</a> in C. \nOther data structures in c are <b>structure</b>, <b>lists</b>, <b>queues</b>, <b>trees</b> etc.\nArray is a <b>linear data structure</b> which means that the elements in an array are stored in a continuous manner in the memory. \nThis makes accessing the elements easier. \nArray elements are indexed in an order, starting from <b>0 to n-1</b>, where <b>n</b> is the size of the array.\nSuppose we have a classroom of 50 students. \nOur array will consist of 50 elements with indexes from <b>0 to 49</b>, where one place will be there for every student\'s data.\nArrays can be <b>single</b> or <b>multi dimensional</b>. \nThe number of dimensions in an array is equal to the number of indexing. \nA 2-D array (also called a matrix) has two indexes(one for row and other for column) and so on.\nArrays make our work easy because instead of declaring 100 variables, we can declare an array of size 100.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Advantages of Arrays</h2>\nIn one go, we can initialise storage for more than one value. \nBecause you can create an array of 10, 100 or 1000 values.\n They make accessing elements easier by providing random access. \nBy random access we mean you can directly access any element in an array if you know its index.\n Sort&emsp;ing and searching operations are easy on arrays.',
'<h2>Disadvantages of Arrays</h2>\nDue to its fixed size, we cannot increase the size of an array during runtime. \nThat means once you have created an array, then it\'s size cannot be changed.\n Inse&emsp;rtion and deletion of elements can be costly, in terms of time taken.',
'<h2>Declaring Arrays in C</h2>\nLike any other variable, arrays must be declared(created) before they are used. \nGeneral form of array declaration is,\n<k>data-type variable-name[size];</k>\nLet\'s see some code example real quick,\n<k>/* Example of array declaration */\nchar a[5]; /* char type value array */\nfloat ar[9];  /* float type value array */\nint arr[10];  /* int type value array */</k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.studytonight.com/c/images/array-declaraction-in-c.jpg">\nIn the code above, in the first line, <k>char</k> is the data type, <k>a</k> is the name of array and 5 is the size.\nIn the next line, <k>float</k> is the data type, <k>ar</k> is the name of the array and size of array is 9.\nAnd in the last line of code, <k>int</k> is the data types, and <k>arr</k> is the name of the array and 10 is the size of array. \nIt means array <k>arr</k> can only contain 10 elements of <k>int</k> type.\nThe <b>index</b> of an array starts from <k>0</k> to <b>size-1</b> i.e first element of any array will be stored at <k>arr[0]</k> address and the last element will be at <k>arr[size - 1]</k>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Initialization of Array in C</h2>\nAfter an array is declared it must be initialized. \nOtherwise, it will contain <b>garbage</b> value(any random value). \nAn array can be initialized at either <b>compile time</b> or at <b>runtime</b>. \nThat means, either we can provide values to the array in the code itself, or we can add user input value into the array.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Compile time Array initialization in C</h2>\nCompile time initialization of array means we provide the value for the array in the code, when we create the array,\n<k>data-type array-name[size] = { list of values };</k>\nLet\'s see a few simple examples,\n/* Here are a few examples */\nint marks[4] = { 67, 87, 56, 77 }; // integer array initialization\nfloat area[5] = { 23.4, 6.8, 5.5 };   // float array initialization\nint marks[4] = { 67, 87, 56, 77, 59 }; // Compile time error\nOne important thing to remember is that when you will give more values(array elements) than the declared array size than the <b>compiler</b> will give an error.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nvoid main()\n{\n int i;\n int arr[] = {2, 3, 4};   // Compile time array initialization\n for(i = 0 ; i &lt; 3 ; i++) \n {\n  printf("%d\t",arr[i]);\n }\n}</k>\n2  3  4\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Runtime Array initialization in C</h2>\nAn array can also be initialized at runtime using <k>scanf()</k> function. \nThis approach is usually used for initializing large arrays, or to initialize arrays with user specified values.\n \nTo input elements in an array, we can use a <k>for</k> loop or insert elements at a specific index.\nFor example, to insert element at specific index,\n<k>scanf("%d", &amp;arr[3]); // will insert element at index 3, i.e. \n4th position</k>\nLet\'s suppose we have an array <k>Arr</k> of <b>10 elements</b> of type <k>int</k>.\nTo <b>insert elements at each index</b>,\n<k>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\n Arr[i] = i;</k>\nHere <b>i</b> refers to the index of the elements, starting from <b>0</b> and ending at <b>9</b> which is less than 10. \nIn each element, we store the value of its index.\nTo <b>insert elements at each index according to user</b>, we can do the following,\n<k>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\n scanf("%d", &amp;Arr[i]);</k>\nTo <b>insert elements at alternate index</b>,\n<k>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i+=2)\n scanf("%d", &amp;Arr[i]);</k>\nNotice that in the above example, we are incrementing <b>i</b> by 2 each time, <k>i+=2</k> means <b>i = i + 2</b>. \nSo we input only even indexed elements like Arrr[0], Arr[2], and so on.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Accessing Array elements in C</h2>\nWe already know how to access array elements. \nYes, it is using the indexes. \nSo let\'s see a few examples where we will print entire arrays or some specific values, etc.\nTo print all elements,\n<k>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\n printf("%d", Arr[i]);</k>\nTo <b>access and print elements at specified index</b>,\n<k>printf("%d", Arr[0]); //prints first element of the array\nprintf("%d", Arr[5]); //prints sixth element of the array</k>\nTo access elements at alternate index,\n<k>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i+=2)\n printf("%d", Arr[i]);</k>\nIf we try to access elements, on index which is more than the size of an array or less than 0, we won\'t get an error but we will get wrong output (some random garbage value).\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Array Programs in C</h2>\nLet\'s see a few basic programs where we will be using arrays.\n<h4>Calculate sum of all array elements</h4>\nThe following program is used to calculate the sum of all elements of an array.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nvoid main(){\n int arr[5];\n printf("Enter array elements:"");\n for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n  scanf("%d", &amp;arr[i]);\n printf("Array elements are:"");\n for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n  printf("%d ", arr[i]);\n int sum = 0;\n for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n  sum += arr[i];\n printf("Sum =%d", sum);\n}</k>\n\nEnter array elements:3 2 4 1 5\nArray elements are:3 2 4 1 5\nSum =15\n<h4>Copy data from one array to another</h4>\nThis program will copy all the elements of one array into another, we use a <k>for</k> loop.\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n float arr1[5] = {1.5, 2.1, 3.7, 4.2, 5.5}, arr2[5];\n for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n  arr2[i] = arr1[i];\n for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n  printf("%d ", arr2[i]);\n return 0;\n}</k>\n\n1.5 2.1 3.7 4.2 5.5\nIf you were thinking that we can assign values from an array to another using an <b>assignment operator</b>, like we do in variables, <b>NO you can\'t</b>.\n<k>Array1 = Array2;  // error</k>\nWe can also create boolean arrays in C. \nUnlike other data types, boolean arrays have only two values, i.e., true(1) and false(0).\nPlease note that in order to use bool, we use &lt;stdbool.h> header file in our code. \nAlso, there is no format specifier for bool in C. \nWe use <b>%d</b> for input/output.\nSuppose a teacher wants to store the data of assignment submission of her class of 5 students. \nTo do so, she makes use of a boolean array where she inputs "yes" or "no" corresponding to the respective roll numbers. \nFollowing is the code for this example.\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\n#include &lt;stdbool.h>\nint main()\n{\n bool submitted[5] = {\'0\', \'1\', \'1\', \'0\', \'1\'};\n printf("Submission details are:\n");\n for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n  printf("%d : %d\n",i + 1, submitted[i]);\n return 0;\n}</k>\n\n1 : 0\n2 : 1\n3 : 1\n4 : 0\n5 : 1\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Two dimensional Arrays</h2>\nC language supports multidimensional arrays too. \nThe simplest form of a multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. \nHere, we have a row index and a column index. \nBoth the row\'s and column\'s index begins from <b>0</b>.\nJust like a single-dimensional array, we can do Compile time initialization of two dimensional arrays or runtime initialization of two dimensional arrays.\nTwo-dimensional arrays are declared as follows,\ndata-type array-name[row-size][column-size]\nPlease note and remember, the first <k>[]</k> holds row count and second <k>[]</k> holds column count.\n<k>double arr[5][5];\nint a[3][4];</k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.studytonight.com/c/images/two-dimensional-array.jpg">\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Compile-time initialization of a two dimensional Array</h2>\nIf you want to do Compile time initialization of two dimensional array, then here is an example,\n<k>int arr[][3] = {\n {0,0,0},\n {1,1,1}\n};\nchar a[][2] = {\n{\'a\', \'b\'},\n{\'c\', \'d\'}\n};</k>\n<b>Note:</b> We have not assigned any <b>row value</b> to our arrays in the above example. \nIt means we can initialize any number of rows. \nBut, we must always specify <b>number of columns</b>, else it will give a compile time error. \nHere, a <k>2*3</k> multi-dimensional matrix is created.\nLet\'s see a few more examples,\n<k>int arr1[2][2] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // equivalent to {{1, 2},{3, 4}}\nint arr2[2][3] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // equivalent to {{1, 2, 3},{4}}\nint arr3[2][4] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // equivalent to {{1,2,3,4}}</k>\nAs you can see in the example above, first the values are stored in columns, and then if there is any extra value, it goes to next row.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Which storage class should be used and when</h2>\nTo improve the speed of execution of the program and to carefully use the memory space occupied by the variables, following points should be kept in mind while using storage classes:\nWe should use <k>static</k> storage class only when we want the value of the variable to remain same every time we call it using different function calls.We should use <k>register</k> storage class only for those variables that are used in our program very oftenly. \nCPU registers are limited and thus should be used carefully.We should use external or global storage class only for those variables that are being used by almost all the functions in the program.If we do not have the purpose of any of the above mentioned storage classes, then we should use the automatic storage class.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Functions in C</span></h2>\nA <b>function</b> is a block of code that performs a particular task.\n \nThere are many situations where we might need to write same line of code for more than once in a program. \nThis may lead to unnecessary repetition of code, bugs and even becomes boring for the programmer. \nSo, C language provides an approach in which you can declare and define a group of statements once in the form of a function and it can be called and used whenever required.\nThese functions defined by the user are also know as <b>User-defined Functions</b>\nC functions can be classified into two categories,\n\n<b>Library functions</b> \n<b>User-defined functions</b><img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.studytonight.com/c/images/types-of-function-in-c.gif">\n<b>Library functions</b> are those functions which are already defined in C library, example <k>printf()</k>, <k>scanf()</k>, <k>strcat()</k> etc. \nYou just need to include appropriate header files to use these functions. \nThese are already declared and defined in C libraries.\nA <b>User-defined functions</b> on the other hand, are those functions which are defined by the user at the time of writing program. \nThese functions are made for code reusability and for saving time and space.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Benefits of Using Functions</h2>\n\nIt provides modularity to your program\'s structure.It makes your code reusable. \nYou &emsp;just have to call the function by its name to use it, wherever required.In case of large programs with thousands of code lines, debugging and editing becomes easier if you use functions.It makes the program more readable and easy to understand.',
'<h2>Function Declaration</h2>\nGeneral syntax for function declaration is,\n<k>returntype functionName(type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2,...);</k>\nLike any variable or an array, a function must also be declared before its used. \nFunction declaration informs the compiler about the function name, parameters is accept, and its return type. \nThe actual body of the function can be defined separately. \nIt\'s also called as <b>Function Prototyping</b>. \nFunction declaration consists of 4 parts.\nreturntypefunction nameparameter listterminating semicolon<h4>returntype</h4> \nWhen a function is declared to perform some sort of calculation or any operation and is expected to provide with some result at the end, in such cases, a <k>return</k> statement is added at the end of function body. \nReturn type specifies the type of value(<k>int</k>, <k>float</k>, <k>char</k>, <k>double</k>) that function is expected to return to the program which called the function.\n<b>Note:</b> In case your function doesn\'t return any value, the return type would be <k>void</k>.\n<h4>functionName</h4>  \nFunction name is an <a href="/c/keywords-and-identifier.php" target="_blank">identifier</a> and it specifies the name of the function. \nThe function name is any valid C identifier and therefore must follow the same naming rules like other variables in C language.\n<h4>parameter list</h4>\nThe parameter list declares the type and number of arguments that the function expects when it is called. \nAlso, the parameters in the parameter list receives the argument values when the function is called. \nThey are often referred as <b>formal parameters</b>.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Time for an Example</h2>\nLet\'s write a simple program with a <k>main()</k> function, and a user defined function to multiply two numbers, which will be called from the <k>main()</k> function.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nint multiply(int a, int b);  // function declaration\nint main() \n{\n int i, j, result;\n printf("Please enter 2 numbers you want to multiply...");\n scanf("%d%d", &amp;i, &amp;j);\n result = multiply(i, j);  // function call\n printf("The result of muliplication is: %d", result);\n return 0;\n}\nint multiply(int a, int b)\n{\n return (a*b);    // function defintion, this can be done in one line\n}</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Function definition Syntax</h2>\nJust like in the example above, the general syntax of function definition is,\n<k>returntype functionName(type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2,...)\n{\n // function body goes here\n}</k>\nThe first line <i>returntype</i> <b>functionName(type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2,...)</b> is known as <b>function header</b> and the statement(s) within curly braces is called <b>function body</b>.\n<b>Note:</b> While defining a function, there is no semicolon(<k>;</k>) after the parenthesis in the function header, unlike while declaring the function or calling the function.\n<h4>functionbody</h4> \nThe function body contains the declarations and the statements(algorithm) necessary for performing the required task. \nThe body is enclosed within curly braces <k>{ ... \n}</k> and consists of three parts.\n\n<b>local</b> variable declaration(if required).\n<b>f&emsp;unction statements</b> to perform the task inside the function.a <b>return</b> statement to return the result evaluated by the function(if return type is <k>void</k>, then no return statement is required).',
'<h2>Calling a function</h2>\nWhen a function is called, control of the program gets transferred to the function.\n<k>functionName(argument1, argument2,...);</k>\nIn the example above, the statement <k>multiply(i, j);</k> inside the <k>main()</k> function is function call.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Passing Arguments to a function</h2>\nArguments are the values specified during the function call, for which the formal parameters are declared while defining the function.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.studytonight.com/c/images/functions-and-arguments.gif">\nIt is possible to have a function with parameters but no return type. \nIt is not necessary, that if a function accepts parameter(s), it must return a result too.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.studytonight.com/c/images/passing-argument-c-functions.jpg">\nWhile declaring the function, we have declared two parameters <k>a</k> and <k>b</k> of type <k>int</k>. \nTherefore, while calling that function, we need to pass two arguments, else we will get compilation error. \nAnd the two arguments passed should be received in the function definition, which means that the function header in the function definition should have the two parameters to hold the argument values. \nThese received arguments are also known as <b>formal parameters</b>. \nThe name of the variables while declaring, calling and defining a function can be different.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Returning a value from function</h2>\nA function may or may not return a result. \nBut if it does, we must use the <k>return</k> statement to output the result. \n<k>return</k> statement also ends the function execution, hence it must be the last statement of any function. \nIf you write any statement after the <k>return</k> statement, it won\'t be executed.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.studytonight.com/c/images/return-statement-c-functions.jpg">\nThe datatype of the value returned using the <k>return</k> statement should be same as the return type mentioned at function declaration and definition. \nIf any of it mismatches, you will get compilation error.\nIn the next tutorial, we will learn about the different types of user defined functions in C language and the concept of Nesting of functions which is used in recursion.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Type of User-defined Functions in C</span></h2>\nThere can be 4 different types of user-defined <a href="user-defined-functions-in-c.php" target="_blank">functions</a>, they are:\n\nFunction with no arguments and no return value\n Function with no arguments and a return value\n Function with arguments and no return value\n Function with arguments and a return valueBelow, we will discuss about all these types, along with program examples.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Function with no arguments and no return value</h2>\nSuch functions can either be used to display information or they are completely dependent on user inputs.\nBelow is an example of a function, which takes 2 numbers as input from user, and display which is the greater number.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nvoid greatNum();    // function declaration\nint main()\n{\n greatNum();  // function call\n return 0;\n}\nvoid greatNum()  // function definition\n{\n int i, j;\n printf("Enter 2 numbers that you want to compare...");\n scanf("%d%d", &amp;i, &amp;j);\n if(i > j) {\n  printf("The greater number is: %d", i);\n }\n else {\n  printf("The greater number is: %d", j);\n }\n}</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Function with no arguments and a return value</h2>\nWe have modified the above example to make the function <k>greatNum()</k> return the number which is greater amongst the 2 input numbers.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nint greatNum();    // function declaration\nint main()\n{\n int result;\n result = greatNum();  // function call\n printf("The greater number is: %d", result);\n return 0;\n}\nint greatNum()  // function definition\n{\n int i, j, greaterNum;\n printf("Enter 2 numbers that you want to compare...");\n scanf("%d%d", &amp;i, &amp;j);\n if(i > j) {\n  greaterNum = i;\n }\n else {\n  greaterNum = j;\n }\n // returning the result\n return greaterNum;\n}</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Function with arguments and no return value</h2>\nWe are using the same function as example again and again, to demonstrate that to solve a problem there can be many different ways.\nThis time, we have modified the above example to make the function <k>greatNum()</k> take two <k>int</k> values as arguments, but it will not be returning anything.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nvoid greatNum(int a, int b);    // function declaration\nint main()\n{\n int i, j;\n printf("Enter 2 numbers that you want to compare...");\n scanf("%d%d", &amp;i, &amp;j);\n greatNum(i, j);  // function call\n return 0;\n}\nvoid greatNum(int x, int y)  // function definition\n{\n if(x > y) {\n  printf("The greater number is: %d", x);\n }\n else {\n  printf("The greater number is: %d", y);\n }\n}</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Function with arguments and a return value</h2>\nThis is the best type, as this makes the function completely independent of inputs and outputs, and only the logic is defined inside the function body.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nint greatNum(int a, int b);    // function declaration\nint main()\n{\n int i, j, result;\n printf("Enter 2 numbers that you want to compare...");\n scanf("%d%d", &amp;i, &amp;j);\n result = greatNum(i, j); // function call\n printf("The greater number is: %d", result);\n return 0;\n}\nint greatNum(int x, int y)  // function definition\n{\n if(x > y) {\n  return x;\n }\n else {\n  return y;\n }\n}</k>\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Nesting of Functions</h2>\nC language also allows nesting of functions i.e to use/call one function inside another function\'s body. \nWe must be careful while using nested functions, because it may lead to infinite nesting.\n<k>\nfunction1()\n{\n // function1 body here\n function2();\n // function1 body here\n}</k>\nIf function2() also has a call for function1() inside it, then in that case, it will lead to an infinite nesting. \nThey will keep calling each other and the program will never terminate.\nNot able to understand? Lets consider that inside the <k>main()</k> function, function1() is called and its execution starts, then inside function1(), we have a call for function2(), so the control of program will go to the function2(). \nBut as function2() also has a call to function1() in its body, it will call function1(), which will again call function2(), and this will go on for infinite times, until you forcefully exit from program execution.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;What is Recursion?</h2>\nRecursion is a special way of nesting functions, where a function calls itself inside it. \nWe must have certain conditions in the function to break out of the recursion, otherwise recursion will occur infinite times.\n<k>function1()\n{   \n // function1 body\n function1();\n // function1 body\n}</k><h4>Example: Factorial of a number using Recursion</h4>\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nint factorial(int x);    //declaring the function\nvoid main()\n{\n int a, b;\n printf("Enter a number...");\n scanf("%d", &amp;a);\n b = factorial(a);    //calling the function named factorial\n printf("%d", b);\n}\nint factorial(int x) //defining the function\n{\n int r = 1;\n if(x == 1) \n  return 1;\n else \n  r = x*factorial(x-1);    //recursion, since the function calls itself\n return r;\n}</k>\nSimilarly, there are many more applications of recursion in C language. \nGo to the <a href="programs/" target="_blank">programs section</a>, to find out more programs using recursion.\nNow that we have learned about the Stack in Data Structure, you can also check out these topics:\n<a href="types-of-function-calls.php" target="_blank">Types of Function calls</a>\n<a href="array-in-function-in-c.php" target="_blank">Passing Array to function</a>\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">Types of Function calls in C</span></h2>\n<a href="user-defined-functions-in-c.php" target="_blank">Functions </a> are called by their names, we all know that, then what is this tutorial for? Well if the function does not have any arguments, then to call a function you can directly use its name. \nBut for functions with arguments, we can call a function in two different ways, based on how we specify the arguments, and these two ways are:\n\nCall&emsp; by ValueCall by Reference',
'<h2>Call by Value</h2>\nCalling a function by value means, we pass the values of the arguments which are stored or copied into the formal parameters of the function. \nHence, the original values are unchanged only the parameters inside the function changes. \n\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nvoid calc(int x);\nint main()\n{\n int x = 10;\n calc(x);\n // this will print the value of \'x\'\n printf("\nvalue of x in main is %d", x);\n return 0;\n}\nvoid calc(int x)\n{\n // changing the value of \'x\'\n x = x + 10 ;\n printf("value of x in calc function is %d ", x);\n}</k>\nvalue of x in calc function is 20\nvalue of x in main is 10\nIn this case, the actual <a href="variables-in-c.php" target="_blank">variable</a> <k>x</k> is not changed. \nThis is because we are passing the argument by value, hence a copy of <k>x</k> is passed to the function, which is updated during function execution, and that copied value in the function is destroyed when the function ends(goes out of scope). \nSo the variable <k>x</k> inside the <k>main()</k> function is never changed and hence, still holds a value of <k>10</k>.\nBut we can change this program to let the function modify the original <k>x</k> variable, by making the function <k>calc()</k> return a value, and storing that value in x.\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nint calc(int x);\nint main()\n{\n int x = 10;\n x = calc(x);\n printf("value of x is %d", x);\n return 0;\n}\nint calc(int x)\n{\n x = x + 10 ;\n return x;\n}</k>\nvalue of x is 20\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Call by Reference</h2>\nIn call by reference we pass the address(reference) of a variable as argument to any function. \nWhen we pass the address of any variable as argument, then the function will have access to our variable, as it now knows where it is stored and hence can easily update its value.\n \nIn this case the formal parameter can be taken as a <b>reference</b> or a <b><a href="pointers-in-c.php" target="_blank">pointers </a></b>(don\'t worry about pointers, we will soon learn about them), in both the cases they will change the values of the original variable. \n\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\nvoid calc(int *p);   // functin taking pointer as argument\nint main()\n{\n int x = 10;\n calc(&amp;x);    // passing address of \'x\' as argument\n printf("value of x is %d", x);\n return(0);\n}\nvoid calc(int *p)    //receiving the address in a reference pointer variable\n{\n /*\n  changing the value directly that is \n  stored at the address passed\n */\n *p = *p + 10; \n}</k>\nvalue of x is 20\n<b>NOTE:</b> If you do not have any prior knowledge of pointers, do study <a href="pointers-in-c.php" target="_blank">Pointers</a> first. \nOr just go over this topic and come back again to revise this, once you have learned about pointers.\n',
'<h2><span class="orange">How to pass Array to a Function in C</span></h2>\nWhenever we need to pass a list of elements as argument to any <a href="user-defined-functions-in-c.php" target="_blank">functions</a> in C language, it is prefered to do so using an <k>array</k>. \nBut how can we pass an array as argument to a function?

'<h2>&emsp;Declaring Function with array as a parameter</h2>\nThere are two possible ways to do so, one by using call by value and other by using call by reference.\n\nWe can either have an <a href="arrays-in-c.php" target="_blank">array</a> as a parameter.\n<k>int sum (int arr[]);</k>\nOr, we can have a <a href="pointers-in-c.php" target="_blank">pointers</a> in the parameter list, to hold the base address of our array.\n<k>int sum (int* ptr);</k>\nWe will study the second way in details later when we will study pointers.\n',
'<h2>&emsp;Returning an Array from a function</h2>\nWe don\'t return an array from functions, rather we return a pointer holding the base address of the array to be returned. \nBut we must, make sure that the array exists after the function ends i.e. \nthe array is not local to the function.\n<k>int* sum (int x[])\n{\n // statements\n return x ;\n}</k>\nWe will discuss about this when we will study pointers with arrays.\n',

'<h2>&emsp;Accessing Structure Members</h2>\nStructure members can be accessed and assigned values in a number of ways. \nStructure members have no meaning individually without the structure. \nIn order to assign a value to any structure member, the member name must be linked with the <b>structure</b> variable using a dot <k>.</k> operator also called <b>period</b> or <b>member access</b> operator.\n<b>For example:</b>\n<k>#include&lt;stdio.h>\n#include&lt;string.h>\nstruct Student\n{\n char name[25];\n int age;\n char branch[10];\n //F for female and M for male\n char gender;\n};\nint main()\n{\n struct Student s1;\n /*\n  s1 is a variable of Student type and \n  age is a member of Student\n */\n s1.age = 18;\n /*\n  using string function to add name\n */\n strcpy(s1.name, "Viraaj");\n /*\n  displaying the stored values\n */\n printf("Name of Student 1: %s\n", s1.name);\n printf("Age of Student 1: %d\n", s1.age);\n return 0;\n}</k>\nName of Student 1: Viraaj\nAge of Student 1: 18\nWe can also use <k>scanf()</k> to give values to structure members through terminal.\n<k>scanf(" %s ", s1.name);\nscanf(" %d ", &amp;s1.age);</k>\n',

// STRUCT为我们定义的结构体</k>\n但是好像我们一般很少使用函数指针，我们一般使用函数都是直接使用函数调用。\n下面我们来了解一下函数指针的概念和使用方法。\n<h3 id="callbacktopic-0"><span class="orange">1. 概念</span></h3>\n函数指针是指向函数的指针变量。\n通常我们说的指针变量是指向一个整型、字符型或数组等变量，而函数指针是指向函数。\n函数指针可以像一般函数一样，用于调用函数、传递参数。\n函数指针的定义方式为：\n函数返回值类型   (* 指针变量名) (函数参数列表);\n“函数返回值类型”表示该指针变量可以指向具有什么返回值类型的函数；\n“函数参数列表”表示该指针变量可以指向具有什么参数列表的函数。\n这个参数列表中只需要写函数的参数类型即可。\n我们看到，函数指针的定义就是将“函数声明”中的“函数名”改成“（指针变量名）”。\n但是这里需要注意的是：“（指针变量名）”两端的括号不能省略，括号改变了运算符的优先级。\n如果省略了括号，就不是定义函数指针而是一个函数声明了，即声明了一个返回值类型为指针型的函数。\n那么怎么判断一个指针变量是指向变量的指针变量还是指向函数的指针变量呢？\n首先看变量名前面有没有“”，如果有“”说明是指针变量；\n其次看变量名的后面有没有带有形参类型的圆括号，如果有就是指向函数的指针变量，即函数指针，如果没有就是指向变量的指针变量。\n最后需要注意的是，指向函数的指针变量没有 ++ 和 – 运算。\n一般为了方便使用，我们会选择：\ntypedef  函数返回值类型  (* 指针变量名) (函数参数列表);\n比如：\n<k>typedef int (*Fun1)(int); //声明也可写成int (*Fun1)(int x)，但习惯上一般不这样。\ntypedef int (*Fun2)(int, int); //参数为两个整型，返回值为整型typedef void (*Fun3)(void); //无参数和返回值typedef void* (*Fun4)(void*); //参数和返回值都为void*指针</k>\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-1">2. 如何用函数指针调用函数</h4>\n给大家举一个例子：\n<k>int Func(int x);   /*声明一个函数*/\nint (*p) (int x);  /*定义一个函数指针*/\np = Func; /*将Func函数的首地址赋给指针变量p*/\np = &Func; /*将Func函数的首地址赋给指针变量p*/\n</k>\n赋值时函数 Func 不带括号，也不带参数。\n由于函数名 Func 代表函数的首地址，因此经过赋值以后，指针变量 p 就指向函数 Func() 代码的首地址了。\n下面来写一个程序，看了这个程序你们就明白函数指针怎么使用了：\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint Max(int, int);  //函数声明\nint main(void){\n int(*p)(int, int);  //定义一个函数指针\n int a, b, c;\n p = Max;  //把函数Max赋给指针变量p, 使p指向Max函数\n printf("please enter a and b:");\n scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);\n c = (*p)(a, b);  //通过函数指针调用Max函数\n printf("a = %d\nb = %d\nmax = %d\n", a, b, c);\n return 0;\n}\nint Max(int x, int y)  //定义Max函数{\n int z;\n if (x > y) {  z = x;\n }\n else {  z = y;\n }\n return z;\n}\n</k>\n特别注意的是，因为函数名本身就可以表示该函数地址（指针），因此在获取函数指针时，可以直接用函数名，也可以取函数的地址。\n\n<k>p = Max可以改成 p = &Maxc = (*p)(a, b) 可以改成 c = p(a, b)</k>\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-2">3. 函数指针作为某个函数的参数</h4>\n既然函数指针变量是一个变量，当然也可以作为某个函数的参数来使用的。\n示例：\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\n#include &lt;stdlib.h>\ntypedef void(*FunType)(int);\n//前加一个typedef关键字，这样就定义一个名为FunType函数指针类型，而不是一个FunType变量。\n//形式同 typedef int* PINT;\nvoid myFun(int x);\nvoid hisFun(int x);\nvoid herFun(int x);\nvoid callFun(FunType fp,int x);\nint main(){ callFun(myFun,100);\n//传入函数指针常量，作为回调函数 callFun(hisFun,200);\n callFun(herFun,300);\n return 0;\n}\nvoid callFun(FunType fp,int x){ fp(x);\n//通过fp的指针执行传递进来的函数，注意fp所指的函数有一个参数}\nvoid myFun(int x){\n printf("myFun: %d\n",x);\n}\nvoid hisFun(int x){\n printf("hisFun: %d\n",x);\n}\nvoid herFun(int x){\n printf("herFun: %d\n",x);\n}\n</k>\n输出：\n<img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/wqfIPAmgib2XOGmtb2WHcufMNUPn3gqibd1DcbLnouPMbdlNtOKp2pKgfxJvqXmoocwqqGTJxmcz5OAGsYEtfNbw/640">\n\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-3">4. 函数指针作为函数返回类型</h4>\n有了上面的基础，要写出返回类型为函数指针的函数应该不难了，下面这个例子就是返回类型为函数指针的函数：\n<k>void (* func5(int, int, float ))(int, int){ ...}\n</k>\n在这里， <em><k>func5</k></em> 以 <em><k>(int, int, float)</k></em> 为参数，其返回类型为 <em><k>void (\*)(int, int)</k></em> 。\n在C语言中，变量或者函数的声明也是一个大学问，想要了解更多关于声明的话题，可以参考我之前的文章 - C专家编程》读书笔记(1-3章)。\n这本书的第三章花了整整一章的内容来讲解如何读懂C语言的声明。\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-4">5. 函数指针数组</h4>在开始讲解回调函数前，最后介绍一下函数指针数组。\n既然函数指针也是指针，那我们就可以用数组来存放函数指针。\n下面我们看一个函数指针数组的例子：\n<k>/* 方法1 */\nvoid (*func_array_1[5])(int, int, float);\n/* 方法2 */\ntypedef void (*p_func_array)(int, int, float);\np_func_array func_array_2[5];\n</k>\n上面两种方法都可以用来定义函数指针数组，它们定义了一个元素个数为5，类型是 *  <k>void (\*)(int, int, float)</k>  * 的函数指针数组。\n\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-5">6. 函数指针总结</h4>\n函数指针常量 ：Max；\n函数指针变量：p；\n\n数名调用如果都得如(*myFun)(10)这样，那书写与读起来都是不方便和不习惯的。\n所以C语言的设计者们才会设计成又可允许myFun(10)这种形式地调用（这样方便多了，并与数学中的函数形式一样）。\n在函数指针变量也可以存入一个数组内。\n数组的声明方法：int (*fArray[10]) ( int );\n\n<h3 id="callbacktopic-6"><span class="orange">二、回调函数</span></h3>\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-7">1. 什么是回调函数</h4>我们先来看看百度百科是如何定义回调函数的：\n回调函数就是一个通过函数指针调用的函数。\n如果你把函数的指针（地址）作为参数传递给另一个函数，当这个指针被用来调用其所指向的函数时，我们就说这是回调函数。\n回调函数不是由该函数的实现方直接调用，而是在特定的事件或条件发生时由另外的一方调用的，用于对该事件或条件进行响应。\n这段话比较长，也比较绕口。\n下面我通过一幅图来说明什么是回调：\n<img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/wqfIPAmgib2XOGmtb2WHcufMNUPn3gqibdXnsvCOVnvvoALof6um1FWk78jxRBQa5Uibnus21nc9HopcHbBtJVYjA/640">\n\n假设我们要使用一个排序函数来对数组进行排序，那么在主程序(Main program)中，我们先通过库，选择一个库排序函数(Library function)。\n但排序算法有很多，有冒泡排序，选择排序，快速排序，归并排序。\n同时，我们也可能需要对特殊的对象进行排序，比如特定的结构体等。\n库函数会根据我们的需要选择一种排序算法，然后调用实现该算法的函数来完成排序工作。\n这个被调用的排序函数就是回调函数(Callback function)。\n结合这幅图和上面对回调函数的解释，我们可以发现，要实现回调函数，最关键的一点就是要将函数的指针传递给一个函数(上图中是库函数)，然后这个函数就可以通过这个指针来调用回调函数了。\n注意，回调函数并不是C语言特有的，几乎任何语言都有回调函数。\n在C语言中，我们通过使用函数指针来实现回调函数。\n我的理解是：把一段可执行的代码像参数传递那样传给其他代码，而这段代码会在某个时刻被调用执行，这就叫做回调。\n如果代码立即被执行就称为同步回调，如果过后再执行，则称之为异步回调。\n回调函数就是一个通过函数指针调用的函数。\n如果你把函数的指针（地址）作为参数传递给另一个函数，当这个指针被用来调用其所指向的函数时，我们就说这是回调函数。\n回调函数不是由该函数的实现方直接调用，而是在特定的事件或条件发生时由另外的一方调用的，用于对该事件或条件进行响应。\n\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-8">2. 为什么要用回调函i？</h4>\n因为可以把调用者与被调用者分开，所以调用者不关心谁是被调用者。\n它只需知道存在一个具有特定原型和限制条件的被调用函数。\n\n简而言之，回调函数就是允许用户把需要调用的方法的指针作为参数传递给一个函数，以便该函数在处理相似事件的时候可以灵活的使用不同的方法。\n<img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/wqfIPAmgib2XOGmtb2WHcufMNUPn3gqibdlrWqmeJkae6bMeJB6EMIia0SwTCSWKkic6Xff9w4w1j9w6VFqk8UrIkQ/640">\n\n<k>int Callback() // /&lt; 回调函数{ // TODO return 0;\n}\nint main()  // /&lt;  主函数{ // TODO Library(Callback);  // /&lt; 库函数通过函数指针进行回调 // TODO return 0;\n}\n</k>\n回调似乎只是函数间的调用，和普通函数调用没啥区别。\n但仔细看，可以发现两者之间的一个关键的不同：在回调中，主程序把回调函数像参数一样传入库函数。\n这样一来，只要我们改变传进库函数的参数，就可以实现不同的功能，这样有没有觉得很灵活？\n并且当库函数很复杂或者不可见的时候利用回调函数就显得十分优秀。\n\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-9">3. 怎么使用回调函h4？</h4>\n<k>int Callback_1(int a)   // /&lt; 回调函数1{\n printf("Hello, this is Callback_1: a = %d ", a);\n return 0;\n}\nint Callback_2(int b)  // /&lt; 回调函数2{\n printf("Hello, this is Callback_2: b = %d ", b);\n return 0;\n}\nint Callback_3(int c)   // /&lt; 回调函数3{\n printf("Hello, this is Callback_3: c = %d ", c);\n return 0;\n}\nint Handle(int x, int (*Callback)(int))  // /&lt; 注意这里用到的函数指针定义{ Callback(x);\n}\nint main(){ Handle(4, Callback_1);\n Handle(5, Callback_2);\n Handle(6, Callback_3);\n return 0;\n}\n</k>\nHandle() 里面的参数是一个指针，在  main() 函数里调用 Handle() 函数的时候，给它传入了函数  Callback_1()/Callback_2()/Callback_3() 的函数名，这时候的函数名就是对应函数的指针，也就是说，回调函数其实就是函数指针的一种用法。\n\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-10">四则运算</h4>\n<k>#include &lt;stdio.h>\n#include &lt;stdlib.h>\n/* * 函数指针结构体 */\ntypedef struct _OP { float (*p_add)(float, float);\n  float (*p_sub)(float, float);\n  float (*p_mul)(float, float);\n  float (*p_div)(float, float);

}\n</k>\n<h4 id="callbacktopic-11">实例</h4>\n一个 GPRS 模块联网的小项目，使用过的同学大概知道 2G、4G、NB 等模块要想实现无线联网功能都需要经历模块上电初始化、注册网络、查询网络信息质量、连接服务器等步骤，这里的的例子就是，利用一个状态机函数（根据不同状态依次调用不同实现方法的函数），通过回调函数的方式依次调用不同的函数，实现模块联网功能，如下：\n<k>/*  工作状态处理  */\ntypedef struct{ uint8_t mStatus;\n uint8_t (* Funtion)(void); //函数指针的形式}\n M26_WorkStatus_TypeDef;   //M26的工作状态集合调用函数/* >M26工作状态集合函数*/\nM26_WorkStatus_TypeDef M26_WorkStatus_Tab[] ={  {GPRS_NETWORK_CLOSE,  M26_PWRKEY_Off  }\n, //模块关机 {GPRS_NETWORK_OPEN,  M26_PWRKEY_On  }\n,   //模块开机 {GPRS_NETWORK_Start,   M26_Work_Init  }\n, //管脚初始化 {GPRS_NETWORK_CONF,  M26_NET_Config  }\n,  //AT指令配置 {GPRS_NETWORK_LINK_CTC,  M26_LINK_CTC  }\n,   //连接调度中心   {GPRS_NETWORK_WAIT_CTC, M26_WAIT_CTC  }\n, //等待调度中心回复  {GPRS_NETWORK_LINK_FEM, M26_LINK_FEM  }\n, //连接前置机 {GPRS_NETWORK_WAIT_FEM, M26_WAIT_FEM  }\n, //等待前置机回复 {GPRS_NETWORK_COMM,  M26_COMM   }\n,    //正常工作  {GPRS_NETWORK_WAIT_Sig,  M26_WAIT_Sig  }\n,   //等待信号回复 {GPRS_NETWORK_GetSignal,  M26_GetSignal  }\n, //获取信号值 {GPRS_NETWORK_RESTART,  M26_RESET   }\n,   //模块重启}\n/* >M26模块工作状态机，依次调用里面的12个函数   */\nuint8_t M26_WorkStatus_Call(uint8_t Start){ uint8_t i = 0;\n for(i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) {  if(Start == M26_WorkStatus_Tab[i].mStatus)  {    return M26_WorkStatus_Tab[i].Funtion();\n  }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n</k>\n所以，如果有人想做个 NB 模块联网项目，可以 copy 上面的框架，只需要修改回调函数内部的具体实现，或者增加、减少回调函数，就可以很简洁快速的实现模块联网。\n\n',

INTRODUCTION</H3>\nEmbedded SQL is an embedding of the database language SQL into a procedural programming language (C in this document) referred to as the host language.\n\n<A NAME = "sqlsyntax"></A>\n<H3>2. SYNTAX</H3>\nThe syntax of a SQL database statement embedded in any host language is as follows:\n\n(margin) EXEC SQL SQL_STATEMENT (terminator)\n\nIn C there is no specified margin, the terminator is ";".\n\n<H3>2.1 An example program outline</H3>\nBelow is given a (very rough) outline of an example embedded SQL program which features the elements common to most embedded SQL applications.\nThe program retrieves an employee\'s <TT>name</TT> where <TT>emp_number</TT> is equal to <TT>10001</TT> from a table called <TT>employees</TT> contained in a database called <TT>frans</TT> and then prints them.\n\n/* Begin program */\n\nEXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA;\n\nEXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION\n   host_name character_string(20)\n   host_emp_number integer\nEXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP\n\nEXEC SQL CONNECT frans\n\n/* Formulate query, something like: */\n\nEXEC SQL SELECT name emp_number\n   INTO host_name host_emp_number\n   FROM employees\n   WHERE emp_number = 10001\n\n/* Print host_name and host_emp_number */\n\nEXEC SQL DISCONNECT\n\n/* End program */\n\n\nAll statements that begin <TT>EXEC SQL</TT> are embedded SQL database statements.\nThe function of some of the above statements are obvious others require some additional explanation as follows:\n\n EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA: Incorporates SQL\'s error handling mechanism (SQL Communications Area).\n DECLARE SECTION: Host variables must be declared to SQL prior to their use in any embedded SQL statements (the variable names used may be identical to those contained in the actual table).\n EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP:\nAn error handling mechanism must precede all executable embedded SQL statements in a program.\n EXEC SQL CONNECT personnel: Initiates access to the <TT>frans</TT> data base.\nA <TT>CONNECT</TT> statement must precede any references to a database.\n EXEC SQL SELECT: This is the familiar SQL <TT>select</TT> statement.\nIt is followed by an <TT>INTO</TT> clause.\nThis associates retrieved values with host variables in the program.\n EXEC SQL DISCONNECT: Severs the connection between the program and the database.\n\nWe are not limited to <TT>SELECT</TT> statements.\nWe can embed any statement available in standard SQL.\nFor example we can create a table as follows:\n\nEXEC SQL CREATE TABLE employees\n    (name c20,\n    emp_number int)\n\nThis creates a table called <TT>employees</TT> that has two fields, <TT>name</TT> a character field with 20 characters and <TT>emp_number</TT> an integer field.\n\n\n<A NAME = "sqlsqlca"></A>\n<H3>3. SQLCA</H3>\nOne of the results of issuing an <TT>INCLUDE SQLCA</TT> statement is the declaration of the SQLCA structure, which can be used for error handling.\nThis structure is as follows:\n typedef struct {\n  char sqlcaid[8];\n  long sqlcabc;\n  long sqlcode;\n  struct {\n    short sqlerrml;\n    char sqlerrmc [70];\n  } sqlerrm;\n  struct {\n    char sqlwarn0;\n    char sqlwarn1;\n    char sqlwarn2;\n    char sqlwarn3;\n    char sqlwarn4;\n    char sqlwarn5;\n    char sqlwarn6;\n    char sqlwarn7;\n  } sqlwarn\n  char sqlext[8];\n} IISQLCA; static IISQLCA sqlca = {0};\n\nMany of the variables defined by the IISQLCA structure are not used.\nHowever the following should be noted:\n\nThe SQLCA is initialised after the connect statement is issued.\nThe fields <TT>sqlcaid</TT> and <TT>sqlcabc</TT> are initialised to the string "SQCLA" and the constant 136, respectively.\nThese values do not change.\nThe nested structure <TT>sqlerrm</TT> is a varying length character string consisting of two variables <TT>sqlerrml</TT> and <TT>sqlerrmc</TT>.\nIf\n<TT>sqlerrml</TT> is set to 1 an error has been encountered, otherwise it is set to 0.\n<TT>sqlcode</TT> is an integer which is set as follows:\n 0 = Statement executed successfully.\n &lt 0 = An error has occurred.\nThe value is the negative of the error number.\n &gt 0 = Statement executed successfully but some exceptional condition has occurred, e.g. no data processed (empty field encountered).\n\nN.B.\n<TT>sqlcode</TT> = 100: empty row encountered.\n<TT>sqlcode</TT> = -40202: row containing empty fields encountered.\n\n The <TT>sqlerrd</TT> array is a set of six 4 byte integers.\nOnly sqlerrd(3) is used to indicate the number of rows affected by an\n<TT>INSERT</TT>, <TT>UPDATE</TT> or <TT>DELETE</TT> statement.\n Variables <TT>sqlwarn0</TT> to <TT>sqlwarn7</TT> denote warnings.\n\nError handling with SQCLA can be done implicitly by using <TT>WHENEVER</TT> statements, or explicitly by checking the contents of the SQLCA fields\n<TT>sqlcode</TT>, <TT>sqlerrml</TT> and <TT>sqlwarn[3]</TT>.\n\n\n<A NAME = "sqldclgen"></A>\n<H3>4. DCLGEN (DEClaration GENerator).</H3>\n<TT>DCLGEN</TT> is a structure-generating utility that maps the columns of a database table into a structure that you can include in a variable declaration.\n<TT>DCLGEN</TT> is invoked thus:\n dclgen language dbname tablename filename structurename\n where:\n\n <TT>language</TT> = The embedded SQL host language, for example <TT>C</TT>.\n<TT>dbname</TT> = Name of database containing the table of interest, for example <TT>frans</TT>.\n <TT>tablename</TT> = Name of table, for example <TT>employees</TT>.\n <TT>filename</TT> = Output filename in which the output declaration is placed, for example </TT>employees.dcl</TT>.\n <TT>structurename</TT> = Name of the host language structure that the command generates, for example <TT>employees_struct</TT>.\n\nThus:\n dclgen c frans employees employees.dcl employees_struct\n\nIf you invoke this you should see output of the form:\n\nINGRES DCLGEN -- Copyright (c) 1985, 1993 Ingres Corporation\nDCLGEN: Working .\n. .\n\nDCLGEN: Describing table \'employees\' .\n. .\n\nThe file employees.dcl created by this command will contain a comment and two statements as follows:\n\n/* Description of table employees from database frans */\n  EXEC SQL DECLARE employees TABLE\n  (emp_number  integer,\n   name   c20);\n\n  struct employees_struct_ {\n  long emp_number;\n  char name[21];\n  } employees_struct;\n\nNote that the structure tag is the structure name followed by an underscore character "_".\nNote also that the length of the character buffers has been increased by 1 to accommodate the C null terminator.\nTo incorporate this file into a C program it must be compiled into c code using the <TT>esqlc</TT> compiler.\nThus:\n esqlc employees.dcl\n\nThis will produce a file <TT>employees.c</TT> as follows:\n\n/* Description of table employees from database frans */\n/* # line 6 "employees.dcl" */  /* host code */\n  struct employees_struct_ {\n  long emp_number;\n  char name[21];\n  } employees_struct;\n\nNo specific reference to this file will be made in the application embedded sql in C source code, however, it is required when this source code compiled.\n\n\n<A NAME = "sqlcursor"></A>\n<H3>5. THE CURSOR.</H3>\nWe have noted that data can be retrieved from an INGRES database using the <TT>select</TT>\nSQL statement.\nHowever the <TT>select</TT> statement is not in it self sufficient to perform this task in embedded SQL.\nThis is because an application needs to process each record, or row, individually.\nThe syntax of the <TT>select</TT> statement offers no way of doing this in an embedded setting.\nTo do this embedded SQL uses a cursor.\nThis can be thought of as a row marker.\nSpecial cursor-oriented statements are available.\nWhat ever the case a cursor must be declared before it can be used.\nFor example:\n\nEXEC SQL DECLARE empcsr CURSOR FOR\n  SELECT name, emp_number\n  FROM employees\n  WHERE emp_number = 10001;\n\nOnce declared we must "open" the cursor:\n\nEXEC SQL OPEN empcsr;\n\n<H3>5.1. "<TT>FETCHING</TT>" the data</H3>\nThe data retrieved using a <TT>select</TT> statement can be assigned to the host variables, a single row at a time, with the <TT>FETCH</TT> statement.\nFor example:\n\nEXEC SQL FETCH empcsr\n  INTO :host_name, :host_emp_number;\n where <TT>empcsr</TT> is the cursor name (declared earlier), <TT>host_name</TT> and <TT>host_emp_number</TT> are host variable names, note the use of the ":" symbol preceding each host name.\nThe statement performs two functions.\nFirst it moves the cursor to the next row in the table, which becomes the current row.\nThen it loads the values indicated in the <TT>SELECT</TT> part of the <TT>DECLARE CURSOR</TT> statement into the host variables.\nThe data can then be processed as required.\nWhen a cursor is no longer required it should be "closed":\n\nEXEC SQL CLOSE empcsr\n\n<H3>5.2 The SQL <TT>WHENEVER</TT> statement</H3>\n<TT>WHENEVER</TT> provides a convenient method for handling error and exception conditions arising from embedded SQL database statements.\nIt stipulates that some action occurs when the program attains a specific condition.\nThe following conditions may be tested for:\n\n<TT>SQLWARNING</TT>.\nIndicates that the last embedded SQL statement produced a warning condition.\n<TT>SQLERROR</TT>.\nIndicates that an error occurred in the last SQL statement.\n<TT>NOTFOUND</TT>.\nIndicates that an SQL <TT>SELECT</TT>, <TT>FETCH</TT>, <TT>UPDATE</TT> or <TT>DELETE</TT> statement affected no rows.\n\nPossible actions may be one of the following:\n\n<TT>COPY SQLERROR</TT>.\nAllows access to the text of an error message.\nIf a program has determined that an error has occurred (<TT>sqlcode</TT> is negative) it can use this statement to put the text of the error message into a variable that can be printed.\n<TT>CONTINUE</TT>.\n<TT>STOP</TT>.\n<TT>GOTO</TT>.\n<TT>CALL</TT>\n\n<H3>5.3 Putting The Above Together</H3>\nBelow the example outline embedded SQL program given in Section 2.1 has been extended to illustrate cursor processing (and to make it more <TT>c</TT> like).\n\n/* Begin program */\n\nEXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA;\n\nEXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;\n   host_name character_string(21);\n   host_emp_number int;\nEXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION ;\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;\n\nEXEC SQL CONNECT frans;\n\n/* Define and open cursor */\n\nEXEC SQL DECLARE empcsr CURSOR FOR\n  SELECT name, emp_number\n  FROM employees\n  WHERE emp_number = 10001;\n\nEXEC SQL OPEN empcsr;\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND GOTO close_empcsr;\n\n/* Loop indefinitely (the WHENEVER NOT FOUND statement will cause the loop to be terminated when the end of the table is encountered.\n*/\n\n/* Commence loop */\n  EXEC SQL FETCH\n    INTO :host_name, :host_emp_number;\n\n  /* Print host_name and host_emp_number */\n\n/* End loop */\n\n/* Close and disconnect */\n close_empcsr:\n  EXEC SQL CLOSE close_empcsr;\n\nEXEC SQL DISCONNECT\n\n/* End program */\n\n\n<A NAME = "sqlexample"></A>\n<H3>6. WRITING AN EMBEDDED SQL FILE IN C</H3>\nTo write an executable embedded SQL in C program the following sequence of steps should be followed:\n\nRun the <TT>dclgen</TT> utility: dclgen language dbname tablename filname1 structurename\nCompile the resulting <TT>.dcl</TT> file using the appropriate <TT>esql</TT> compiler, <TT>esqlc</TT> in the case of the C programming language: esqlc filename1.dcl\nWrite the C source code but give it the post fix <TT>.sc</TT> (not <TT>.c</TT>).\nCompile the SQL routines in the .sc source file into C using the appropriate <TT>esql</TT> compiler (i.e.\n<TT>esqlc</TT> this case): esqlc filename.sc\nThis creates a file <TT>filename.c</TT> which can be examined.\n Compile the <TT>.c</TT> file using cc -Aa -o filename filename.c /cs/apps3/ingres/ingres/lib/libingres.a -lm -lc or using the shorthand version: ingcc -o filename filename.c\nThis then creates a file <TT>filename</TT> which is the final executable.\n\n<H3>6.1 An embedded SQL in C example program</H3>\nWe will now put all of the above together to produce a <TT></TT> program, <TT>tempest</TT>, that retrieves an employee\'s <TT>name</TT> where <TT>emp_number</TT> is equal to <TT>10001</TT> from a table called <TT>employees</TT> contained in a database called <TT>frans</TT> and then prints the result.\nThe <TT>.sc</TT> code is as follows:\n\n/* ---------------------------------------- */\n/*            */\n/*   EMBEDDED SQL IN C TEST PROGRAM   */\n/*            */\n/*      Frans Coenen      */\n/*    (20 March, 1998)    */\n/*            */\n/* ---------------------------------------- */\n\n/* To compile (assuming an appropriate .dcl file exists):\n"esqlc tempest.sc" and then "cc -Aa -o tempest tempest.c\n/cs/apps3/ingres/ingres/lib/libingres.a -lm -lc" */\n\n/* Include statements.\n*/\n\n#include<stdio.h>\nEXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA;\n\n/* Function prototypes */\n void cleanUp(void);\n\n/* ------ MAIN ------ */\n\n/* Top level function */\n void main(void)\n{\nEXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;\n  char host_name[21];\n  int host_emp_number;\n  EXEC SQL INCLUDE "employees.dcl";\nEXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;\n\nEXEC SQL DECLARE empcsr CURSOR FOR\n  SELECT name, emp_number\n  FROM employees\n  WHERE emp_number = 10001;\n\n/* An error when opening the frans database will cause the error to be printed and the program to be aborted */\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;\n\nEXEC SQL CONNECT frans;\n\n/* Errors from here on will cause the program to clean up */\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR CALL cleanUp;\n\nEXEC SQL OPEN empcsr;\n printf("Some values from the /"employees/" table /n");\n\n/* When ever no more rows are fetched, close the cursor */\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND GOTO close_empcsr;\n\n/* The last executable SQL statement was OPEN so we know that the value of "sqlcode" cannot be SQLERROR or NOT FOUND */\n while(sqlca.sqlcode == 0) {  /* Loop is broken by NOT FOUND */\n  EXEC SQL FETCH empcsr\n    INTO :host_name, :host_emp_number;\n\n/* This "printf" does not execute after the previous FETCH returns the\nNOT FOUND condition */\n\n  printf("%s %d/n",host_name,host_emp_number);\n  }\n\n/* From this point onwards the program ignore all errors.\nAlso turn off the NOT FOUND condition for consistency */\n\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR CONTINUE;\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND CONTINUE;\n close_empcsr:\n  EXEC SQL CLOSE empcsr;\n\nEXEC SQL DISCONNECT;\n}\n\n/* ------ CLEAN UP ------ */\n\n/* Error handling procedure (print error and disconnect) */\n void cleanUp(void)\n{\nEXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;\n  char errmsg[10];\nEXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;\n\nEXEC SQL INQUIRE_SQL (:errmsg = ERRORTEXT);

exit(-1);\n}\n\nRemember that a label in C begins with an alphabetic character or an underscore, it must be the first word on the line and must be terminated with a ":", thus <TT>close_empcsr:</TT>.\n\nAlternatively. to select all records in the <TT>employees</TT> table we would define the cursor as follows:\n\nEXEC SQL DECLARE empcsr CURSOR FOR\n    SELECT name, emp_number\n    FROM employees;\n\n<H3>6.2 Discussion</H3>\n<TT>EXEC SQL INCLUDE</TT>: The <TT>INCLUDE</TT> statement provides a means of including external SQL files in the source code.\nHere it is used to include the <TT>SQLCA</TT> structure and the <TT>papers.dcl</TT> files.\n <TT>EXEC SQL BEGIN ....\nEND DECLARE SECTION</TT>:\nHost variables must be declared prior to their use.\nThe declaration types must match those in the .dcl file.\nAlso note the\n<TT>EXEC SQL INCLUDE</TT> "papers.dcl" statement.\nHost variables can be global or local.\n <TT>EXEC SQL DECLARE CURSOR</TT>: Names a cursor for use with a specified set of retrieval criteria.\nOnce declared the cursor can be opened, using an <TT>OPEN</TT> statement, which causes the select statement specified in <TT>DECLARE CURSOR</TT> to be executed.\nThe run time retrieval actually occurs when a <TT>FETCH</TT> is subsequently performed.\nWhen all processing has been completed the cursor can be closed with the <TT>CLOSE</TT> statement.\n <TT>EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP</TT>: The <TT>WHENEVER</TT> statement stipulates that some action occurs when a given condition is satisfied.\nIn this case the action is\n<TT>STOP</TT> and the condition <TT>SQLERROR</TT>.\nThe <TT>SQLERROR</TT> condition is satisfied if <TT>sqlcode</TT> in the <TT>SQCLA</TT> structure is negative (this indicates that an error has occurred.) The <TT>STOP</TT> action simply terminates program execution after printing an error message.\n <TT>EXEC SQL CONNECT</TT>: Connects the program to the named database.\nThe statement must precede any statements using the database.\n <TT>EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR CALL</TT>: Similar to 4. The <TT>CALL</TT> action is used to call a host language procedure (<TT>cleanUp</TT> in this case).\nNo arguments can be passed to the procedure.\n <TT>EXEC SQL OPEN</TT>: Opens the cursor (<TT>empcsr</TT>) for processing.\nA cursor must be opened before any data manipulation statements can be performed e.g. a <TT>FETCH</TT> statement.\n <TT>EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND GOTO</TT>: Similar to 4 and 6. The <TT>NOT FOUND</TT> condition becomes true when\n<TT>sqlcode</TT> in the SQLCA structure is set to a value of 100 thus indicating that (say) a <TT>FETCH</TT> statement affected no rows.\nThe <TT>GOTO</TT> action is the same as the "goto" statement in C (apologies to\nDijkstra!).\n <TT>EXEC SQL FETCH</TT>: Used by the cursor (<TT>empcsr</TT>).\nIt first advances the open cursor one row.\nNext it loads the values indicated in the <TT>SELECT</TT> clause of the\n<TT>DECLARE CURSOR</TT> statement into the host variables listed in its <TT>INTO</TT> clause.\nOnce loaded into the host variables  the values can be further processed.\n <TT>EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR CONTINUE</TT> and\nEXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND CONTINUE: Similar to 4, 6 and 8. The <TT>CONTINUE</TT> action simply means that no action should be taken based on the associated condition, the program proceeds to the next statement.\n <TT>EXEC SQL CLOSE</TT>: Close the open cursor (<TT>empcsr</TT>)\n <TT>EXEC SQL DISCONNECT</TT>: Terminate access to the (<TT>frans</TT>) database.\n <TT>EXEC SQL COPY SQLERROR</TT>: Allows access to text of error messages.\nThus when an error occurs, i.e.\n<TT>sqlcode</TT> is negative, the text of the error message can be put into the name variable <TT>errmsg</TT>) and printed.\n\n\n<A NAME = "sqlnote"></A>\n<H3>7. NOTE ON EMPTY FIELDS.</H3>\nTo list all fields in a table which includes empty fields will result in an error\n(<TT>sqlcode</TT> = -40202) when ever an empty field is encountered.\nWe can test for this and over ride the error.\nHowever the result is that the entry from the last occasion when an instantiated value for the field was encountered is printed.\nThis can not be tested for as entries for fields may correctly be repeated.\nFurther there is no indication of which fields are empty.\nThe error code only indicates that one or more empty field in a row have been encountered and not the position of the field or fields within the row.\nAt present the only solution would appear to be to include a null string in empty character fields and a value of zero in empty numeric fields.\nThis will be quite acceptable in the database under discussion here, however in some applications a numeric value of zero may be a legitimate value.\nIt is hoped that a solution will be found in the near future!\n\n',

i &lt;= 5; i++) {\n  r += i;\n }\n return r;}\n这段代码和状态模式有关系吗？\n\n一点关系也没有。\n\n那这段代码和FSM有关系吗？\n\n这就是个有限状态机。\n\n这里的核心在于：状态是普遍的，有数据就状态，但状态模式是局限与OOP的。\n\n不过，我们日常说的FSM，并不是广义上的FSM，而是一种对状态模式的封装（也可以看做一种模式），它仍然是符合广义FSM定义的。\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-3">FSM核心要素</h3>\n上下文（Context）—— 上下文总是核心要素。\n\n委托，对象将一部分逻辑委托给当前状态（State）。\n\n事件驱动，状态切换多基于事件（含输入）。\n\n状态转移表（状态迁移表）\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-4">状态机的基础实现</h3>\n下面给出基础的状态和状态机抽象，然后基于这个基础实现，来讨论常见的状态机实现中的一些问题。\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-5">状态抽象</h3>\npublic interface IState&lt;E&gt;

{\n \npublic void enter(GameObject entity) {\n \n// 可能是监听实体自身的事件，也可能是监听外部的事件  addEventHandler(EventType.customEvent, (event) -&gt; onEvent(entity, event));\n }}\n看起来是不是没啥问题？\n\n非也。\n\n由于我们在Lambda中捕获了entity，这创建了一个中间对象，这使得我们的单例名存实亡。\n\n这个问题的根本是：状态（State）的上下文不全，状态在处理事件时，缺少Entity这个上下文。\n\n实际上，我们可以通过将Entity 存储在当前状态上，以避免Lambda捕获entity。\n\n// 调整后的State接口\npublic interface IState&lt;E&gt; extends IEventHandler&lt;FSMEvent&gt; {\n// 进入状态前调用 void setEntity(E entity);\n// 进入状态时调用 void enter();\n// 每帧调用 void execute(); \n// 退出状态调用 void exit();\n// 收到外部事件 -- 继承自EvntHandler接口 @Override void onEvent(FSMEvent event);}\n// 具体状态示例：\npublic class MyState implements IState&lt;GameObject&gt; {\n private GameObject entity;\n @Override \npublic void setEntity(GameObject entity) {\n  this.entity = entity;\n  }\n @Override \npublic void enter() {\n \n// 自身便是EventHandler  addEventHandler(EventType.customEvent,  this);\n }\n @Override \npublic void onEvent(FSMEvent event) {\n \n//...\n\n   }}\n\n对应的，我们需要调整一下状态机的实现，这里只写出changeState方法的修改：\n\n\npublic class StateMachine&lt;E, S extends IState&gt; {\n// 请求切换到新状态 \npublic void changeState(S newState) {\n  if (curState != null) {\n   curState.exit();\n  \n// 退出状态后清理上下文   curState.setEntity(null);\n  }\n  curState = newState;\n  if (newState != null) {\n  \n// 进入状态前注入上下文   newState.setEntity(entity);\n    newState.enter();\n  }\n }}\n不过，这么修改以后，State便不能是单例。\n\nQ：那如果不主动监听事件，总是外部推送事件给当前状态，可行吗？\n\nA：怎么说呢，我回想了下历史经历的需求，多数情况下可行。\n\n我说个不可行的例子，假设现在有个AI需求是：当周围有敌人施放技能时，如果和对方距离小于5m，则后退一定距离。\n\n现在，我们需要做两件事：\n维护一定范围内的对象列表 —— 不仅仅是敌人。\n\n监听周围对象施放技能事件。\n\n现在，我们必须在目标实体上注册我们的监听器，否则目标对象在施放技能时将不能确定事件的广播范围。\n\n有人可能说：广播场景上所有实体不就行了？\n\n单从逻辑的正确性上讲，确实是可以；\n\n但从性能上讲，广播所有实体将快速耗尽机器的计算资源 —— 观察者模式、发布订阅模式的一个重要作用便是：消息（事件）分流，将广播变为组播。\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-9">通过Context监听事件</h3>\n要保持单例状态，这个问题的正确解法是：通过上下文（Context）来监听事件。\n\n注意我们在前文提到的Entity误区，State依赖的其实是上下文，而不单纯是Entity，只是多数情况下确实只依赖Entity便足够；\n\n这里我们将State的依赖恢复为Context。\n\n修改后的State接口如下：\n\n\npublic IState&lt;E&gt; {\n// 进入状态时调用 void enter(FSMContext&lt;E&gt; ctx);\n// 每帧调用 void execute(FSMContext&lt;E&gt; ctx); \n// 退出状态调用 void exit(FSMContext&lt;E&gt; ctx);\n// 收到外部事件 void onEvent(FSMContext&lt;E&gt; ctx, FSMEvent event);}\n\nFSMContext的定义如下：\n\n// Context作为一切逻辑的入口，StateMachine隐藏在Context中\npublic class FSMContext&lt;E&gt; implements IEventHandler&lt;FSMEvent&gt; {\n private E entity;\n private StateMachine&lt;E&gt; stateMachine;\n\npublic void update() {\n  stateMachine.update(this);\n }\n \npublic void changeState(IState nextState) {\n  stateMachine.changeState(this, nextState);\n }\n// 所有的外部事件，先回调到Context，再通过Context转发到StateMachine     \npublic void onEvent(FSMEvent fsmEvent) {\n  stateMachine.onEvent(this, fsmEvent);\n }}\n\n具体状态监听事件的调整如下：\n\n\npublic class MyState implements IState&lt;GameObject&gt; {\n@Override \npublic void enter(FSMContext&lt;GameObject&gt; ctx) {\n \n// 使用ctx充当EventHandler  addEventHandler(EventType.customEvent, ctx);\n }}\n\n虽然通过Context监听事件，可以避免lambda捕获上下文，但这种方案也有一些问题：\n将事件先回调到Context，再转发到StateMachine并不总是合理，这可能产生逻辑上的变化。\n\n比如：在游戏AI中，FSM通常还包含全局状态（globalState），将事件转发至StateMachine可能产生不期望的逻辑。\n\nContext 承担了不必要的职责，既让Context变得复杂，也让使用者感觉莫名其妙。\n\n说实话，如非必要，我一般不会选择单例 —— 单例会让许多问题都变得麻烦；\n\n就游戏中的FSM而言，我通常都不使用单例，因为节省的内存太有限了，真正消耗的内存的地方根本不在这里。\n\nPS：这里给大家留几个思考。\n\nFSMContext 和 StateMachine 是否可以合并？\n\n如果可以合并，那么应当保留谁？\n\n将实体（entity） 替换为 黑板（blackboard），这套结构发生了什么变化？\n\n将FSMContext 替换为 AIComponent，这套结构又发生了什么变化？\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-10">数据和行为分离的状态模式</h3>\n在我第一个项目中，还出现了数据和行为分离的状态模式，State仅仅是数据，State的行为全部委托给StateHandler。\n\n以GameObject的AI设计为例，其代码大概是这样的：\n\n\npublic interface IState {\n StateType getType();}\n// 行为转移到StateHandler类\npublic interface StateHandler {\n// 进入状态时调用 void enter(GameObject entity, IState state);\n// 每帧调用 void execute(GameObject entity, IState state); \n// 退出状态调用 void exit(GameObject entity, IState state);\n// 收到外部消息 void onMessage(GameObject entity, IState state, Telegram telegram);}\n// 对象的AI组件\npublic class GameObjectAI {\n private GameObject entity;\n private IState curState;\n private final EnumMap&lt;StateType, StateHandler&gt; handlerMap = new EnumMap&lt;&gt;(StateType.class);\n\npublic void registerHandler(StateType stateType, StateHandler handler) {\n  handlerMap.put(stateType, handler);\n }\n \npublic StateHandler getHandler(StateType stateType) {\n  return handlerMap.get(stateType);\n }\n \npublic void update() {\n  handlerMap.get(curState.getType()).execute(entity, curState);\n }\n \npublic void onMessage(Telegram telegram) {\n  handlerMap.get(curState.getType()).onMessage(entity, curState, telegram);\n }}\n\n说实话，这套设计在我离职时（入职三年）都没有理解得很好。\n\n这个设计，不止我有疑惑，另一个维护场景内代码的同事也有这个疑惑，因为这样写有一个很大的问题：总是要多写一个Handler类，还总是需要向下类型转换。\n\n后来，我和同事问了Leader，Leader并未对我们做过多的解释，只是简单地说了两句：数据和行为分离，有更好的扩展性；\n\n不过多数情况下，我们也确实不需要这么高的扩展性，你们也可以不按照这种方式写。\n\n说实话，我当时并没听懂，那时的我还是一个菜鸟，在代码设计上的思考还很欠缺。\n\n后来，我和同事在写副本玩法时，便不再按照State + StateHandler 的方式组织代码，只有AI模块仍然按照这种方式扩展。\n\n这套设计，我认为多数读者是没有见过的，也看不明白这么设计有什么好处，状态的逻辑明明能写在State类中，为什么要舍近求远写在StateHandler类中呢？\n\n就这里的FSM例子，我觉得不太能体现出“更好的扩展性”这一点。\n\n数据和行为分离具有更好的扩展性，主要体现在对象的行为可能产生【多维度的变化】时。\n\n如果用继承来实现多维度的行为变化，一旦出现不同行为之间的组合，继承体系将难以驾驭，而使用组合则容易实现。\n\n（装饰者模式、桥接模式也是用于解决这类问题的）\n\n<article data-content="[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;block&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;r1WT-1723645800222&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;paragraph&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:{},&quot;nodes&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;8YJn-1723645800220&quot;,&quot;leaves&quot;:[{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;这里我补充一个优点：&quot;,&quot;marks&quot;:[]},{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;减少了数据类的类层次&quot;,&quot;marks&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;color&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;#F33232&quot;}]},{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;

}\npublic class MyState extends State {\n \npublic void execute(FSMContext ctx) {\n \n// 先设置执行结果，然后调用changeState  setStatus(Status.SUCCESS);\n  ctx.changeState(nextState);\n  return;\n }}\nPS：状态机可以在ChangeState的时候检查任务的status，如果未赋值，可抛出异常或统一设置为取消。\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-15">更适合执行而非决策</h3>\n在基础的FSM实现中，State不包含运行结果，FSM只是简单的执行当前状态，并响应状态切换。\n\n因此FSM并不是控制器，而只是执行器 —— 缺少决策逻辑。\n\n而在游戏AI中，决策是核心，执行是其次。\n\n所以，不论是FSM，还是HFSM，都难以胜任复杂的游戏AI —— 因为它们做出的决策是简单的，“缺少思考”的。\n\n<h3 id="FSMtopic-16">基础状态机的优点</h3>\n三点：简单，高效，强大。\n\n基础的FSM实现是非常简单的，稍有编程经验的程序员都能照猫画虎，很快学会；\n\n而又因为FSM的实现简单，因此其几乎没有额外的开销，因此是高性能的 —— 比行为树高N倍。\n\n不过，虽然FSM的实现是简单的，但FSM并不弱小，反而非常强大，因为FSM可以模拟我们遇见的大部分事物；\n\n所以，有限状态机（FSM）永远是你最有用的工具之一，属于必须掌握的技术。\n\n',
'<h2>事件驱动的含义 Event-driven programming</h2>\n是一种电脑编程范型，其中程序的流程由外部事件决定。\n来自鼠标、键盘、触摸板和触摸屏以及外部传感器输入的UI事件是常见的示例。\n\n事件也可能是通过编程生成的，例如来自其它程序的消息、其它线程的通知或网络事件。\nGUI应用程序和网络服务器是使用事件驱动编程的主要范例。\n\n',

The Perl syntax is pretty much that same syntax used in Java, Python, and a number of other languages. The POSIX syntax is the syntax used by grep, sed, vi, etc.\n\n&lt;k>Example of using REG_EXTENDED.\nThis regular expression\n"^(-)?([0-9]+)((,|.)([0-9]+))?\n$"\nAllows you to catch decimal numbers.\n\n#include &lt;regex.h>\n#include &lt;stdlib.h>\n#include &lt;stdio.h>\nregex_t regex;\nint reti;\nchar msgbuf[100];\n\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[])\n{\n while(1){\n  fgets( msgbuf, 100, stdin );\n  reti = regcomp(&regex, "^(-)?([0-9]+)((,|.)([0-9]+))?\n$", REG_EXTENDED);\n  if (reti) {\n   fprintf(stderr, "Could not compile regex\n");\n   exit(1);\n  }\n\n  /* Execute regular expression */\n  printf("%s\n", msgbuf);\n  reti = regexec(&regex, msgbuf, 0, NULL, 0);\n  if (!reti) {\n   puts("Match");\n  }\n  else if (reti == REG_NOMATCH) {\n   puts("No match");\n  }\n  else {\n   regerror(reti, &regex, msgbuf, sizeof(msgbuf));\n   fprintf(stderr, "Regex match failed: %s\n", msgbuf);\n   exit(1);\n  }\n\n  /* Free memory allocated to the pattern buffer by regcomp() */\n  regfree(&regex);\n }\n\n}\n\nman regex.h doesn\'t show any manual entry for regex.h, but man 3 regex shows a page explaining the POSIX functions for pattern matching.\nThe same functions are described in The GNU C Library: Regular Expression Matching, which explains that the GNU C Library supports both the POSIX.2 interface and the interface the GNU C Library has had for many years.\n\nFor example, for an hypothetical program that prints which of the strings passed as argument matches the pattern passed as first argument, you could use code similar to the following one.\n\n#include &lt;errno.h>\n#include &lt;regex.h>\n#include &lt;stdio.h>\n#include &lt;stdlib.h>\n#include &lt;string.h>\n   \nvoid print_regerror (int errcode, size_t length, regex_t *compiled);\n\nint\nmain (int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n  regex_t regex;\n  int result;\n\n  if (argc &lt; 3)\n {\n   // The number of passed arguments is lower than the number of\n   // expected arguments.\n   fputs ("Missing command line arguments\n", stderr);\n   return EXIT_FAILURE;\n }\n\n  result = regcomp (&regex, argv[1], REG_EXTENDED);\n  if (result)\n {\n   // Any value different from 0 means it was not possible to \n   // compile the regular expression, either for memory problems\n   // or problems with the regular expression syntax.\n   if (result == REG_ESPACE)\n  fprintf (stderr, "%s\n", strerror(ENOMEM));\n   else\n  fputs ("Syntax error in the regular expression passed as first argument\n", stderr);\n   return EXIT_FAILURE;      \n }\n  for (int i = 2; i &lt; argc; i++)\n {\n   result = regexec (&regex, argv[i], 0, NULL, 0);\n   if (!result)\n  {\n    printf ("\'%s\' matches the regular expression\n", argv[i]);\n  }\n   else if (result == REG_NOMATCH)\n  {\n    printf ("\'%s\' doesn\'t match the regular expression\n", argv[i]);\n  }\n   else\n  {\n    // The function returned an error; print the string \n    // describing it.\n    // Get the size of the buffer required for the error message.\n    size_t length = regerror (result, &regex, NULL, 0);\n    print_regerror (result, length, &regex);    \n    return EXIT_FAILURE;\n  }\n }\n\n  /* Free the memory allocated from regcomp(). */\n  regfree (&regex);\n  return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n\nvoid\nprint_regerror (int errcode, size_t length, regex_t *compiled)\n{\n  char buffer[length];\n  (void) regerror (errcode, compiled, buffer, length);\n  fprintf(stderr, "Regex match failed: %s\n", buffer);\n}\nThe last argument of regcomp() needs to be at least REG_EXTENDED, or the functions will use basic regular expressions, which means that (for example) you would need to use a\{3\} instead of a{3} used from extended regular expressions, which is probably what you expect to use.\n\nPOSIX.2 has also another function for wildcard matching: fnmatch(). It doesn\'t allow to compile the regular expression, or get the sub-strings matching a sub-expression, but it is very specific for checking when a filename match a wildcard (it uses the FNM_PATHNAME flag).\n\nCreation of Regular Expression \nFor compiling or creating the regular expression regcomp() function is used. It takes three arguments: \nSyntax: \n \n\nregcomp(&regex, expression, flag)\nwhere, \n \n\nregex is a pointer to a memory location where expression is matched and stored.\nexpression is a string type\nflag to specify the type of compilation\nReturn Value: This returns the value as shown below: \n \n\n0: when successful compilation is done.\nError_code: When there is unsuccessful compilation of the expression.\nBelow is the illustration of the regcomp() function:\n// C program for illustration of regcomp()\n#include &lt;regex.h>\n#include &lt;stdio.h>\n \n// Driver Code\nint main()\n{\n \n // Variable to create regex\n regex_t reegex;\n \n // Variable to store the return\n // value after creation of regex\n int value;\n \n // Function call to create regex\n value = regcomp( &reegex, "[:word:]", 0);\n \n // If compilation is successful\n if (value == 0) {\n  printf("RegEx compiled successfully.");\n }\n \n // Else for Compilation error\n else {\n  printf("Compilation error.");\n }\n return 0;\n}\nOutput\nRegEx compiled successfully.\n\nMatching of Pattern using Regular Expression \nThe regexec() function is used to match a string against a pattern. It takes in five arguments: \n \n\nA precompiled pattern\nA string in which the pattern needs to be searched for.\nInformation regarding the location of matches.\nFlags to specify a change in the matching behavior.\nSyntax: \n \n\nregexec(&regex, expression, 0, NULL, 0);\nwhere, regex = precompiled pattern, \nexpression = pattern to be match in regex, \nNULL = Information regarding location of the matches. \nflag = to specify the change in matching behaviour\nReturn Value: This returns the value as shown below: \n \n\n0: If there is a match.\nREG_NOMATCH: If there is no match.\nBelow is the illustration of the regexec() function:\n \n\n\n\n\n// C program to illustrate the regexec() function\n#include &lt;regex.h>\n#include &lt;stdio.h>\n \n// Function to print the result\nvoid print_result(int value)\n{\n \n // If pattern found\n if (value == 0) {\n  printf("Pattern found.\n");\n }\n \n // If pattern not found\n else if (value == REG_NOMATCH) {\n  printf("Pattern not found.\n");\n }\n \n // If error occurred during Pattern\n // matching\n else {\n  printf("An error occurred.\n");\n }\n}\n \n// Driver Code\nint main()\n{\n \n // Variable to store initial regex()\n regex_t reegex;\n \n // Variable for return type\n int value;\n int value2;\n \n // Creation of regEx\n value = regcomp( &reegex, "Welcome to GfG", 0);\n \n // Comparing pattern "GeeksforGeeks" with\n // string in reg\n value = regexec( &reegex, "GeeksforGeeks",\n     0, NULL, 0);\n \n // Creation of regEx\n value2 = regcomp( &reegex, "GeeksforGeeks", 0);\n \n // Comparing pattern "Geeks"\n // with string in reg\n value2 = regexec( &reegex, "GeeksforGeeks",\n      0, NULL, 0);\n \n // Print the results\n print_result(value);\n print_result(value2);\n return 0;\n}\nOutput\nPattern not found.\nPattern found.\n\n',
'<h2>Split string with delimiters in C</h2>\nThe strtok() function split a string (and specify the delimiter to use).\nNote that strtok() will modify the string passed into it.\nExample (note it does not handle consecutive delimiters, "JAN,,,FEB,MAR" for example):\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <assert.h>\n\nchar** str_split(char* a_str, const char a_delim)\n{\n char** result = 0;\n size_t count  = 0;\n char* tmp  = a_str;\n char* last_comma = 0;\n char delim[2];\n delim[0] = a_delim;\n delim[1] = 0;\n /* Count how many elements will be extracted.\n*/\n while (*tmp)\n {\n  if (a_delim == *tmp)\n  {\n   count++;\n   last_comma = tmp;\n  }\n  tmp++;\n }\n /* Add space for trailing token.\n*/\n count += last_comma < (a_str + strlen(a_str) - 1);\n /* Add space for terminating null string so caller\n    knows where the list of returned strings ends.\n*/\n count++;\n result = malloc(sizeof(char*) * count);\n if (result)\n {\n  size_t idx  = 0;\n  char* token = strtok(a_str, delim);\n  while (token)\n  {\n   assert(idx < count);\n   *(result + idx++) = strdup(token);\n   token = strtok(0, delim);\n  }\n  assert(idx == count - 1);\n  *(result + idx) = 0;\n }\n return result;\n}\nint main()\n{\n char months[] = "JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEP,OCT,NOV,DEC";\n char** tokens;\n printf("months=[%s]\n\n", months);\n tokens = str_split(months, \',\');\n if (tokens)\n {\n  int i;\n  for (i = 0; *(tokens + i); i++)\n  {\n   printf("month=[%s]\n", *(tokens + i));\n   free(*(tokens + i));\n  }\n  printf("\n");\n  free(tokens);\n }\n return 0;\n}\nOutput:\n$ ./main.exe\nmonths=[JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEP,OCT,NOV,DEC]\n',
