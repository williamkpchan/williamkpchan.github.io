<h3>HTML 5 use id attribute instead of name for anchors</h3>
<pre>
Right:
&lt;a href="#test1" id="back"&gt; Test&lt;/a&gt; 

&lt;div id="test1" onclick="window.location.hash='back'; "&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
asklhfd
&lt;/div&gt; 

Note: use div tag, had tried the b tags not work
</pre>
==========
<h3>a href to jump to target with few lines spaces on top</h3>
<pre>
never use br with id or space separator. use:
&lt;p id="test2" style="margin-top:  -100px;"&gt;  as anchor
or any other html tags
</pre>

<h3>Attach a click event to the document. </h3>

<pre>
When the user clicks anywhere in the document, output "Hello World" in a 
&lt;p&gt;  element with id="demo":

document.addEventListener("click", function(){
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";
});

document.addEventListener("keydown", keyDownTextField, false);

function keyDownTextField(e) {
var keyCode = e.keyCode;
  if(keyCode==13) {
  alert("You hit the enter key.");
  } else {
  alert("Oh no you didn't.");
  }
}

</pre>
==========

<h3>document.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)</h3>
<pre>useCapture: Optional.
A Boolean value that specifies whether the event should be executed in the capturing or in the bubbling phase. 

Possible values:
true - The event handler is executed in the capturing phase
false- Default. The event handler is executed in the bubbling phase

<h3>Unicode</h3>
<pre>
Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
UCS-2 uses two bytes (16 bits) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points, the so-called Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). 
With 1,114,112 code points on 17 planes being possible, and with over 137,000 code points defined so far, many Unicode characters are beyond the reach of UCS-2. 
Therefore, UCS-2 is obsolete, though still widely used in software. 

UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same 16-bit encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. 
As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800–U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is a valid UTF-16 text.

Normally a Unicode code point is referred to by writing "U+" followed by its hexadecimal number. 
For code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), four digits are used (e.g., U+0058 for the character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X); 

for code points outside the BMP, five or six digits are used, as required (e.g., U+E0001 for the character LANGUAGE TAG and U+10FFFD for the character PRIVATE USE CHARACTER-10FFFD).

conversion:
<pre>change 'U+' to '&#x'</pre>
U+5DE8 =>  &#x264C
U+8AC7 => &#x8AC7
