<h2>HTML 5 use id attribute instead of name for anchors</h2>

Right:
&lt;a href="#test1" id="back"&gt; Test&lt;/a&gt; 

&lt;div id="test1" onclick="window.location.hash='back'; "&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
asklhfd
&lt;/div&gt; 

Note: use div tag, had tried the b tags not work

==========
<h2>a href to jump to target with few lines spaces on top</h2>

never use br with id or space separator. use:
&lt;p id="test2" style="margin-top:  -100px;"&gt;  as anchor
or any other html tags

<h2>Attach a click event to the document. </h2>


When the user clicks anywhere in the document, output "Hello World" in a 
&lt;p&gt;  element with id="demo":

document.addEventListener("click", function(){
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";
});

document.addEventListener("keydown", keyDownTextField, false);

function keyDownTextField(e) {

  } else {
  alert("Oh no you didn't.");
  }

<h2>document.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)</h2>
useCapture: Optional.
A Boolean value that specifies whether the event should be executed in the capturing or in the bubbling phase. 

Possible values:
true - The event handler is executed in the capturing phase
false- Default. The event handler is executed in the bubbling phase

&lt;audio src="http://ws.stream.qqmusic.qq.com/C100003OGUXl1Dcdny.m4a?fromtag=46" controls autoplay&gt; 黄金竖琴&lt;/audio&gt; 
the title 黄金竖琴 is useless, just help to know the music name
to hide the control, just remove the word "controls"

<h2>Unicode</h2>

Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
UCS-2 uses two bytes (16 bits) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points, the so-called Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). 
With 1,114,112 code points on 17 planes being possible, and with over 137,000 code points defined so far, many Unicode characters are beyond the reach of UCS-2. 
Therefore, UCS-2 is obsolete, though still widely used in software. 

UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same 16-bit encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. 
As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800–U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is a valid UTF-16 text.

Normally a Unicode code point is referred to by writing "U+" followed by its hexadecimal number. 
For code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), four digits are used (e.g., U+0058 for the character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X); 

for code points outside the BMP, five or six digits are used, as required (e.g., U+E0001 for the character LANGUAGE TAG and U+10FFFD for the character PRIVATE USE CHARACTER-10FFFD).

conversion:
change 'U+' to '&#x'
U+5DE8 =>  &#x264C
U+8AC7 => &#x8AC7

<h2>Event bubbling and capturing</h2>
Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. 

The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event.

With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.

With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.

Capturing is also called "trickling", which helps remember the propagation order:

trickle down, bubble up

Back in the old days, Netscape advocated event capturing, while Microsoft promoted event bubbling. 
Both are part of the W3C Document Object Model Events standard (2000).

We can use the addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture) to register event handlers for in either bubbling (default) or capturing mode. 
To use the capturing model pass the third argument as true.

<h2>Preload, prefetch</h2>
<a href="https://3perf.com/blog/link-rels/" class="whitebut ">Preload, prefetch and other link tags</a>
There’re multiple ways to improve web performance. 
One of those ways is to preload content you’ll need later in advance. Prefetch a CSS file, prerender a full page, or resolve a domain ahead of time – and you won’t have to wait for it when it’s actually needed!
There’re five link rel tags that instruct the browser to preload something:
link rel="prefetch"
link rel="preload"
link rel="preconnect"
link rel="dns-prefetch"
link rel="prerender"

dns-prefetch	preemptively perform DNS resolution for the target resource's origin
preconnect	preemptively connect to the target resource's origin.
prefetch	preemptively fetch and cache the target resource as it is likely to be required for a follow-up navigation

preload	preemptively fetch and cache the target resource for current navigation according to the destination given by the "as" attribute (and the priority associated with that destination).

prerender	pre-render (load) the specified webpage in the background. 
So, if the user navigates to this page, it speeds up the page load (because the page is already loaded). 
Warning! This waste the user's bandwidth! Only use prerender if it is absolutely sure that the webpage is required at some point in the user journey

Using a CSS background image</a><br> <a href="#inkscapetopic-9" target="_self">Comparison</a><br> <a href="#inkscapetopic-10" target="_self">Conclusion</a><br></div></center>

Use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and embed fonts using <a href="https://vecta.io/nano">Nano</a>.

If you are embedding an SVG onto your website in this day and age, chances are, you have a lot more factors to consider, in addition to browser compatibility. 
Before we do a comparison, let's have a look at what factors we are considering, when making a decision:
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-2">Design considerations</h3>
<h4>Alt and title attribute availability</h4>
When we embed an image onto HTML, it's always good to have <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> attributes, for better accessibility. 
An <code>alt</code> attribute allows a user to view the image description, even when it fails to render on a device, in addition to providing context for search engines. 
A <code>title</code> attribute allows hovering over the image to obtain more information. 
Ideally, whatever way you choose to embed an SVG, you should have <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> attributes.
<h4>Browser caching</h4>
We all know page speed will be a ranking factor on search engines, especially on mobile sites. 
It pays to enable browser caching for all static assets including SVG images. 
Ideally the embedding method will allow easy browser caching and <a href="https://www.alainschlesser.com/bust-cache-content-hash/">cache busting</a>.
<h4>GZip Compression</h4>
Unlike PNG and JPEG formats (practically, already compressed), SVG images are very well suited for compression. 
According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/minimize.html">World Wide Web Consortium</a>, SVG offers anything between <strong>75% - 85%</strong> compression ratio, reducing a <strong>16KB</strong> file to only <strong>4KB</strong>, resulting in considerable bandwidth and speed savings.
<h4>Interactivity</h4>
Because of <a href="https://blog.guya.net/2014/02/17/svg-for-fun-and-phishing/">security reasons</a>, some SVG embedding methods will block access to external resources including CSS, fonts and javascript. 
Especially when we have multiple images, ideally our embedding method should be able to refer to a single CSS, font or javascript file (to save resources) and be able to manipulate our embedded SVG.
<h4>Search engine indexing</h4>
Google has <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-now-indexes-crawls-svg-files-49695">publicly stated</a> that it will index and crawl SVG files. 
Therefore, it makes sense for better SEO (Search Engine Optimization), that the embedding method we adopt would allow search engines to list our images on image search.
<h4>Streamlined work flow</h4>
The embedding method we choose should result in an easy and streamlined workflow, that do not require extra work with maintaining complicated CSS and embedding methods.
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-3">1. Using an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag</h3>
The best and the simplest way to embed SVG into HTML is to use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. 
It has a syntax that is similar to how we embed other image formats like PNG, JPEG and GIF:

<code>&lt;img src="image.svg" /&gt;
</code>
<table class="Left.cls First.cls"><tbody><tr><td>Browser support</td><td>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is now supported across all major browsers that support SVG (IE9+).</td></tr><tr><td>Alt and title attributes</td><td>Both available.</td></tr><tr><td>Browser caching</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>GZip compression</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>Interactivity</td><td>None. 
If interactivity is required, use <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag.</td></tr><tr><td>Search engine indexing</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>Workflow</td><td>Streamlined, as with other image formats.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Losing fonts</h4>
If you use an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with web fonts, the fonts will fail to render and resort to using only system fonts.

This is mainly because images with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags are not allowed to refer to external resources including CSS, fonts and scripts, for <a href="https://blog.guya.net/2014/02/17/svg-for-fun-and-phishing/">security reasons</a>.

You can manually embed fonts into your SVG to resolve this, but most times, will result in large SVG size, and therefore negating the advantages SVG has, over other image formats.

The exception being, to use <a href="https://vecta.io">vecta.io</a> or <a href="https://vecta.io/nano">vecta.io/nano</a> to produce an SVG that is very low in size, self contained without losing any fonts, and reduced complexity in your workflow. 
They not only minify the SVG but also minify the fonts as well, resulting in a very small SVG (22% smaller than competition), comparable to PNG @1X resolution, saving you a ton of bandwidth and makes your site load faster.

Embedding fonts is just a matter of drag and drop, and results in impressive quality without sacrificing file sizes.

<a href="/blog/making-svg-easier-to-use/">Making SVG easier to use (Why we build Nano)</a>
<a href="/blog/comparing-svg-and-png-file-sizes/">Comparing SVG and PNG file sizes</a>
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-4">2. Using an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag</h3>
If you require interactivity, this is your best option:

<code>&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" data="image.svg"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code>
<table class="Left.cls First.cls"><tbody><tr><td>Browser support</td><td>The <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is supported across all major browsers that support SVG (IE9+).</td></tr><tr><td>Alt and title attributes</td><td>None.</td></tr><tr><td>Browser caching</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>GZip Compression</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>Interactivity</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>Search engine indexing</td><td>None. 
Workaround available, but with compromises.</td></tr><tr><td>Workflow</td><td>Medium. 
Requires extra work in referring to external CSS and font files.</td></tr></tbody></table>
Technically, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tags can be used on many elements, including SVG files, and therefore not recognized as image elements, thus not available on image search. 
The workaround is to use an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag as fallback:

<code>&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" data="image.svg"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Your fall back here --&gt;
    &lt;img src="image.svg" /&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
</code>
<h4>Double loading</h4>
The only problem is double loading, that is the browser will load the image on the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag, and another image on the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, even though only one of them is required, while the other is hidden. 
If you cache your images, and mark these files as cacheable on your server, at least, the browser will load these images from the cache, but still, there is no stopping the double loading.
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-5">3. Using inline SVG in HTML5</h3>
Essentially you are embedding all your SVG codes inside your HTML:

<code>&lt;body&gt; 
   &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
       &lt;text x="10" y="50" font-size="30"&gt;My SVG&lt;/text&gt;
   &lt;/svg&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt;
</code>
<table class="Left.cls First.cls"><tbody><tr><td>Browser support</td><td>Supported across all major browsers that support SVG (IE9+).</td></tr><tr><td>Alt and title attributes</td><td>None.</td></tr><tr><td>Browser caching</td><td>None.</td></tr><tr><td>GZip compression</td><td>None.</td></tr><tr><td>Interactivity</td><td>Available.</td></tr><tr><td>Search engine indexing</td><td>None.</td></tr><tr><td>Workflow</td><td>Convoluted.</td></tr></tbody></table>
Because inline SVG is embedded into HTML, there is no necessity for another network request to obtain the SVG file, and therefore inline SVG will load the fastest.

Be aware that you will still get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">FOUC (Flash of unstyled content)</a> because chances are, your inline SVG will still refer to an external font. 
To solve FOUC, you will require embedded fonts as listed in <a href="#1-Using-an-lt-img-gt-tag">Using an &lt;img&gt; tag</a>.

Since the SVG is essentially the DOM, you can easily use external CSS, fonts and scripts. 
Multiple SVG can be inlined that refers to a single CSS or font files, therefore saving bandwidth and resources.

In addition, you get the ability to select, highlight and copy text in your SVG, plus the ability for search engines to index these text (Our opinion is that one should rely on HTML for SEO, and leave SVG separated, so we can index text using HTML and index images using SVG).

Workflow is way more complicated since SVG is mixed with HTML, and requires a lot more work maintaining dependencies.
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-6">4. Using an <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag</h3>
Listed here for completeness, but do NOT use <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag. 
It is not part of HTML specifications but widely supported on all browsers mainly used to implement Flash plugins.

<code>&lt;embed type="image/svg+xml" src="image.svg" /&gt;
</code>

<h3 id="inkscapetopic-7">5. Using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag</h3>
Do NOT use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> where you can use an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag instead. 
Iframes are difficult to maintain, does not get indexed by search engines and bad for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

<code>&lt;iframe src="image.svg"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code>
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-8">6. Using a CSS background image</h3>
This is equivalent to using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, and subjected to the same advantages and disadvantages.

<code>#id {
  background-image: url(image.svg);
}
</code>
<h3 id="inkscapetopic-9">Comparison</h3>
<table class="Left.cls First.cls"><thead><tr><th></th><th><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></th><th><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></th><th>Inline SVG</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Browser support</td><td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Alt and title attribute</td><td>Yes</td><td>None</td><td>Title only</td></tr><tr><td>Browser caching</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>GZip compression</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Interactivity</td><td>None</td><td>Yes</td><td>Very good</td></tr><tr><td>Search engine indexing</td><td>Yes</td><td>Through fallback</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Workflow</td><td>Streamlined</td><td>Medium</td><td>Convoluted</td></tr><tr><td>Loading speed</td><td>Fast</td><td>Slower</td><td>Very fast</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="inkscapetopic-10">Conclusion</h3>
As can be seen from comparison, it is clear we are recommending <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag for most use cases. 
The only exception is if you need interactivity, where you require dynamic changes to your SVG based on user interactions.

We do not recommend inline SVG for most cases, with the only exception being preloading pages. 
Preloading pages are contents shown when your application has yet to completely load, and since inline SVG shows almost immediately, it can be used to show images or graphics while waiting for your application to load.

<h2>Using SVG </h2>
<h3>Why use SVG at all?</h3>

Small file sizes that compress well
Scales to any size without losing clarity (except very tiny)
Looks great on retina displays
Design control like interactivity and filters

<h3>Getting some SVG to work with</h3>
Design something in Adobe Illustrator. 
Here's a Kiwi bird standing on an oval.

<img class="lazy" src='https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kiwi.png'>
Notice the artboard is cropped up right against the edges of the design. 
Canvas matters in SVG just like it would in PNG or JPG.

You can save the file directly from Adobe Illustrator as an SVG file.

<img class="lazy" src='https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/save-as-svg.png'>
As you save it, you'll get another dialog for SVG Options. 
I honestly don't know much about all this. 
There is a whole spec for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile/">SVG Profiles</a>. 
I find SVG 1.1 works fine.

<img class="lazy" src='https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/svg-options.png'>
The interesting part here is that you can either press OK and save the file, or press &#8220;SVG Code&#8230;&#8221; and it will open TextEdit (on a Mac anyway) with the SVG code in it. 


<img class="lazy" src='https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/svg-code.png'>
Both can be useful.

<h3>Using SVG as an &lt;img></h3>
If I save the SVG to a file, I can use it directly in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.

<code>&lt;img src="kiwi.svg" alt="Kiwi standing on oval"&gt;</code>
In Illustrator, our artboard was 612px ✕ 502px.

<img class="lazy" src='https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/artboard.png'>
That's exactly how big the image will on the page, left to itself. 
You can change the size of it though just by selecting the <code>img</code> and changing its <code>width</code> or <code>height</code>, again like you could a PNG or JPG. 
Here's <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/evcBu">an example</a> of that:

<code></code><a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/lCEux">Check out this Pen!</a>
<h4>Browser support</h4>
Using it this way has its own set of specific <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-img">browser support</a>. 
Essentially: it works everywhere except IE 8 and down and Android 2.3 and down. 


If you'd like to use SVG, but also need to support these browsers that don't support using SVG in this way, you have options. 
I've covered different techniques in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/workshop-notes-webstock-13/">different</a> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/workshop-notes-from-incontrol-hawaii/">workshops</a> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/deseret-digital-workshop/">I've done</a>. 


One way is to test for support with Modernizr and swap out the <code>src</code> of the image:

<code class="language-javascript">if (!Modernizr.svg) {
  $(".logo img").attr("src", "images/logo.png");
}</code>
David Bushell has a really <a href="http://dbushell.com/2013/02/04/a-primer-to-front-end-svg-hacking/">simple alternative</a>, if you're OK with JavaScript in the markup:

<code>&lt;img src="image.svg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='image.png'"&gt;</code>
<a href="http://benhowdle.im/svgeezy/">SVGeezy</a> can also help. 
We'll cover more fallback techniques as this article progresses.

<h3>Using SVG as a background-image</h3>
Similarly easy to using SVG as an img, you can use it in CSS as a <code>background-image</code>.

<code>&lt;a href="/" class="logo"&gt;
  Kiwi Corp
&lt;/a&gt;</code>
<code class="language-css">.logo {
  display: block;
  text-indent: -9999px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 82px;
  background: url(kiwi.svg);
  background-size: 100px 82px;
}</code>
Notice we set the background-size to the size of the logo element. 
We have to do that otherwise we'll just see a bit of the upper left of our much larger original SVG image. 
These numbers are aspect-ratio aware of the original size. 
But you could use a <code>background-size</code> keywords like <code>contain</code> if you want to make sure the image will fit and can't know the parent image will be of the exact right size.

<h4>Browser support</h4>
Using SVG as background-image has its own special set of <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-css">browser support</a>, but it's essentially the same as using SVG as img. 
The only problem browsers are IE 8 and down and Android 2.3 and down.

Modernizr can help us here, and in a more efficient way than using img. 
If we replace the <code>background-image</code> with a supported format, only one HTTP request will be made instead of two. 
Modernizr adds a class name of &#8220;no-svg&#8221; to the html element if it doesn't support SVG, so we use that:

<code class="language-css">.main-header {
  background: url(logo.svg) no-repeat top left;
  background-size: contain;
}

.no-svg .main-header {
  background-image: url(logo.png);
}</code>
Another clever progressive enhancement flavored technique for using SVG as background-image is by using it in conjunction with multiple backgrounds. 
SVG and multiple backgrounds have very similar browser support, so if the browser supports multiple backgrounds, it supports SVG, and the declaration will work (and override any previous declaration).

<code class="language-css">body {
  background: url(fallback.png);
  background-image: url(image.svg), none;
}</code>
<h3>The problem with both &lt;img> and background-image&#8230;</h3>
Is that you don't get to control the innards of the SVG with CSS like you can with the following two ways. 
Read on!

<h3>Using &#8220;inline&#8221; SVG</h3>
Remember how you can grab the SVG code right from Illustrator while saving if you want? (You can also just open the SVG file in a text editor and grab that code.) You can drop that code right into an HTML document and the SVG image will show up just the same as if you put it in an img.

<code>&lt;body&gt;

   &lt;!-- paste in SVG code, image shows up!  --&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;</code>
This can be nice because the image comes over right in the document and doesn't need to make an additional HTTP request. 
In other words, it has the same advantages as using a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/">Data URI</a>. 
It has the same disadvantages too. 
A potentially &#8220;bloated&#8221; document, a big chunk of crap right in the document you're trying to author, and inability to cache.

If you're using a back end language that can go fetch the file and insert it, at least you can clean up the authoring experience. 
Like:

<code>&lt;?php echo file_get_contents("kiwi.svg"); ?&gt;</code>
A little PHP-specific thing here&#8230; it was demonstrated to me that <code>file_get_contents()</code> is the correct function here, not <code>include()</code> or <code>include_once()</code> as I have used before. 
Specifically because SVG sometimes is exported with <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</code> that as the opening line, which will cause the PHP parser to choke on it.

<h4>Optimize it first</h4>
Likely not a huge shocker, but the SVG that Adobe Illustrator gives you isn't particularly optimized. 
It has a DOCTYPE and generator notes and all that junk. 
SVG is already pretty small, but why not do all we can? Peter Collingridge has an online <a href="https://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser">SVG Optimiser</a> tool. 
Upload the old, download the new. 
In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVzW3XuOm7E&#038;feature=youtu.be">Kyle Foster's video</a>, he even takes it the extra mile and removes line breaks after this optimization. 


If you're even more hardcore, here is a <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">Node JS tool</a> for doing it yourself.

<h4>Now you can control with CSS!</h4>
See how the SVG looks a lot like HTML? That's because they are both essentially XML (named tags with angle brackets with stuff inside). 
In our design, we have two elements that make up the design, an <code>&lt;ellipse&gt;</code> and an <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>. 
We can jump into the code and give them class names, just like any other HTML element can have.

<code>&lt;svg ...&gt;
  &lt;ellipse class="ground" .../&gt;
  &lt;path class="kiwi" .../&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code>
Now in any CSS on this page we can control those individual elements with special SVG CSS. 
This doesn't have to be CSS embedded in the SVG itself, it can be anywhere, even in our global stylesheet <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>ed up. 
Note that SVG elements have a special set of CSS properties that work on them. 
For instance, it's not <code>background-color</code>, it's <code>fill</code>. 
You can use normal stuff like :hover though.

<code class="language-css">.kiwi {
  fill: #94d31b; 
}
.kiwi:hover {
  fill: #ace63c; 
}</code>
Even cooler, SVG has all these fancy filters. 
For instance blurring. 
Chuck a filter in your <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>:

<code>&lt;svg ...&gt;
  ...
  &lt;filter id="pictureFilter" &gt;
    &lt;feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="5" /&gt;
  &lt;/filter&gt; 
&lt;/svg&gt;</code>
Then you can apply that in your CSS as needed:

<code class="language-css">.ground:hover {
  filter: url(#pictureFilter);
}</code>
Here's <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/evcBu">an example</a> of all that:

<a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/graphics/hands-on-css3/hands-on_svg-filter-effects.htm">SVG filter effects playground</a> (from Microsoft)

<h4>Browser support</h4>
Inline SVG has it's own <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-html5">set of browser support</a>, but again, it's essentially only an issue in IE 8 and down and Android 2.3 and down<sup>1</sup>. 


One way to handle fallbacks for this type of SVG is:

<code>&lt;svg&gt; ... 
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class="fallback"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
Then use Modernizr again:

<code class="language-css">.fallback { 
  display: none;
  /* Make sure it's the same size as the SVG takes up */
}
.no-svg .fallback { 
  background-image: url(logo.png); 
}</code>
<h3>Using SVG as an &lt;object></h3>
If &#8220;inline&#8221; SVG just isn't your jam (remember it does have some legit drawbacks like being hard to cache), you can link to an SVG file and retain the ability to affect its parts with CSS by using <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>.

<code>&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" data="kiwi.svg" class="logo"&gt;
  Kiwi Logo &lt;!-- fallback image in CSS --&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</code>
For the fallback, Modernizr detection will work fine here:

<code class="language-css">.no-svg .logo {
  width: 200px;
  height: 164px;
  background-image: url(kiwi.png);
}</code>
This will work great with caching and actually has <em>deeper</em> support than using it any other way. 
But, if you want the CSS stuff to work, you can't use an external stylesheet or <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> on the document, you need to use a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element inside the SVG file itself.

<code>&lt;svg ...&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    /* SVG specific fancy CSS styling here */
  &lt;/style&gt;
  ...
&lt;/svg&gt;</code>
<h4>External stylesheets for &lt;object> SVG</h4>
SVG has a way to declare an external stylesheet, which can be nice for authoring and caching and whatnot. 
This only works with <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> embedding of SVG files as far as I've tested. 
You'll need to put this in the SVG file above the opening <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag. 


<code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="svg.css" ?&gt;</code>
If you put that in your HTML, the page will barf and not even try to render. 
If you link up an SVG file that has that in it as an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>background-image</code>, it won't barf, but it won't work (the SVG will still render though). 


<h3>Data URL's for SVG</h3>
Another way to use SVG's is to convert them into Data URL's. 
Data URL's might not save you actual file size, but can be more efficient because the data is right there. 
It doesn't require an additional network request. 


Mobilefish.com has <a href="http://www.mobilefish.com/services/base64/base64.php">an online conversion tool</a> for that base64ing them, but <a href="https://css-tricks.com/probably-dont-base64-svg/">I generally don't think that's a good idea</a> for SVG. 
Simply paste in the contents of your SVG file and fill out the form and it will display the results in a textarea for you to copy. 
Remember to remove line breaks in the data it gives you back. 
It looks like pure gibberish:

<img class="lazy" src='https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/base64-data.png'>
You can use that anywhere we've talked about so far (except inline <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> because that just doesn't make sense) Just put the gibberish where it says [data] in these examples.

<a href="https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/">This converter</a> is my fav, as it leaves the SVG as mostly readable text:

<iframe src="https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/" style="width: 100%; height: 900px;"></iframe>

<h4>As &lt;img></h4>
<code>&lt;img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,[data]"&gt;</code>
<h4>As CSS</h4>
<code class="language-css">.logo {
  background: url("data:image/svg+xml;base64,[data]");
}</code>
Relevant note here: regular CSS doesn't care if you put quotes around the data URI, but Sass does, so I've quoted it above (Thx Oziel Perez).

<h4>As &lt;object></h4>
<code>&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" data="data:image/svg+xml;base64,[data]"&gt;
  fallback
&lt;/object&gt;</code>
And yep, if you have an embedded <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> in your SVG before you base64 it, <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/ioCjk">it will work</a> if you use it as an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> still!

<h4>Format for Data URI</h4>
All the examples above have base64 as the encoding, but data URI's do not have to be base64. 
In fact in the case of SVG, it's probably <a href="https://css-tricks.com/probably-dont-base64-svg/">better NOT to use base64</a>. 
Primarily because the native format of SVG is much more repetitive than base64 ends up, it gzips better. 


<code>&lt;!-- base64 --&gt;
data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL...

&lt;!-- UTF-8, not encoded --&gt;
data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,&lt;svg ...&gt; ... 
&lt;/svg&gt;

&lt;!-- UTF-8, optimized encoding for compatibility --&gt;
data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,%3Csvg xmlns='http://...'

&lt;!-- Fully URL encoded ASCII --&gt;
data:image/svg+xml;charset=US-ASCII,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A//...</code>
