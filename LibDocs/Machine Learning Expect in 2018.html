<div id="toc"><ul></ul></div>

<br>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>2017 has been a really exciting year for a data science professional. This is pretty evident from the new technologies that have been emerging day-by-day such as Face-ID which has revolutionized the way we secure information in our mobile phones. Self-driving cars had been a myth, but now they are very much a reality, the adoption of which can be seen by governments throughout the world.</p>
<p>Data science is a field wherein ground-breaking research is happening at a much faster pace, in comparison to any other emergent technologies ever before. The time between contemplating a research idea and actually implementing it has come down significantly. . This is also fueled by the immense amount of resources freely available to everyone &#8211; which essentially enables even a normal person to contribute to research in their own way. For example, GitHub (a collaborative platform for software development) is now paving the way for research ideas to be shared in an implementation format. As Andrew Ng said</p>
<blockquote><p>Data is the new Oil<br />
AI is the new Electricity</p></blockquote>
<p>Personalization and Automation is the talk of the day and more and more industries such as Financial Services, Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals and Automotive are adapting to the developments being brought upon by better Machine learning / Deep Learning models. This article specially focuses on the defining moments of Data Science in 2017. We have kept a few criterion in mind when we curated the list, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a data science professional, does the event affect you in any way?</li>
<li>Does it influence your learning or your daily workflow?</li>
<li>Is it an innovative startup, product release or recent development?</li>
<li>Is it an industry collaboration which will impact the future of data science?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we have shared our predictions in Data Science industry for the year 2018, which we believe would be really something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>2017 probably saw its biggest announcement from Elon Musk who announced creation of a company called Neuralink that aims at building high bandwidth and safe Brain-Machine interfaces. It looks like Elon has finally decided to bring Matrix into reality where learning new skills for example flying a helicopter is just a matter of plugging a wire into your neocortex. All this may sound fiction and over exaggerated but Elon has been known to make things real, take Tesla and SpaceX for example.</p>
<p>If it all comes true, humans may soon have the technology to study and map the brain in its entirety. This has far reaching implications to vastly improving healthcare to augmenting human capacity. And Elon seems serious too. The company recently received a  $27 M funding and is looking to raise another $100M through its shares. For us mortal minds, open the link in the heading to understand how it all started and how the mission of Neuralink is grandeur enough to change the future of humanity if brought to reality.</p>

<p>You have seen errors while dealing with categorical variables to build machine learning models using library “sklearn”, at least in the initial days &#8220;ValueError: could not convert string to float&#8221;. This error occurs when dealing with categorical (string) variables. In “sklearn”, you are required to convert these categories in the numerical format. In order to do this conversion, we use several pre-processing methods like “label encoding”, “one hot encoding” and others. &#8220;CatBoost”, a recently open-sourced library, developed and contributed by Yandex does this for you automatically.</p>

<p>H &amp; R Block, a tax preparation company is partnering with IBM Watson, to develop internal systems to help its employees&#8217; to file customer’s taxes. The US tax code is 74,000 pages long which is difficult for any one person to know. IBM Watson will help tax professionals with prompts and questions to aid the tax interview process. At the end of this year’s tax process, this will also leave Watson with a massive library of tax data, which it can then analyze.</p>

<p>Shelf Engine is a startup developing robust models to help grocery stores enable their category managers to match orders of hundreds or thousands of products to demand. In the company’s <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5664d42ce4b041edc7625b53/t/588feaa2197aea6ab4068096/1485827289195/Case+Study.pdf">case study</a>, it explains how many managers often make orders based on their current waste numbers — a flawed method, because “that decision isn’t based on a cumulation of waste and deliveries.” Shelf Engine uses an order prediction engine and probability models that analyze historical order and sales data, gross margins, and shelf life information. The more a customer uses the system, the more accurate its recommendations become. The startup is backed by by Initialized Capital (Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is a general partner), with participation from Founder’s Co-op, Liquid 2 Ventures (Joe Montana is a general partner), and others.</p>

<p>Body labs, a computer vision startup has developed applications that takes any input, whether that’s 2D photos, 3D scans or actual body measurements and predicts full, 3D visual body shapes. The implications of this built-out technology are massive, spanning not only commercial opportunities in fashion and apparel, but fitness, gaming, health and manufacturing. This could actually solve the fitting issues with the customers especially in the ecommerce which is marred by huge return requests due to size issues. Body Labs was founded by Michael Black, William J. O&#8217;Farrell, Eric Rachlin, and Alex Weiss who were connected at Brown University and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.</p>

<p>Google acquired Kaggle, a competition platform for data scientists in March, 2017. Kaggle is known for hosting data science and machine learning competitions as well. Google is claimed to have acquired Kaggle in an attempt to enhance the AI and machine learning functionalities and to take advantage of the 600,000 data scientists at Kaggle&#8217;s community. With this acquisition, Kaggle has continued to provide services as before, but the product enhancements seen in Kaggle platform has increased multifold. For example, “kernels” which are online coding environments are a lot smoother and provide a lot more functionality than before &#8211; such as longer runtimes.</p>

<p>Baidu taught an AI agent to navigate 2D space using only natural language, the same basic feedback mechanism a human parent uses with an infant. This is a progress towards building AI that can be taught in the same way as humans. Next target for the Chinese giant is to teach a physical robot navigate in a 3D space which is more realistic. This application based on reinforcement learning has huge implications for the robotics industry.</p>

<p>Descartes Labs, a start-up in Mexico, uses satellite imagery and AI to predict food supplies and crisis-level food shortages months in advance. This leaves enough time to mount orderly humanitarian responses or optimize food supply networks. By processing these images and data via their advanced machine learning algorithm, Descartes Labs collect remarkably in-depth information such as being able to distinguish individual crop fields and determining the specific field’s crop by analyzing how the sun’s light is reflecting off its surface. After the type of crop has been established, the machine learning program then monitors the field’s production levels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Entrupy&#8221; is a start-up that uses computer vision algorithms to detect counterfeit products. They created a portable scanning device that instantly detects imitation designer bags by taking microscopic pictures that take into account details of the material, processing, workmanship, serial number, and wears/tear. It then employs the technique of deep learning to compare the images against a vast database that includes top luxury brands and if the bag is deemed authentic, users immediately get a Certificate of Authenticity.</p>

<p>Cardiogram, in partnership with University of California San Francisco, modified an Apple watch that can detect atrial fibrillation — the most common heart arrhythmia — with higher accuracy than previously validated methods. They achieved this feat using deep learning techniques. As soon as the disease is detected, the device could send you a notification: “We noticed an abnormality in your heartbeat. Want to chat with a cardiologist?” which can potentially decrease the time between the onset of the disease, its detection, and its care.</p>

<p>DeepMind researchers created what they&#8217;re calling &#8220;imagination-augmented agents,&#8221; or I2As, that have a neural network trained to extract any information from its environment that could be useful in making decisions later on. These agents can create, evaluate and follow through on plans. To construct and evaluate future plans, the I2As &#8220;imagine&#8221; actions and outcomes in sequence before deciding which plan to execute. They can also choose how they want to imagine, options for which include trying out different possible actions separately or chaining actions together in a sequence.</p>

It does most of the heavy lifting required to complete a data science lifecycle on its own. This is a very powerful idea; while we previously have had to worry about tuning parameters and hyperparameters, automated machine learning systems can learn the best way to tune these for optimal outcomes by a number of different possible methods.<br />

<h2>What more can we expect in 2018?</h2>
<p>There is so much happening in the industry that its difficult to keep up with the current trends. And it will continue to grow, as soon as the cutting-edge research is transformed into use for the ordinary man. To give an example, you can see the impact that deep learning research has done to computer vision, where we see applications like Face-ID, self-driving car just around the corner. In the future, you will certainly see a boom in the applications that can be driven by deep learning techniques.<a href="https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-12.56.20-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-40266 aligncenter" src="https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-12.56.20-AM.png" alt="" width="574" height="367" srcset="https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-12.56.20-AM.png 1196w, https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-12.56.20-AM-300x192.png 300w, https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-12.56.20-AM-768x492.png 768w, https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-12.56.20-AM-850x544.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a></p>
<p>A few things that I am particularly looking forward to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Will Hinton&#8217;s Capsule Networks be the next big deal in the deep learning scene?</li>
<li>Research in data science will become more and more <a href="https://ai-on.org/">community driven</a></li>
<li>Tools will become simpler to use, with most of the manual details being automated.</li>
<li>It will become evident to put ethical rules and regulations in place for artificial agents &#8211; especially in transportation</li>
<li>Hardware will be cheaper and more efficient &#8211; with a tendency to go to AI enabled chips</li>
<li>Learning-wise the focus will shift to self-learning, as availability of open courses increase</li>
<li>You can see automated machine learning will become valuable</li>
<li>GANs will become more functional and industry will start using GAN</li>
<li>Deep Reinforcement Learning is the most general purpose of all learning techniques, so it can be used in the most business applications.</li>
<li>You can expect a development towards making a black box model explainable</li>
<li>There would be lots of data sources like IoT devices, CCTV, Social Media and others and these information will help us to build better and automated systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Andrej Karpathy, an eminent personality in data science industry <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="anon">Neural networks are not just another classifier, they represent the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we write software. They are Software 2.0. Software 2.0 is not going to replace the software we know now, but it is going to take over increasingly large portions of what software is responsible for today.</span></p></blockquote>
