I am from Taiwan, and have never lived in mainland China.

Despite having answered similar questions on Quora with a different take, I would like to offer another point here.

It cannot be more natural and healthy to see what you questioned, if everyone behaves in a logical and upright manner, because it is the English based forum, Quora, with predominantly Western audience, that we are talking about.

To do the opposite would be called “Preaching to the Choir”, a senseless, boring, and somewhat cowardly and slavish act.

If I want to defend the US and castigate China, and if I am a logical and upstanding person, I would find a Chinese forum* with mostly Chinese audience to do this, not on Quora for crying out loud!

Actually, I do exactly that in Chinese on Chinese YouTube videos from time to time! That’s where it counts, not here!

Wouldn’t you find it boring otherwise, to self-congratulate, self-glorify within a silo of people who parrot each other to get high? What is the fun in that? Isn’t that even dangerous?

Shouldn’t you be happy and thankful to have people who are bold and honest enough to poke your bubble full of holes, so that you get some badly needed mental stimulation? Isn’t this the most natural, most healthy way things should be? Or you really prefer to hear your own voice regurgitated 100 times by your clones? Or you prefer the North Korean Way?

* I am not interested in distracting the subject into how easy or how hard it is to do this. That would be off the mark to my point here. In any case, I learned English, which is not my native tongue, in order to post here on Quora, so you can learn Chinese to play my counterpart as a first step.
