<h2>EFI System Partition (ESP)</h2>

EFI System Partition contains essential elements such as boot loader, system drivers, kernel images etc. 
required to run your computer. Disturbing this partition may make your computer unusable.

The easiest way is to use Disk Manager to remove the drive letter

Choose "Start windows normally" option and turn the UPS off immediately.
Then turn on the PC again, let it load.
After that you will be prompted with two options in the boot screen (again), select the first option - "Launch Start-up Repair(recommended)"

After 5 min, It will ask you to "restore defaults", select "Cancel" option.

Let it continue...
Wait for About 15-20 Minutes:
Now this is where the tricky part comes:

After 20 min, an error report screen will pop-up, asking to send information or not.

Ignore it, click on "View Problem Details" arrow, scroll down to the end of the report, then click a link stating X:\windows\ something...something (the link starts with an"X")

Another Window will pop-up, and will look like a notepad (it is a notepad)
Click File on the Menu-Bar, then select Open, and another window will pop-up (that's just too many windows!)
Navigate to C: drive (or whatever drive on which windows is installed), click Windows, then System32, after that click on the arrow beside the "File Type" option and select "all files"

Then search for a file named "sethc"(this is the shortcut to stickey keys), rename it to something else (Eg:abc)
Search for cmd, make its copy and rename the copy as "sethc"
--------------------------------------ITS DONE!!!---------------------------------------------
(Almost)

Close everything, restart the PC, go to the log-in screen, press shift 5 times, until a cmd (command prompt) pops-up.

Type in "net user administrator /active:yes", and this will activate the default administrator account of the PC.
Change/delete/manage/reset passwords from there.
Or you can directly change passwords from cmd, type "net user (admin/any admin account's name) and then after a space put an asterix.
---------------------------------------HACKED------------------------------------------------


Step 4The End:
I know that many of you may know this vulnerability in Windows 7, I just wanted that a tutorial like this should be in Null Byte.

Unfortunately, this vulnerability been overcame in Windows 8 :(

透過命令來修改「工作排程器」的內容，
基本上是要靠 Windows 提供的「schtasks」這個指令（MSDN）；
而如果是要把「Reboot」這項工作給停用的話，命令的寫法則可以寫成下面的樣子：

schtasks /change /disable /TN \Microsoft\Windows\UpdateOrchestrator\Reboot
不過這邊要注意的是，要執行這個指令是需要系統管理員的身分的。

而之後，只要把上面的指令，存成一個 bat 檔案，
之後每次安裝完 Windows Update 後，
再去用系統管理員權限去執行這個批次檔，
理論上就可以避免電腦在安裝 Windows Update 後，還會自動從休眠狀態中被喚醒一次了。

<h2>Disable Windows 10 Search Indexing</h2>
<strong>To disable Search Indexing in Windows 10</strong>, do the following.

Press <kbd class="win">Win</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> shortcut keys on the keyboard to open the Power user menu. 
Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start menu. 
In the menu, select the item <em>Computer Management</em>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Win-X-computer-management.png">


The Computer Management utility will be opened. 
On the left, expand the tree view to Services and Applications\Services.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Computer-management-Services.png">


On the right, you will see the list of installed services. 
Find the service named "Windows Search". 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Windows-Search-Service-in-the-list.png">


Double-click the Windows Search row to open the service properties dialog. 
If the service has the status "Running", click on the Stop button, and wait until its status shows as Stopped.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Service-properties-stop-button.png">


Now, change the startup type from <em>Automatic (Delayed Start)</em> to <em>Disabled</em> using the drop down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disable-Search-Indexing-Windows-10.png">


Click Apply and OK and you are done.

If you prefer the command prompt method described in the article <a href="https://winaero.com/blog/disable-service-windows-10/">How to Disable A Service in Windows 10</a>, do the following.
<h2>Disable Search Indexing in Windows 10 using Command Prompt</h2>

The second command will disable it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disable-Search-Indexing-Windows-10-cmd.png">


Note: It is very important to add a space after "=" and not before it.

That's it!
<h2>Manage Windows 10 Search Indexing</h2>
You have  three options when it comes to Windows Search Indexing:
<li>Remove folders from indexation to reduce the scan time</li>
<li>Disable content indexation</li>
<li>Disable Windows Search indexing completely</li>

<h3>Remove folders from indexation</h3>
<strong>Tip</strong>: It is a good idea to limit indexation to folders that you want Windows Search to index. 
<h4>Indexing Options</h4>
control panel-> Indexing Options
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/indexing-options.png">

You manage the indexing locations in the Indexing Options. 
To load the configuration, tap on the Windows-key, type indexing options, and select the result of the same name.

The Indexing Options window lists all folders that are included or excluded from indexation. 
It furthermore highlights the number of items that are in the index currently, and the status of indexing.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/windows-search-indexing-options.png">

Select Modify at the bottom to manage the indexing locations. 
This opens a dual-pane window that lists all available locations in the top pane, and all folders selected for indexation at the bottom.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Make sure you click on the "show all locations" button to reveal locations that may not be shown by default.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/indexed-locations.png">

You add new locations by checking boxes in front of items in the top pane, and remove existing ones by removing the checkmarks from the boxes. 
Since you may not want to navigate the top folder structure to locate all indexed locations, you may click on a location in the lower pane to jump straight to it. 
This allows you to remove it with just two clicks.

When you remove a location from Windows Search indexing, Windows Search won't scan it anymore when it runs scans for changes in those locations.

You may also exclude subfolders from indexation. 
This is useful if you want some locations of a folder to be indexed but not others. 
Using exclude options may further help reduce the load of indexation when Windows Search indexing runs.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/advanced-indexing-options.png">

Check the Advanced options once you are done. 
Make sure that the options "index encrypted files" and "treat similar words with diacritics as different words" are not selected.

You may delete and recreate the index on the page as well, and change the location of the index. 
The latter may be useful if the computer's main drive is slower than another drive connected to the device.

<h3>Disable content indexation</h3>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/drive-content-indexation.png">

Another thing that you may want to check is whether Windows Search is allowed to index file content and not only file properties on select drives. 
It takes more time obviously to scan the content of files as well, and if you don't need that, you may want to make sure that this is not done on the Windows machine in question.

You need to repeat the following steps for any drive of the Windows 10 PC:

<li>Open File Explorer.</li>
<li>Right-click on the drive, e.g. 
Local Disk (c:), and select properties from the context menu.</li>
<li>Go to the General tab if it does not open automatically.</li>
<li>Remove the checkmark from "Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed in addition to file properties".</li>
<li>Confirm the Attribute changes by selecting "apply changes to drive, subfolders and files, and click ok.</li>


The process may take a while before it completes. 
It can run for minutes and even longer than that depending on the size of the drive.

You may get an access denied error. 
I suggest you select "ignore all" when that happens to tell Windows that it should ignore any future access denied error automatically.

<h3>Disable Windows Search Indexing completely</h3>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stop-windows-search.png">

The final option that you have is to disable Windows Search indexing completely. 
This prevents any indexation processes and should improve the situation on all devices that are affected by high load or performance issues that are caused by Windows Search indexing.

<li>Tap on the Windows-key, type services.msc, and tap on the Enter-key. 
This opens the Windows Services Manager.</li>
<li>Locate Windows Search when the services listing opens. 
The services are sorted automatically, so jump to the bottom to find it more quickly.</li>
<li>Right-click on Windows Search and select properties from the menu.</li>
<li>Switch the startup type to "disabled".</li>
<li>Select "stop" under service status to block the service from running in that session.</li>
<li>Click apply and then ok.</li>


You may still run searches, but without indexing. 
This means that searches may take longer to complete.

The service has the following description:
This service synchronizes mail, contacts, calendar and various other user data. Mail and other applications dependent on this functionality will not work properly when this service is not running.

Well, no, I don’t care about these applications to sync, so let’s disable this OneSyncSvc. When I tried set the Service Startup Type to Disabled, I got the following error:

Services – The parameter is incorrect

Grrr, annoying, and since I’m pretty stubborn in these situations, I used my last escape: Registry Editor:

Go to the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\OneSyncSvc

Then find the name “Start” and change the value to 4. (where 4 stands for Disabled)

Since I got 3 OneSyncSvc’s, I changed it for all three keys.

The advantage of the Windows Script File (.WSF) is that it allows the user to use a combination of scripting languages within a single file.


WSH engines include various implementations for the Rexx, BASIC, Perl, Ruby, Tcl, PHP, JavaScript, Delphi, Python, XSLT, and other languages.


Scripts may be run in either GUI mode (WScript.exe) or command line mode (CScript.exe).


So in addition to ASP, IIS, Internet Explorer, CScript and WScript, the WSH can be used to automate and communicate with any Windows application with COM and other exposed objects.

C:\Windows\System32\ folder, there is a file called iexpress.exe.
Right-click it an Run as administrator.
Create a new SED and select "Extract files and run an installation command."
Add the script you want, and make sure that on the next screen, 
you set the install program to cmd /c [your_script.bat] where [your_script.bat] is the script file you want to execute. 
If you don't do this, windows will try to use Command.com (the old version of Command Prompt) which hasn't been in use for quite a while.

Select preferences (you might need to select "Store files using Long File Name inside Package), 
set an output path (to the .exe file you want to create), and select "No restart".
Click next and you should have your .exe!

Just a note, this file actually only acts as a wrapper for your script, and the script itself actually gets executed in a temp folder created on execution (and deleted afterwards), so make sure you don't use any relative paths.

<h2>How to boot a Mac from USB media</h2>
Getting your Mac to load from a USB drive is fairly straightforward.

Insert the USB boot media into an open USB slot.
Press the <strong>Power</strong> button to turn on your Mac (or <strong>Restart</strong> your Mac if it’s already on).

When you hear the startup chime, press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>Option </strong>key. Holding that key gives you access to OS X’s Startup Manager. Once the Startup Manager screen appears, release the Option key. The utility will look for any available drives that include bootable content.

Using either the pointer or arrow keys on the keyboard, select the USB drive you wish to boot from.

Once selected, either hit the <strong>Return</strong> key or double-click your selection. The machine will start to boot from the USB drive.

<strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Have multiple USB devices connected to your Mac? Don’t worry. The Startup Manager only lists drives that include bootable content.

<h2>Boot from USB: Windows</h2>

Start by plugging the thumb drive into a USB port. Then t<strong>o change the BIOS boot sequence</strong>:

Press the <strong>Power</strong> button for your computer.

During the initial startup screen, press&nbsp;<strong>ESC, F1, F2, F8</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>F10</strong>. (Depending on the company that created your version of BIOS, a menu may appear.)

When you choose to enter BIOS Setup, the setup utility page will appear.

Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, select the&nbsp;<strong><em>BOOT</em></strong>&nbsp;tab. All of the available system devices will be displayed in order of their boot priority. You can reorder the devices here.

Move <em>USB</em> to be first in the boot sequence.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you cannot find <em>USB</em> or <em>Removable Devices</em> among the device options, your BIOS may list it under <em>Hard Drive Devices</em>. In that case, you’ll need to:
	
Move <em>Hard Drive Devices</em> to the top

Expand to show all hard drive device options

Move <em>USB device</em> to the top of that hard drive list

Save the change and then exit the BIOS Setup.

The computer will restart using the new settings, booting from your USB drive.

<strong>Stay alert!</strong> Depending on your BIOS, you may be prompted with a message to&nbsp;<em>Press any key to boot from external device</em> and you will only have a few seconds to respond. If you do nothing, your computer will go to the next device in the boot sequence list, which will likely be your hard drive.

In the future, your computer will first check the USB port for boot media when starting up. That won’t be a problem, since the BIOS will move to the next device in the boot sequence ... unless you keep the boot media in the USB port. Then the system will launch from that device every time.

<h2>Linux USB Boot Process</h2>

<strong>To boot Ubuntu from USB media, the process is very similar to the Windows instructions above.</strong>

Confirm the BIOS boot sequence lists the USB drive first, or make that change as needed.

After the USB flash drive is inserted into the USB port, press the <strong>Power</strong> button for your machine (or <strong>Restart</strong> if the computer is running).

The installer boot menu will load, where you will select <em>Run Ubuntu from this USB</em>.

Ubuntu will launch and you can begin to working in the system – setting preferences, reconfiguring the system as needed, or running any diagnostic tools.

<h2>How to Run Windows 10 From a USB Drive</h2>

You will need a USB flash drive with at least 16GB of free space, but preferably 32GB. 
You will also need a license to activate Windows 10 on the USB drive. 
That means you have to either purchase one or use an existing one associated with your digital ID. 
You can then use a Windows USB utility to set up the USB drive with Windows 10. Once you're done, you'll be able to boot up off the drive to launch Windows 10. 
The one disadvantage of booting from a USB drive is that Windows 10 will run much slower than it does off your hard drive. 
But in a pinch, you can at least work with the OS and access different apps this way.
Microsoft offers its own tool called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-to-go-overview" target="_blank">Windows to Go</a>, which can generate a bootable Windows USB drive. However, that program works only with the Enterprise and Education versions of Windows 10 and requires a certified Windows to Go drive. A better (and free) option is a utility called WinToUSB, which can create a bootable drive from any version of the operating system and on any type of USB drive.

<h2>Running Windows 10 From a USB Drive</h2>
First, sign into your current Windows 10 computer to create a Windows 10 ISO file that will be used to install Windows 10 onto the USB drive. 
To do this, browse to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank">Download Windows 10 website</a>. 
This site offers the latest edition of Windows 10, which at this point is the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/feature/364187/windows-10-october-2018-update-the-best-new-features">Windows 10 October 2018 Update</a>, or Windows 10 version 1809. 
Click the Download tool now button. 
Then double-click the downloaded MediaCreationTool.exe file to install the tool.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633627-download-windows-10.png?thumb=y'>
At the first screen for "Applicable notices and license terms," click the Access button. Then click the option to "Create installation media for another PC" and click Next. At the "Select language, architecture, and edition" screen, confirm that all of the options are correct and then click Next.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633628-download-windows-10.png'>
You will then need to choose what media you want to use. Given the option between a USB flash drive and an ISO file, click ISO file. Then click Next.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633629-download-windows-10.png'>
Choose a location on your hard drive to store the Windows.iso file. Click Save. Windows 10 generates the necessary ISO file. When the process is done, click Finish.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633630-download-windows-10.png'>
<h2>Running WinToUSB (With Caveats)</h2>
Next, it's time to enlist the aid of <a href="https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/" target="_blank">WinToUSB</a>. This program is effective and user friendly, but it suffers from one major drawback. 
The <strong>free version does not support the current flavor of Windows 10</strong>&mdash;specifically the Windows 10 October 2018 Update, or Windows 10 version 1809. And Microsoft no longer offers older ISO files of Windows 10 at its download site. If you want to make a USB copy of Windows 10 version 1809 using WinToUSB, you'll have to shell out $29.95 for the Professional version.
However, <strong>there is a trick</strong> that will let you download an ISO file of the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, or Windows 10 version 1803, which you can use with the free version of WinToUSB. (Kudos to technology writer Mauro Huculak for revealing this option in an article at <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/download-windows-10-1803-iso-file-after-1809-releases/" target="_blank">Pureinfotech.com</a>.) Here's how it works.
Open <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/338998/microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge</a> on your current Windows 10 computer. Copy and paste the following URL in the address bar: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank"><strong>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</strong></a>.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633631-download-windows-10.png'>
Yes, that takes you to Microsoft's Download Windows 10 website. But wait, there's more. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect element" to open the page's code.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633632-download-windows-10.png'>
In the right pane, click the down arrow on the top menu bar and select the option for Emulation.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633633-download-windows-10.png'>
In the Mode section, open the drop-down menu for User agent string and change the entry to Apple Safari (iPad).

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633634-download-windows-10.png'>
The page in the left pane should automatically refresh. If not, refresh it manually. Click the drop-down menu for Select edition and select the option for the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Click Confirm.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633635-download-windows-10.png'>
At the next screen, choose your language, then click Confirm. On the Downloads page, choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the Windows 10 April 2018 Update and then click Save to download the file. After the file has been downloaded, change the User agent string in Edge from Apple Safari (iPad) back to Microsoft Edge (Default). Close the right pane by clicking the X.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633636-download-windows-10.png'>
<h2>Create the USB Drive</h2>
Now, let's move over to WinToUSB to create the USB drive. Download and install the WinToUSB software from <a href="http://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/" target="_blank">its dedicated website</a>. You can start with the free version and then decide if you want to upgrade to the $29.95 Professional version to gain more features or use the software with the Windows 10 October 2018 Update.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633637-windows-to-usb.png'>
Next, connect a blank USB flash drive or stick to your computer. Launch WinToUSB from its Start menu shortcut. At the introductory screen, click the button to the right of the Image File field and choose your ISO file for the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Then select the version of Windows 10 you wish to clone onto the USB stick. Click Next.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633638-windows-to-usb.png'>
At the next screen, you will need to determine your destination disk. Open the drop-down menu and choose your USB drive. A message pops up asking you to select a partition scheme. Click the option for "MBR for BIOS" and then click Yes.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633639-windows-to-usb.png'>
At the next screen, click the option for Legacy to choose the Installation mode. Click Next. Your Windows 10 USB stick will now be created.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633640-windows-to-usb.png'>
When the installation process reaches 100 percent, indicating that it's finished, close the WinToUSB program and remove the USB drive.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633641-windows-to-usb.png'>
<h2>Launch Windows 10 on a Different Computer</h2>
When you want to launch Windows 10 on a different computer, insert your USB drive into that PC and choose the option to boot up off the USB drive.

<img src='https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/633642-windows-boot-menu.png'>
The first time you run Windows 10 off the USB drive, you'll need to go through the familiar Windows setup process. You'll also need to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank">activate Windows 10</a>. You can then install apps onto the USB drive and access any files or documents stored online, so the experience comes close to working on one of your own Windows 10 PCs.

<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/rebuild-icon-clear-thumbnail-cache-windows-10">Rebuild Icon Cache in Windows 10</a>

The Icon Cache or IconCache.db is a special database file that Windows utilizes to keep copies of each icon handy. When Windows needs to draw an icon, it uses the copy from the cache instead of retrieving the icon image from the original application file. This helps in making Windows draw the icons faster. Things were different in Windows XP, and they are different in Windows 7/8. Things changed again Windows 8.1 onwards. In Windows 10, you need to do the following.

If you needed to rebuild the Icon Cache in Windows 7 / 8, you needed to do the following: Open File Explorer > Folder Options > Views to show Hidden System Files. Next, go to C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local folder and delete the hidden IconCache.db file. Reboot. This action would purge and rebuild the icon cache.

C:\Users\User\AppData\Local
But this is not enough in Windows 10 or Windows 8.1. You will have to navigate to the following folder:

C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer

<h2>How to Change Your Local Host Name</h2>

The default name of the local computer address is called "localhost." 
It is also known as the loopback address because it is the same address as the loopback network interface. 
The IP address of the localhost is "127.0.0.1." 
To change the localhost name, you have to edit the "Hosts" file in Windows.

goto "C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc"

Show hidden files

The host file located here:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc
It's called: hosts
