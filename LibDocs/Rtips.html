<h1><a name="toc-Section-1">1</a> Data Input/Output</h1>
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> Bring raw numbers into R</h2>
This is truly easy. Suppose you've got numbers in a space-separated file &ldquo;myData&rdquo;, with column names in the first row (thats a header). Run
<pre class="listing">myDataFrame &lt;- read.table(‘‘myData',header=TRUE)
</pre>

If you type &ldquo;?read.table&rdquo; it tells about importing files with other delimiters.
Suppose you have tab delimited data with blank spaces to indicate &ldquo;missing&rdquo; values. Do this:
<pre class="listing">myDataFrame&lt;-read.table("myData",sep="\t",na.strings=" ",header=TRUE)
</pre>

Be aware than anybody can choose his/her own separator. I am fond of &ldquo;|&rdquo; because it seems never used in names or addresses (unlike just about any other character I've found).
Suppose your data is in a compressed gzip file, myData.gz, use R's gzfile function to decompress on the fly. Do this:
<pre class="listing">myDataFrame &lt;- read.table(gzfile("myData.gz"), header=TRUE)
</pre>

If you read columns in from separate files, combine into a data frame as:
<pre class="listing">variable1 &lt;- scan("file1")
variable2 &lt;- scan("file2")
mydata &lt;- cbind(variable1, variable2)
#or use the equivalent:
#mydata &lt;- data.frame(variable1, variable2)
#Optionally save dataframe in R object file with:
write.table(mydata, file="filename3")
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.2">1.2</a> Basic notation on data access</h2>
To access the columns of a data frame &ldquo;x&rdquo; with the column number, say x[,1], to get the first column. If you know the column name, say &ldquo;pjVar1&rdquo;, it is the same as x$pjVar1 or x[, &ldquo;pjVar1&rdquo;].
Grab an element in a list as x[[1]]. If you just run x[1] you get a list, in which there is a single item. Maybe you want that, but I bet you really want x[[1]]. If the list elements are named, you can get them with x$pjVar1 or x[[&ldquo;pjVar1&rdquo;]].
For instance, if a data frame is &ldquo;nebdata&rdquo; then grab the value in row 1, column 2 with:
<pre class="listing">nebdata[1, 2]
## or to selectively take from column2 only when the column Volt equals "ABal"
nebdata[nebdata$Volt=="ABal", 2] 
(from Diego Kuonen)
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.3">1.3</a> Checkout the new Data Import/Export manual</h2>
With R--1.2, the R team released a manual about how to get data into R and out of R. That's the first place to look if you need help. It is now distributed with R. Run 
<pre class="listing">help.start()
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.4">1.4</a> Exchange data between R and other programs (Excel, etc)</h2>
Patience is the key. If you understand the format in which your data is currently held, chances are good you can translate it into R with more or less ease.
Most commonly, people seem to want to import Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. I believe there is an ODBC approach to this, but I think it is only for MS Windows.
In the gdata package, which was formerly part of gregmisc, there is a function that can use Perl to import an Excel spreadsheet. If you install gdata, the function to use is called &ldquo;read.xls&rdquo;. You have to specify which sheet you want. That works well enough if your data is set in a numeric format inside Excel. If it is set with the GENERAL type, I've seen the imported numbers turn up as all asterixes.
Other packages have appeared to offer Excel import ability, such as xlsReadWrite.
In the R-help list, I also see reference to an Excel program addon called RExcel that can install an option in the Excel menus called &ldquo;Put R Dataframe&rdquo;. The home for that project is <a class="URL" href="http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/rcom/">http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/rcom/</a>
I usually proceed like this.
Step 1. Use Excel to edit the sheet so that it is RECTANGULAR. It should have variable names in row 1, and it has numbers where desired and the string NA otherwise. It must have NO embedded formulae or other Excel magic. Be sure that the columns are declared with the proper Excel format. Numerical information should have a numerical type, while text should have text as the type. Avoid &ldquo;General&rdquo;.
Step 2. First, try the easy route. Try gdata's &ldquo;read.xls&rdquo; method. As long as you tell it which sheet you want to read out of your data set, and you add header=T and whatever other options you'd like in an ordinary read.table usage, then it has worked well for us.
Step 3. Suppose step 2 did not work. Then you have something irregular in your Excel sheet and you should proceed as follows. Either open Excel and clean up your sheet and try step 2 again, or take the more drastic step: Export the spread sheet to text format. File/Save As, navigate to &ldquo;csv&rdquo; or &ldquo;txt&rdquo; and choose any options like &ldquo;advanced format&rdquo; or &ldquo;text configurable&rdquo;. Choose the delimiter you want. One option is the tab key. When I'm having trouble, I use the bar symbol, &ldquo;|&rdquo;, because there's little chance it is in use inside a column of data. If your columns have addresses or such, usage of the COMMA as a delimiter is very dangerous.
After you save that file in text mode, open it in a powerful &ldquo;flat text&rdquo; editor like Emacs and look through to make sure that 1) your variable names in the first row do not have spaces or quotation marks or special characters, and 2) look to the bottom to make sure your spreadsheet program did not insert any crud. If so, delete it. If you see commas in numeric variables, just use the Edit/Search/replace option to delete them.
Then read in your tab separated data with
<pre class="listing">read.table(‘‘filename',header=T,sep=‘‘\t')
</pre>

I have tested the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; package by importing an SPSS file and it worked great. I've had great results importing Stata Data sets too.
Here's a big caution for you, however. If your SPSS or Stata numeric variables have some &ldquo;value lables&rdquo;, say 98=No Answer and 99=Missing, then R will think that the variable is a factor, and it will convert it into a factor with 99 possible values. The foreign library commands for reading spss and dta files have options to stop R from trying to help with factors and I'd urge you to read the manual and use them.
If you use read.spss, for example, setting use.value.labels=F will stop R from creating factors at all. If you don't want to go that far, there's an option max.value.labels that you can set to 5 or 10, and stop it from seeing 98=Missing and then creating a factor with 98 values. It will only convert variables that have fewer than 5 or 10 values. If you use read.dta (for Stata), you can use the option convert.factors=F.
Also, if you are using read.table, you may have trouble if your numeric variables have any &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; values, such as letters. Then R will assume you really intend them to be factors and it will sometimes be tough to fix. If you add the option as.is=T, it will stop that cleanup effort by R.
At one time, the SPSS import support in foreign did not work for me, and so I worked out a routine of copying the SPSS data into a text file, just as described for Excel.
I have a notoriously difficult time with SAS XPORT files and don't even try anymore. I've seen several email posts by Frank Harrel in r-help and he has some pretty strong words about it. I do have one working example of importing the Annenberg National Election Study into R from SAS and you can review that at http://pj.freefaculty.org/DataSets/ANES/2002. I wrote a long boring explanation. Honestly, I think the best thing to do is to find a bridge between SAS and R, say use some program to convert the SAS into Excel, and go from there. Or just write the SAS data set to a file and then read into R with read.table() or such.

merge(ds1,ds2,by.x=c(‘‘city',‘‘x1'),by.y=c(‘‘city',‘‘x1'),all=TRUE)
</pre>

The trick is to make sure R understands which are the &ldquo;common variables&rdquo; in the two datasets so it lines them up, and then all=T is needed to say that you don't want to throw away the variables that are only in one set or the other. Read the help page over and over, you eventually get it.
More examples:
<pre class="listing">experiment &lt;- data.frame(times = c(0,0,10,10,20,20,30,30), expval = c(1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4))
simul &lt;- data.frame(times = c(0,10,20,30), simul = c(3,4,5,6))
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.6">1.6</a> Add one row at a time</h2>
Question: I would like to create an (empty) data frame with &ldquo;headings&rdquo; for every column (column titles) and then put data row-by-row into this data frame (one row for every computation I will be doing), i.e.
<pre class="listing">no. time temp pressure &lt;---the headings
 1   0     100   80     &lt;---first result
 2   10    110   87     &lt;---2nd result .....
</pre>
Answer: Depends if the cols are all numeric: if they are a matrix would be better. But if you insist on a data frame, here goes:
If you know the number of results in advance, say, N, do this
<pre class="listing">df &lt;- data.frame(time=numeric(N), temp=numeric(N), pressure=numeric(N))
df[1, ] &lt;- c(0, 100, 80)
df[2, ] &lt;- c(10, 110, 87)
...
</pre>

or
<pre class="listing">m &lt;- matrix(nrow=N, ncol=3)
colnames(m) &lt;- c("time", "temp", "pressure")
m[1, ]  &lt;- c(0, 100, 80)
m[2, ] &lt;- c(10, 110, 87)
</pre>

The matrix form is better size it only needs to access one vector (a matrix is a vector with attributes), not three.
If you don't know the final size you can use rbind to add a row at a time, but that is substantially less efficient as lots of re-allocation is needed. It's better to guess the size, fill in and then rbind on a lot more rows if the guess was too small.(from Brian Ripley)

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.8">1.8</a> Check if an object is NULL</h2>
NULL does not mean that something does not exist. It means that it exists, and it is nothing.
<pre class="listing">X &lt;- NULL

This may be a way of clearing values assigned to X, or initializing a variable as &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; 
Programs can check on whether X is null

If you load things, R does not warn you when they are not found, it records them as NULL. You have the responsibility of checking them. Use
<pre class="listing">is.null(list$component)
</pre>

to check a thing named component in a thing named list.

I made a long-ish lecture about this in my R workshop (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/rRandomVariables">http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/rRandomVariables</a>)
Multivariate distributions are not (yet) in the base of R, but they are in several packages, such as MASS and mvtnorm. Note, when you use these, it is necessary to specify a mean vector and a covariance matrix among the variables. Brian Ripley gave this example: with mvrnorm in package MASS (part of the VR bundle),
<pre class="listing">mvrnorm(2, c(0,0), matrix(c(0.25, 0.20, 0.20, 0.25), 2,2))
</pre>

If you don't want to use a contributed package to draw multivariate observations, you can approximate some using the univariate distributions in R itself. Peter Dalgaard observed "a less general solution for this particular case would be&rdquo;
<pre class="listing">rnorm(1,sd=sqrt(0.20)) + rnorm(2,sd=sqrt(0.05))
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.10">1.10</a> Generate random numbers with a fixed mean/variance</h2>
If you generate random numbers with a given tool, you don't get a sample with the exact mean you specify. A generator with a mean of 0 will create samples with varying means, right?
I don't know why anybody wants a sample with a mean that is exactly 0, but you can draw a sample and then transform it to force the mean however you like. Take a 2 step approach:
<pre class="listing">R&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2)
R&gt; x &lt;- (x - mean(x))/sqrt(var(x))
R&gt; mean(x)
[1] 1.385177e-16
R&gt; var(x)
[1] 1
</pre>
and now create your sample with mean 5 and sd 2:
<pre class="listing">R&gt; x &lt;- x*2 + 5
R&gt; mean(x)
[1] 5
R&gt; var(x)
[1] 4
(from Torsten.Hothorn)
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.11">1.11</a> Use rep to manufacture a weighted data set</h2>
<pre class="listing">&gt; x &lt;- c(10,40,50,100)  # income vector for instance
&gt; w &lt;- c(2,1,3,2)       # the weight for each observation in x with the same
&gt; rep(x,w)
[1]  10  10  40  50  50  50 100 100
(from P. Malewski)
</pre>

That expands a single variable, but we can expand all of the columns in a dataset one at a time to represent weighted data
Thomas Lumley provided an example: Most of the functions that have weights have frequency weights rather than probability weights: that is, setting a weight equal to 2 has exactly the same effect as replicating the observation.
<pre class="listing">expanded.data&lt;-as.data.frame(lapply(compressed.data,
                   function(x) rep(x,compressed.data$weights)))

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-1.12">1.12</a> Convert contingency table to data frame</h2>
Given a 8 dimensional crosstab, you want a data frame with 8 factors and 1 column for frequencies of the cells in the table.
R1.2 introduces a function as.data.frame.table() to handle this.
This can also be done manually. Here's a function (it's a simple wrapper around expand.grid):
<pre class="listing">dfify &lt;- function(arr, value.name = "value", dn.names = names(dimnames(arr))) {
 Version &lt;- "$Id: dfify.sfun,v 1.1 1995/10/09 16:06:12 d3a061 Exp $"
 dn &lt;- dimnames(arr &lt;- as.array(arr))
 if(is.null(dn))
    stop("Can't data-frame-ify an array without dimnames")
    names(dn) &lt;- dn.names
    ans &lt;- cbind(expand.grid(dn), as.vector(arr))
    names(ans)[ncol(ans)] &lt;- value.name
    ans
}
</pre>
The name is short for &ldquo;data-frame-i-fy&rdquo;.
For your example, assuming your multi-way array has proper dimnames, you'd just do:
<pre class="listing">my.data.frame &lt;- dfify(my.array, value.name=‘‘frequency')

Note MASS library has a function write.matrix which is faster if you need to write a numerical matrix, not a data frame. Good for big jobs.

There are many other ways, including cbind().
Often I plan to calculate variable names within a program, as well as the values of the variables. I think of this as &ldquo;generating new column names on the fly.&rdquo; In r-help, I asked "I keep finding myself in a situation where I want to calculate a variable name and then use it on the left hand side of an assignment.&rdquo; To me, this was a difficult problem. 
Brian Ripley pointed toward one way to add the variable to a data frame:
<blockquote class="Quote">
<pre class="listing">iteration &lt;- 9
newname &lt;- paste("run", iteration, sep="")
mydf[newname] &lt;- aColumn
## or, in one step:
mydf[paste("run",iteration,sep="")] &lt;- aColumn
## for a list, same idea works, use double brackets
myList[[paste("run",iteration,sep="")]] &lt;- aColumn
</pre>

</blockquote>
And Thomas Lumley added: " If you wanted to do something of this sort for which the above didn't work you could also learn about substitute():
<pre class="listing">eval(substitute(myList$newColumn&lt;-aColumn),
     list(newColumn=as.name(varName)))
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.2">2.2</a> Create variable names &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;</h2>
The previous showed how to add a column to a data frame on the fly. What if you just want to calculate a name for a variable that is not in a data frame. The assign function can do that. Try this to create an object (a variable) named zzz equal to 32.
<pre class="listing">&gt; assign("zzz", 32) 
&gt; zzz
[1] 32
</pre>

In that case,I specify zzz, but we can use a function to create the variable name. Suppose you want a random variable name. Every time you run this, you get a new variable starting with &ldquo;a&rdquo;. 
<pre class="listing">assign(paste("a", round(rnorm(1, 50,12), 2), sep=""), 324)
</pre>

I got a44.05:<pre class="listing">&gt; a44.05 
[1] 324
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.3">2.3</a> Recode one column, output values into another column</h2>
Please read the documentation for transform() and replace() and also learn how to use the magic of R vectors.
The transform() function works only for data frames. Suppose a data frame is called &ldquo;mdf&rdquo; and you want to add a new variable &ldquo;newV&rdquo; that is a function of var1 and var2:
<pre class="listing">mdf &lt;- transform(mdf, newV=log(var1) + var2))
</pre>

I'm inclined to take the easy road when I can. Proper use of indexes in R will help a lot, especially for recoding discrete valued variables. Some cases are particularly simple because of the way arrays are processed.
Suppose you create a variable, and then want to reset some values to missing. Go like this:
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- rnorm(10000)  x[x &gt; 1.5] &lt;- NA
</pre>

And if you don't want to replace the original variable, create a new one first ( xnew <- x ) and then do that same thing to xnew.
You can put other variables inside the brackets, so if you want x to equal 234 if y equals 1, then
<pre class="listing">x[y == 1] &lt;- 234
</pre>
Suppose you have v1, and you want to add another variable v2 so that there is a translation. If v1=1, you want v2=4. If v1=2, you want v2=4. If v1=3, you want v2=5. This reminds me of the old days using SPSS and SAS. I think it is clearest to do:
<pre class="listing">&gt; v1 &lt;- c(1,2,3)# now initialize v2&gt; v2 &lt;- rep( -9, length(v1))  # now recode v2&gt; v2[v1==1] &lt;- 4&gt; v2[v1==2]&lt;-4&gt; v2[v1==3]&lt;-5&gt; v2[1] 4 4 5
</pre>

Note that R's &ldquo;ifelse&rdquo; command can work too:
<pre class="listing">x&lt;-ifelse(x&gt;1.5,NA,x)
</pre>

One user recently asked how to take data like a vector of names and convert it to numbers, and 2 good solutions appeared:
<pre class="listing">y  &lt;- c( "OLDa", "ALL",  "OLDc", "OLDa", "OLDb", "NEW", "OLDb", "OLDa", "ALL","...")&gt; el &lt;- c("OLDa", "OLDb", "OLDc", "NEW", "ALL")&gt; match(y,el)[1]  1  5  3  1  2  4  2  1  5 NA 
</pre>
or
<pre class="listing">&gt; f &lt;- factor(x,levels=c("OLDa", "OLDb", "OLDc", "NEW", "ALL") )&gt; as.integer(f)&gt;   [1] 1 5 3 1 2 4 2 1 5 
</pre>

I asked Mark Myatt for more examples:
For example, suppose I get a bunch of variables coded on a scale
<pre class="listing">1 = no   6 = yes   8 = tied   9 = missing  10 = not applicable.
</pre>
Recode that into a new variable name with 0=no, 1=yes, and all else NA.
It seems like the replace() function would do it for single values but you end up with empty levels in factors but that can be fixed by re-factoring the variable. Here is a basic recode() function:
<pre class="listing">recode &lt;- function(var, old, new){
  x &lt;- replace(var, var == old, new)   
  if(is.factor(x)) factor(x) 
  else x
}
</pre>

For the above example:
<pre class="listing">test &lt;- c(1,1,2,1,1,8,1,2,1,10,1,8,2,1,9,1,2,9,10,1)
testtest &lt;- recode(test, 1, 0)
test &lt;- recode(test, 2, 1) 
test &lt;- recode(test, 8, NA)
test &lt;- recode(test, 9, NA) 
test &lt;- recode(test, 10, NA)test
</pre>

Although it is probably easier to use replace():
<pre class="listing">test &lt;- c(1,1,2,1,1,8,1,2,1,10,1,8,2,1,9,1,2,9,10,1)
testtest &lt;- replace(test, test == 8 | test == 9 | test == 10, NA)
test &lt;- replace(test, test == 1, 0)
test &lt;- replace(test, test == 2, 1)test
</pre>

I suppose a better function would take from and to lists as arguments:
<pre class="listing">recode &lt;- function(var, from, to){
  x &lt;- as.vector(var)
  for (i in 1:length(from)){
    x &lt;- replace(x, x == from[i], to[i])
  }
 if(is.factor(var)) factor(x) 
 else x
} 
</pre>

For the example:
<pre class="listing">test &lt;- c(1,1,2,1,1,8,1,2,1,10,1,8,2,1,9,1,2,9,10,1) 
testtest &lt;- recode(test, c(1,2,8:10), c(0,1))
test
</pre>

and it still works with single values.
Suppose somebody gives me ascale from 1 to 100, and I want to collapse it into 10 groups, how do I go about it?
Mark says: Use cut() for this. This cuts into 10 groups:
<pre class="listing">test &lt;- trunc(runif(1000,1,100))
groups &lt;-cut(test,seq(0,100,10)) 
table(test, groups)
</pre>

To get ten groups without knowing the minimum and maximum value you can use pretty():
<pre class="listing">groups &lt;- cut(test, pretty(test,10)) 
table(test, groups)
</pre>

You can specify the cut-points:
<pre class="listing">groups &lt;- cut(test,c(0,20,40,60,80,100)) 
table(test, groups)
</pre>

And they don't need to be even groups:
<pre class="listing">groups &lt;- cut(test,c(0,30,50,75,100)) 
table(test, groups)
</pre>

Mark added, &ldquo;I think I will add this sort of thing to the REX pack.&rdquo;
2003--12--01, someone asked how to convert a vector of numbers to characters, such as 
<pre class="listing">if x[i] &lt; 250 then col[i] = ‘‘red' 
 else if x[i] &lt; 500 then col[i] = ‘‘blue'
</pre>

and so forth. Many interesing answers appeared in R-help. A big long nested ifelse would work, as in:
<pre class="listing">x.col &lt;- ifelse(x &lt; 250, "red",
   ifelse(x&lt;500, "blue", ifelse(x&lt;750, "green", "black"))) 
</pre>

There were some nice suggestions to use cut, such as Gabor Grothendeick's advice:
The following results in a character vector:
<pre class="listing">&gt; colours &lt;- c("red", "blue", "green","back")
&gt; colours[cut(x, c(-Inf,250,500,700,Inf),right=F,lab=FALSE)]
</pre>

While this generates a factor variable:
<pre class="listing">&gt; colours &lt;- c("red", "blue", "green","black")
&gt; cut(x, c(-Inf,250,500,700,Inf),right=F,lab=colours)
</pre>

Dave Armstrong (personal communication, 2012/5/21) brought to my attention the following problem in &ldquo;cross sectional time series&rdquo; data.

There is also a bad problem when the time points observed for the sub units are not all the same. He suggests the following
<pre class="listing">dat &lt;- data.frame(
	ccode = c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3),
	year = c(1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1981:1984, 1980:1982, 1984),
	x = seq(2,24, by=2))
​
dat$obs &lt;- 1:nrow(dat)
dat$lagobs &lt;- match(paste(dat$ccode, dat$year-1, sep="."), 
paste(dat$ccode, dat$year, sep="."))
dat$lag_x &lt;- dat$x[dat$lagobs]
</pre>

Run this example, be surprised, then email me if you find a better way. I haven't. This seems like a difficult problem to me and if I had to do it very often, I am pretty sure I'd have to re-think what it means to &ldquo;lag&rdquo; when there are years missing in the data. Perhaps this is a rare occasion where interpolation might be called for.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.6">2.6</a>  How to drop factor levels for datasets that don't have observations with those values?</h2>
The best way to drop levels, BTW, is
<pre class="listing">problem.factor &lt;- problem.factor[ ,drop=TRUE]
(from Brian D. Ripley)
</pre>

That has the same effect as running the pre-existing &ldquo;problem.factor&rdquo; through the function factor:
<pre class="listing">problem.factor &lt;- factor(problem.factor)
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.7">2.7</a> Select/subset observations out of a dataframe</h2>
If you just want particular named or numbered rows or columns, of course, that's easy. Take columns x1, x2, and x3.
<pre class="listing">datSubset1 &lt;- dat[ , c("x1","x2","x3")]
</pre>

If those happen to be columns 44, 92, and 93 in a data frame, 
<pre class="listing">datSubset1 &lt;- dat[ , c(44, 92, 93)]
</pre>

Usually, we want observations that are conditional. 
Want to take observations for which variable Y is greater than A and less or equal than B:
<pre class="listing">X[Y &gt; A &amp; Y &lt;= B ]
</pre>

Suppose you want observations with c=1 in df1. This makes a new data frame. 
<pre class="listing">df2 &lt;- df1[df1$c == 1,]
</pre>

and note that indexing is pretty central to using S (the language), so it is worth learning all the ways to use it. (from Brian Ripley)
Or use &ldquo;match&rdquo; select values from the column &ldquo;d&rdquo; by taking the ones that match the values of another column, as in
<pre class="listing">&gt; d &lt;- t(array(1:20,dim=c(2,10)))
&gt; i &lt;- c(13,5,19)
&gt; d[match(i,d[,1]), 2]
[1] 14  6 20
(from Peter Wolf)
</pre>

Till Baumgaertel wanted to select observations for men over age 40, and sex was coded either m or M. Here are two working commands:
<pre class="listing"># 1.) 
maleOver40 &lt;- subset(d, sex %in% c("m","M") &amp; age &gt; 40)
# 2.) 
maleOver40 &lt;- d[(d$sex == "m" | d$sex == "M") &amp; d$age &gt;40,]
</pre>

To decipher that, do ?match and ?&ldquo;%in&rdquo; to find out about the %in% operator. 
If you want to grab the rows for which the variable &ldquo;subject&rdquo; is 15 or 19, try:
<pre class="listing">df1$subject %in% c(19,15)
</pre>

to get a True/False indication for each row in the data frame, and you can then use that output to pick the rows you want:
<pre class="listing">indicator &lt;- df1$subject %in% c(19,15)
df1[indicator,]
</pre>

How to deal with values that are already marked as missing? If you want to omit all rows for which one or more column is NA (missing):
<pre class="listing">x2 &lt;- na.omit(x)
</pre>

produces a copy of the data frame x with all rows that contain missing data removed. The function na.exclude could be used also. For more information on missings, check help : ?na.exclude.
For exclusion of missing, Peter Dalgaard likes
<pre class="listing">subset(x,complete.cases(x)) or x[complete.cases(x),]
</pre>

adding &ldquo;is.na(x) is preferable to x !=&rdquo;NA"
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.8">2.8</a> Delete first observation for each element in a cluster of observations</h2>

7 CSCO   19910103      0.1527778      0.1458333         166
</pre>
remove the first observation for each value of the &ldquo;sym&rdquo; variable (the one coded ABK,CSCO, etc). . If you just need to remove rows 1, 6, and 13, do:
<pre class="listing">newhilodata &lt;- hilodata[-c(1,6,13),]
</pre>
To solve the more general problem of omitting the first in each group, assuming &ldquo;sym&rdquo; is a factor, try something like
<pre class="listing">newhilodata &lt;- subset(hilodata, diff(c(0,as.integer(sym))) != 0)
</pre>
(actually, the as.integer is unnecessary because the c() will unclass the factor automagically)
(from Peter Dalgaard)
Alternatively, you could use the match function because it returns the first match. Suppose jm is the data set. Then:
<pre class="listing">&gt; match(unique(jm$sym), jm$sym)
 [1]  1  6 13
&gt; jm &lt;- jm[ -match(unique(jm$sym), jm$sym), ]
</pre>

As Robert pointed out to me privately: duplicated() does the trick
<pre class="listing">subset(hilodata, duplicated(sym))

has got to be the simplest variant.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.10">2.10</a> Selecting Variables for Models: Don't forget the subset function</h2>
You can manage data directly by deleting lines or so forth, but subset() can be used to achieve the same effect without editing the data at all. Do ?select to find out more. Subset is also an option in many statistical functions like lm.
Peter Dalgaard gave this example, using the &ldquo;builtin&rdquo; dataset airquality.
<pre class="listing">data(airquality)
names(airquality)
lm(Ozone~., data=subset(airquality,select=Ozone:Month))
lm(Ozone~., data=subset(airquality,select=c(Ozone:Wind,Month)))
lm(Ozone~.-Temp, data=subset(airquality,select=Ozone:Month))
</pre>

The &ldquo;.&rdquo; on the RHS of lm means &ldquo;all variables&rdquo; and the subset command on the rhs picks out different variables from the dataset. &ldquo;x1:x2&rdquo; means variables between x1 and x2, inclusive.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.11">2.11</a> Process all numeric variables, ignore character variables?</h2>
This was a lifesaver for me. I ran simulations in C and there were some numbers and some character variables. The output went into &ldquo;lastline.txt&rdquo; and I wanted to import the data and leave some in character format, and then calculate summary indicators for the rest.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.12">2.12</a> Sorting by more than one variable</h2>

<pre class="listing">name  M
1234  8
1234  8.3
4321  9
4321  8.1
</pre>

I also would like to set a cut-off, so that anything below a certain values will not be sorted.(from Kong, Chuang Fong)
I take it that the cutoff is on the value of M. OK, suppose it is the value of ‘coff'.
<pre class="listing">sort.ind &lt;- order(name, pmax(coff, M))  #  sorting index
name &lt;- name[sort.ind]
M &lt;- M[sort.ind]
</pre>

Notice how using pmax() for &ldquo;parallel maximum&rdquo; you can implement the cutoff by raising all values below the mark up to the mark thus putting them all into the same bin as far as sorting is concerned.
If your two variables are in a data frame you can combine the last two steps into one, of course.
<pre class="listing">sort.ind &lt;- order(dat$name, pmax(coff, dat$M))
dat &lt;- dat[sort.ind, ]
</pre>

In fact it's not long before you are doing it all in one step:

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-2.14">2.14</a> Work with missing values (na.omit, is.na, etc)</h2>
NA is a &ldquo;symbol&rdquo;, not just a pair of letters. Values for any type of variable, numeric or character, may be set to NA. Thus, in a sense, management of NA values is just like any other recoding exercise. Find the NAs and change them, or find suspicious values and set them to NA. Matt Wiener (2005--01--05) offered this example, which inserts some NA's, and then converts them all to 0.
<pre class="listing">&gt; temp1 &lt;- matrix(runif(25), 5, 5)
&gt; temp1[temp1 &lt; 0.1] &lt;- NA
&gt; temp1[is.na(temp1)] &lt;- 0
</pre>

When routines encounter NA values, special procedures may be called for. 
For example, the mean function will return NA when it encounters any NA values. That's a cold slap in the face to most of us. To avoid that, run mean(x, na.rm=TRUE), so the NA's are automatically ignored. Many functions have that same default (check max, min).
Other functions, like lm, will default to omit missings, unless the user has put other settings in place. The environment options() has settings that affect the way missings are handled.
Suppose you are a cautious person. If you want lm to fail when it encounters an NA, then the lm argument na.action can be set to na.fail. Before that, however, it will be necessary to change or omit missings. To manually omit missings, then sure missings are omitted by telling lm to fail if it finds NAs.
<pre class="listing">thisdf &lt;- na.omit(insure[,c(1, 19:39)]) 
body.m &lt;- lm(BI.PPrem ~ ., data = thisdf, na.action = na.fail) 
</pre>

The function is.na() returns a TRUE for missings, and that can be used to spot and change them.
The table function defaults to exclude NA from the reported categories. To force it to report NA as a valid value, add the option exclude=NULL in the table command.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-3.1">3.1</a> Create a vector, append values</h2>
Some things in R are so startlingly simple and different from other programs that the experts have a difficult time understanding our misunderstanding.
Mathematically, I believe a vector is a column in which all elements are of the same type (e.g., real numbers). (1,2,3) is a vector of integers as well as a column in the data frame sense. If you put dissimilar-typed items into an R column, it creates a vector that reduces the type of all values to the lowest type. Example:
<pre class="listing">&gt; a &lt;- c("a", 1, 2, 3, "hello") 
&gt; is.vector(a) 
[1] TRUE 
&gt; is.character(a) 
[1] TRUE
&gt; as.numeric(a) 
[1] NA  1  2  3 NA 
Warning message: NAs introduced by coercion
</pre>

This shows that an easy way to create a vector is with the concatenate function, which is used so commonly it is known only as &ldquo;c&rdquo;. As long as all of your input is of the same type, you don't hit any snags. Note the is.vector() function will say this is a vector:
<pre class="listing">&gt; v &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) 
&gt; is.vector(v) 
[1] TRUE 
&gt; is.numeric(v) 
[1] TRUE
</pre>
The worst case scenario is that it manufactures a list. The double brackets [[]] are the big signal that you really have a list:
<pre class="listing">&gt; bb &lt;- c(1,c,4) 
&gt; is.vector(bb) 
[1] TRUE 
&gt; bb   
[[1]] 
[1] 1 
[[2]] 
.Primitive("c") 
[[3]] 
[1] 4 
&gt; is.character(bb) 
[1] FALSE 
&gt; is.integer(bb) 
[1] FALSE 
&gt; is.list(bb) 
[1] TRUE 
</pre>
To make sure you get what you want, you can use the vector() function, and then tell it what type of elements you want in your vector. Please note it puts a &ldquo;false&rdquo; value in each position, not a missing.
<pre class="listing">&gt; vector(mode="integer",10) 
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
&gt; vector(mode="double",10) 
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
&gt; vector(mode="logical",10) 
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 
</pre>

There are also methods to directly create the particular kind of vector you want (factor, character, integer, etc). For example, if you want a real-valued vector, there is a shortcut method numeric()
<pre class="listing">&gt; x &lt;- numeric(10)
&gt; x
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</pre>

If you want to add values onto the end of a vector, you have options!
If you want to add a single value onto the vector, try:
<pre class="listing">&gt; r &lt;- rnorm(1) 
&gt; v &lt;- append(v, r) 
</pre>

The length() command can not only tell you how long a vector is, but it can be used to RESIZE it. This command says if the length of v has reached the value vlen, then expand the length by doubling it.
<pre class="listing">if (vlen == length(v)) length(v) &lt;- 2*length(v)

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-3.13">3.13</a> Compute partial correlation coefficients from correlation matrix (<b>08/12/2000</b>)</h2>
I need to compute partial correlation coefficients between multiple variables (correlation between two paired samples with the &ldquo;effects of all other variables partialled out&rdquo;)? (from Kaspar Pflugshaupt)
Actually, this is quite straightforward. Suppose that R is the correlation matrix among the variables. Then,
<pre class="listing">Rinv&lt;-solve(R)
        D&lt;-diag(1/sqrt(diag(Rinv)))
        P&lt;- -D %*% Rinv %*% D

The off-diagonal elements of P are then the partial correlations between each pair of variables &ldquo;partialed&rdquo; for the others. (Why one would want to do this is another question.)
(from John Fox).
In general you invert the variance-covariance matrix and then rescale it so the diagonal is one. The off-diagonal elements are the negative partial correlation coefficients given all other variables.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-3.18">3.18</a> Create Upper or Lower Triangular matrix</h2>
The most direct route to do that is to create a matrix X, and then use the upper.tri() or lower.tri() functions to take out the parts that are needed. 
To do it in one step is trickly. Whenever it comes up in r-help, there is a different answer. Suppose you want a matrix like
<pre class="listing">a^0  0    0
a^1  a^0  0
a^2  a^1  a^0
</pre>

I don't know why you'd want that, but look at the differences among answers this elicited.

&gt; out
</pre>

(from Woodrow Setzer)
If you want an upper triangular matrix, this use of "ifelse" with outer looks great to me:
<pre class="listing">&gt; fun &lt;- function(x,y) { ifelse(y&gt;x, x+y, 0) } 
&gt; fun(2,3) 
[1] 5 
&gt; outer(1:4, 1:4, fun)

&gt; fun &lt;- function(x, y) { ifelse(y&lt;=x, a^(x+y-1), 0) }

During the Summer Stats Camp at KU in 2012, a user wanted to import a file full of numbers that were written by Mplus and then convert it to a lower triangular matrix. These need to end up in row order, like so:
<pre class="listing">1 0 0 0 0
2 3 0 0 0
4 5 6 0 0
7 8 9 10 0
11 12 13 14 15
</pre>

The data is a raw text file called &ldquo;tech3.out&rdquo;. The first solution I found used a function to create symmetric matrices from the package miscTools (by Arne Henningsen and Ott Toomet). This creates a full matrix, and then I &ldquo;obliterate&rdquo; the upper right side by &ldquo;writing over&rdquo; with 0's.
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- scan("tech3.out")
library(miscTools)
​
dat1 &lt;- symMatrix( x, nrow=90, byrow = TRUE)
upperNoDiag &lt;- upper.tri(dat1, diag = FALSE)
dat1[upperNoDiag] &lt;- 0
fix(dat1) 
</pre>

To find out why that works, just type &ldquo;symMatrix&rdquo;. The relevant part of Arne's code is
<pre class="listing">if (byrow != upper) {
    result[upper.tri(result, diag = TRUE)] &lt;- data
    result[lower.tri(result)] &lt;- t(result)[lower.tri(result)]
}
</pre>

Once we fiddle around with that idiom a bit, we see that the magic is in the way R's matrix receives a vector and &ldquo;automagically&rdquo; fills in the pieces. Because we want to fill the rows, it turns out we have to first fill the columns of an upper triangular matrix and then transpose the result. 
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- 1:6
xmat &lt;- matrix(0, 3 ,3)
xmat[upper.tri(xmat, diag = TRUE)] &lt;- x
result &lt;- t(xmat)
​
&gt; result
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    0    0
[2,]    2    3    0
[3,]    4    5    6
</pre>

This pre-supposes I've got the correct number of elements in x. The main advantage of symMatrix for us is that it checks the size of the vector against the size of the matrix and reports an error if they don't match up properly.

so the first vector says that I have 6 elements therefore I have to make a 6 by 6 matrix and then I have to read 5 elements from the second vector , and put 1 in [1,j] where j=2,3,4,5,6 and put zero elsewhere( i.e.~in [1,1]) and so on. Any idea how this can be done in R ?

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.2">5.2</a> Save graph output</h2>
There are two ways to save and/or print graphs. You can create the graphs on screen, and then copy them into a file, or you can write them directly into a file. This is explained in greater depth in my R lecture notes, plot-2 (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/plot-2/plot-2.pdf">http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/plot-2/plot-2.pdf</a>). Graphs that are written directly into a file are more likely to come out correctly, so lets concentrate there.
Run this.
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- rnorm(100)
png(file = "mypng-1.png", height = 800, width = 800)
hist(x, main = "I'm running this and won't see anything on the screen")
dev.off()
</pre>

The dev.off() is a file saver statement. It means &ldquo;finish the file&rdquo;. In the terminal, you see &ldquo;null device&rdquo;. Whatever, it worked. A file appears in the current working directory &ldquo;mypng-1.png&rdquo;. Look at that with an image viewer. Now try another one
<pre class="listing">png(file = "mypng-2.png", height = 300, width = 800, pointsize = 8)
hist(x, main = "I'm running this and won't see anything on the screen")
dev.off()
</pre>

Nothing appears on the screen. R knows the size you want (800 x 800 in pixels). I adjusted the pointsize for fun. You can play with settings. 
You don't want a png file? OK, lets try PDF, which is now the recommended format for making graphs that end up in research papers. We used to use postscript, so most of my documentation used to be about EPS. But now, PDF. So run this
<pre class="listing">pdf(file = "mypdf-1.pdf", height = 6, width = 6, onefile = FALSE, paper = "special")
hist(x, main = "If there is no PDF at the end of this, I'll be mad")
dev.off()
</pre>

NB: height and width are in inches, NOT pixesl, with the pdf device. I usually only use the png and pdf devices, but I have sometimes tested others, like SVG (scalable vector graphics) and fig (files that can be edited with xfig). 
I'm pushing the point that you create the output device, you run the plot commands, and then dev.off(). That works, but it is not useful for planning a plot. You need to see it on the screen, right? R plot functions draw on screen devices by default. As a result, the research work flow is to run the graph commands, look at them on the screen, and then go back and run png(<span class="formula">…</span>) or pdf(<span class="formula">…</span>) line, then re-run the graphing commands, concluding with dev.off().
I know students ignore this advice, and they think it is a hassle. They create graphs on screen and then use File -&gt; Save As or such from some GUI IDE. Sometimes, they end up with horrible looking graphs. Sizes and shapes turn out wrong. The reason is that the R graph they see on the screen is not seamlessly copied into a file output. 
You can reproduce that kind of trouble if you want to. When I'm in a hurry, this is what I do. First, I create an &ldquo;on screen&rdquo; device with about the right size. On all platforms, from an R console, this will do so
<pre class="listing">dev.new(height = 7, width = 7)
</pre>

If you happen to be using RStudio, you will get an error message indicating that the function is not available. In that case, on Windows, replace dev.new() with windows(). On Mac, replace it with quartz(). On Linux, X11() is a safe bet. Your system may have other on-screen devices as well. I chose to make a square graph, you don't have to if you don't want to.
After you make the graph look just right, you can save it as a PDF like so:
<pre class="listing">dev.copy(pdf, file = "myfile.pdf", height = 7, width = 7, onefile = FALSE)
dev.off()
</pre>

Back in the olden days of postscript, the onefile = FALSE argument was vital to get the bounding box that put the &ldquo;encapsulated&rdquo; into EPS, rather than plain old postscript. I still use it now with PDF, although I don't think it has much effect. 
If you want to save the same as a picture image, say a png file with white background, do
<pre class="listing">dev.copy(png, filename = "myfile.png", height = 600, width = 800, bg = "white")
dev.off()
</pre>

In my experience, the bg argument is ignored and the background always turns out transparent. 
Note you can also set the pointsize for text. Peter Dalgaard told me that on postscript devices, a point is 1/72nd of an inch. If you expect to shrink an image for final presentation, set a big pointsize, like 20 or so, in order to avoid having really small type.
The dev.copy approach works well OFTEN. Sometimes, however, it is bad. It cuts off the margin labels, it breaks legend boxes. So if you do that, well, you get what you deserve. I've learned this the hard way, but sending out papers with bad graphs and I did not notice until it was too late. 
R uses the term ‘‘device' to refer to the various graphical output formats. The command dev.off() is vital because it lets the device know you are finished drawing in there. There are many devices representing kinds of file output. You can choose among device types, postscript, png, jpeg, bitmap, etc. (windows users can choose windows metafile). Type
<pre class="listing">?device 
</pre>

to see a list of devices R finds on your system. There is a help page for each type of device, so you can run ?png, ?pdf, ?windows to learn more.
After you create a device, check what you have on:
<pre class="listing">dev.list() 
</pre>

And, if you have more than one device active, you tell which one to use with dev.set(n), for the n device. Suppose we want the third device:
<pre class="listing">dev.set(3) 
</pre>

For me, the problem with this approach is that I don't usually know what I want to print until I see it. If I am using the jpeg device, there is no screen output, no picture to look at. So I have to make the plot, see what I want, turn on an output device and run the plot all over in order to save a file. It seems complicated, anyway.
The pdf and postscript devices have options to output multiple graphs, one after the other. They can either be drawn as new pages inside the single file's output (onefile = TRUE), or one can use a customized file name to ask for it to create one file per graph. 
If you use dev.copy(), you may run into the problem that your graph elements have to be resized and they don't fit together the way you expect. The default on-screen device (for me, X11(), for you maybe windows() or quartz()) size is 7in x 7in, but postscript size is 1/2 inch smaller than the usable papersize. That mismatch can spell danger. 
The dev.print() function, as far as I can see, is basically the same as dev.copy(), except it has two features. First, the graph is rescaled according to paper dimensions, and the fonts are rescaled accordingly. Due to the problem mentioned above, not everything gets rescaled perfectly, however, so take care. Second, it automatically turns off the device after it has printed/saved its result.
<pre class="listing">dev.print(device = postscript, file = "yourFileName.ps")
</pre>

A default jpeg is 480x480, but you can change that:
<pre class="listing">jpeg(filename="plot.jpg" width = 460, height = 480, pointsize = 12, quality = 85) 
</pre>

As of R1.1, the dev.print() and dev.copy2eps() will work when called from a function, for example:
<pre class="listing">ps &lt;- function(file="Rplot.eps", width=7, height=7, ...) { 
        dev.copy2eps(file=file, width=width, height=height, ...) 
   } 
data(cars) 
plot(cars) 
ps() 
</pre>

The mismatch of ‘‘size' between devices even comes up when you want to print out an plot. This command will print to a printer:
<pre class="listing">dev.print(height=6, width=6, horizontal=FALSE) 
</pre>

You might want to include pointsize=20 or whatever so the text is in proper proportion to the rest of your plot.
One user observed, ‘‘Unfortunately this will also make the hash marks too big and put a big gap between the axis labels and the axis title\ldots{}', and in response Brian Ripley observed: "The problem is your use of dev.print here: the ticks change but not the text size. dev.copy does not use the new pointsize: try
<pre class="listing">x11(width = 3, height = 3, pointsize = 8) 
x11(width = 6, height = 6, pointsize = 16) 
dev.set(2) 
plot(1:10) 
dev.copy() 
</pre>

Re-scaling works as expected for new plots but not re-played plots. Plotting directly on a bigger device is that answer: plots then scale exactly, except for perhaps default line widths and other things where rasterization effects come into play. In short, if you want postscript or pdf, use postscript() or pdf() directly.
The rescaling of a windows() device works differently, and does rescale the fonts. (I don't have anything more to say on that now)
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.3">5.3</a> How to automatically name plot output into separate files</h2>
Use this notation for the file name: %03d is in the style of old-fashioned fortran format statements. It means use 3 digit numbers like 001, 002, etc.
<pre class="listing">postscript(file="test3-%03d.ps", onefile = FALSE, paper = "special") 
</pre>

will create postscriptfiles called test3-001.ps, test3-002.ps and so on (from Thomas Lumley).
<pre class="listing">pdf(file="test3-%03d.pdf", onefile = FALSE, paper = "special")

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.10">5.10</a> How can I ‘‘overlay' several line plots on top of one another?</h2>
This is a question where terminology is important.
If you mean overlay as in overlay ‘‘slides' on a projector, it can be done. This literally super-imposes 2 graphs.
Use par(‘‘new' = TRUE) to stop the previous output from being erased, as in
<pre class="listing">tmp1 &lt;- plot(acquaint ~ x, type = 'l', ylim = c(0,1), ylab = "average  proportion", xlab = "PERIOD", lty = 1, pch = 1, main = "") 
par("new" = TRUE) 
tmp2 &lt;- plot(harmony ~ x, type = 'l', ylim = c(0,1), ylab = "average  proportion", xlab = "PERIOD", lty = 2, pch = 1, main = "") 
par("new" = TRUE) 
tmp3 &lt;- plot(identical ~ x, type = 'l', ylim = c(0,1), ylab = "average proportion", xlab = "PERIOD", lty = 3, pch = 1, main = "") 
</pre>

Note the par() is used to overlay ‘‘high' level plotting commands.
Here's an example for histograms:
<pre class="listing">hist(rnorm(100, mean = 20, sd = 12), xlim = range(0,100), ylim = range(0, 50)) 
par(new = TRUE) 
hist(rnorm(100, mean = 88, sd = 2), xlim = range(0, 100), ylim = range(0, 50)) 
</pre>

The label at the bottom is all messed up. You can put the option xlab=&rdquo;&rdquo; to get rid of them.
There are very few times when you actually want an overlay in that sense. Instead, you want to draw one graph, and then add points, lines, text, an so forth. That is what the R authors actually intend.
First you create the baseline plot, the one that sets the axes values. Then add points, lines, etc. Here are some self-contained examples to give you the idea.
Here's a regression example
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- rnorm(100)
e &lt;- rnorm (100)
y &lt;- 12 + 4*x +13 *e
mylm &lt;- lm(y ~ x )
plot(x, y, main = "My regression")
abline(mylm)
</pre>

From Roland Rau in r-help:
<pre class="listing">hist(rnorm(10000), freq = FALSE)
xvals &lt;- seq(-5,5,length = 100)
lines(x = xvals, y = dnorm(xvals))
</pre>

Here's another example that works great for scatterplots
<pre class="listing">x1 &lt;- 1:10 
x2 &lt;- 2:12 
y1 &lt;- x1+rnorm(length(x1)) 
y2 &lt;- .1*x2+rnorm(length(x2)) 
plot(x1, y1, xlim = range(x1, x2), ylim = range(y1, y2), pch = 1) 
points(x2, y2, pch = 2) 
(from Bill Simpson)
</pre>

If you just want to plot several lines on a single plot, the easiest thing is to use ‘‘matplot' which is intended for that kind of thing. But plot can do it too.
Here's another idea: form a new data.frame and pass it through as y:
<pre class="listing">plot(cbind(ts1.ts, ts2.ts), xlab = "time", ylab = "", plot.type = "single") 
</pre>

or better something like: <pre class="listing">plot(cbind(ts1.ts, ts2.ts), plot.type = "single", 
 col=c("yellow", "red"), lty = c("solid","dotted")) #colours and patterns 
</pre>

It can also be helpful to contrast ‘c(ts1.ts,ts2.ts)' with ‘cbind(ts1.ts,ts2.ts)'. (from Guido Masarotto)
For time series data, there is a special function for this:
<pre class="listing">ts.plot(ts1.ts, ts2.ts) # same as above
</pre>

See help on plot.ts and ts.plot (from Brian D. Ripley)
Often, I find myself using the plot command to plot nothing, and then fill in beautiful stuff with text, lines, points, and so forth. If you plot 2 variables with type=‘‘n', then the inside of the graph is empty.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.11">5.11</a> Create ‘‘matrix' of graphs</h2>
If you want a quick &ldquo;scatterplot&rdquo; matrix, run pairs() or plot() on a data frame. 
Do you want to run individual plot commands and have them placed in an array on the output graph? There are two ways, the basic par(mfrow=?) or par(mfcol=?) or a more advanced layout() function. 
Here is how to get started with a 2x3 array of plots:
<pre class="listing">par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
</pre>

And then the next 6 plot/image commands will be laid out in a 2 row x 3 column arrangement.
The layout option can give a powerful set of controls for that kind of thing as well, e.g. (from Paul Murrell):
<pre class="listing">layout(matrix(c(1, 0, 2), ncol = 1), heights = c(1, lcm(5), 1))
plot(x)
box("figure", lty = "dashed")
plot(x)
box("figure", lty = "dashed")
</pre>

I think you have data with like:
<pre class="listing">xx &lt;- data.frame(y = rnorm(100),
                 x1 = as.factor(round(runif(100, 1, 4))),
                 x2 = as.factor(round(runif(100, 1, 4)))
                 )
attach(xx)
by(y, list(x1,x2), plot)
by(y, list(x1,x2), function(x) print(x))
xn &lt;- as.integer(x1)
## either use coplot or par(mfrow =) approach:
coplot(y ~ xn | x2)
##or you use a loop:
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
for( i in unique(as.integer(x1))) plot.default(x2 [as.integer(x1) == i]
                                          , y[as.integer(x1) == i ]
                                          , main = paste("Code:", i)
                                          )
##of course there might be ways to use tapply, lapply etc.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.13">5.13</a> Regression scatterplot: add fitted line to graph</h2>
The usual recommendation is to use this stanza, which only works when there is only one predictor

plot(y ~ x, data = dat)
# simplest way to add a straight line
abline(reg)
</pre>

If you have more predictors, then you need to think on what you intend to plot.
<pre class="listing">reg &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = dat)
termplot(reg, se = TRUE, resid = TRUE)
</pre>

Will cycle through the predictors. There's another nice looking approach I suggest in the rockchalk package
<pre class="listing">library(rockchalk)
plotSlopes(reg, plotx = "x2", interval = "confidence")
</pre>

The plotx argument has to be a numeric predictor. That can also draw interaction plots for either numeric or factor moderator variables.
<pre class="listing">library(rockchalk)
plotSlopes(reg, plotx = "x2", modx = "x3", interval = "confidence")
</pre>

I've got a lot of little bells and whistles so users can customize the chosen values of the moderator and other variables. Just run example(plotSlopes) to get the idea.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.14">5.14</a> Control the plotting character in scatterplots?</h2>
Plots show dots:
<pre class="listing">plot(rnorm(100),rnorm(100),pch=‘‘.')

</pre>

Plots with numbers indicating values of a third variable:
<pre class="listing">text(tx, ty, label = ch, col = ‘‘red', bg = ‘‘yellow', cex = 3)
</pre>

If you specify pch, only the first character is taken as the symbol for your point.
Matt Wiener suggested creating a color vector and then using the value of another value to control both the lable and the color:
<pre class="listing">col.vec &lt;- c("black", "red", "blue")
text(chem.predict[,1:2], labels = km$cluster, color =
col.vec[km$clusters])
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.15">5.15</a> Scatterplot: Control Plotting Characters (men vs women, etc)}</h2>

If true, use character 20. Else use character 1. Experiment with

plot(x, y, pch = pchs[(z &lt; 0)+1])
text(x, y, labels = round(z, 2), pos = 1, offset = 0.5)
</pre>

Roger adds, ‘‘This 'cuts" the z vector at zero, using the convenient slight-of-hand that TRUE and FALSE map to integers 1 and 0, and thus gives the pch argument in plot() or points() a vector of values of indices of the pchs vector. More generally, use cut() to break a numeric vector into class intervals (possibly within ordered())."

More recently, Paul Murrell has observed:
"The drawing of xlab and ylab ignores the par(las) setting. You can override this ‘‘sensible' default behaviour if it annoys you. For example, you can stop plot() drawing xlab and ylab by something like plot(ann=FALSE) or plot(xlab=‘‘', ylab=‘‘') AND you can draw them yourself using mtext(), which does listen to par(las).

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.22">5.22</a> Axes: Show formatted dates in axes</h2>
Try package &ldquo;date&rdquo;, available at CRAN. Example for plotting:
<pre class="listing">library(date)
plot.date(.....) 
## if x-values are dates, you can also use plot(...) after loading the data package
## because plot is a generic function
(from Uwe Ligges)
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.23">5.23</a> Axes: Reverse axis in plot</h2>
Ross Ihaka says do the following:
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- rnorm(100)
y &lt;- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y, xlim=rev(range(x)), ylim=rev(range(y)))
</pre>

<pre class="listing">plot(x, -y, axes=FALSE)
axis(1)
axis(2)

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.24">5.24</a> Axes: Label axes with dates</h2>
I have to plot the data set like the following.

&gt; y &lt;- c(10,20,15, ...)
</pre>

You should try the package ‘‘date', available at CRAN. Example:
<pre class="listing">library(date)
x &lt;- as.date(c("05/27/2000","06/03/2000","08/22/2000"))
y &lt;- c(10,20,15)
plot(x,y)
(from Uwe Ligges)

Here is one using chron.
<pre class="listing">library(chron)
x &lt;- dates(c("05/27/00","06/03/00","08/22/00"))
y &lt;- c(10,20,15)

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.25">5.25</a> Axes: Superscript in axis labels</h2>

Question: When I plot them default x axis takes place on the bottom of the chart and the y axis takes place on the left of the chart. Is it possible to make axes pass from the origin.
Maybe this helps (put what you what for x, y):

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.27">5.27</a> Add ‘‘error arrows' to a scatterplot</h2>
I think using arrows(... , code=3, angle=90, ....) is quite simple, e.g.:
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- rnorm(10)
y &lt;- rnorm(10)
se.x &lt;- runif(10)
se.y &lt;- runif(10)
plot(x, y, pch=22)
arrows(x, y-se.y, x, y+se.y, code=3, angle=90, length=0.1)
arrows(x-se.x, y, x+se.x, y, code=3, angle=90, length=0.1)
(from Emmanuel Paradis)
</pre>

The first arrows() draws the error bars for y, and the second one for x, ‘code=3' draws a head at both ends of the arrow, ‘angle=' is the angle of the head with the main axis of the arrow, and ‘length=' is the length of the head. You can also add usual graphic parameters (col, lwd, \ldots{}).
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.28">5.28</a> Time Series: how to plot several ‘‘lines' in one graph?</h2>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.38">5.38</a> Animate a Graph!</h2>
It is quite easy to do with ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org), which can be installed on most OSes. I tried this simple sequence and it worked beautifully.
In R, create 15 histograms:
<pre class="listing">for(i in 1:5) {
 jpeg(paste("fig", i, ".jpg", sep = ""))
 hist(rnorm(100))
 dev.off()

Then from the command line (I tried it using Linux, though it should be the same on any platform):
<pre class="listing">% convert -delay 50 -loop 50 fig*.jpg animated.gif

This created animated.gif, a nice animation of my sequence of files. You can control the timing of the animation by playing with -delay and -loop. (from Matthew R. Nelson, Ph.D. )
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-5.39">5.39</a> Color user-portion of graph background differently from margin</h2>

<h1><a name="toc-Section-6">6</a> Common Statistical Chores</h1>
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-6.1">6.1</a> Crosstabulation Tables</h2>
A crosstab facility xtabs() was introduced in R1.2. Read all about it in help. table is there too.
These give counts, not percentages. There are special functions for that. Here's code that creates a table and then calls &ldquo;prop.table&rdquo; to get percents on the columns:
<pre class="listing">&gt; x&lt;- c(1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,4,4)     
&gt; y &lt;- c(2,4,1,4,2,4,1,4,2,4)     
&gt; hmm &lt;- table(x,y) &gt; prop.table(hmm,2) * 100 
</pre>

If you want to sum the column, there is a function &ldquo;margin.table()&rdquo; for that, but it is just the same as doing a sum manually, as in:
apply(hmm, 2, sum)
which gives the counts of the columns.
If you have an old R, here is a &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; crosstab
<pre class="listing">&gt;count &lt;- scan()

On 2005--01--05, Brian Ripley proposed one way to make a table that has the &ldquo;value&rdquo; being counted in the first column (for tables of counts that works nicely for non-factor variables)
<pre class="listing">&gt;xx &lt;- unique(x)  
&gt;rbind(vals=xx, cnts=tabulate(match(x, xx)))   
</pre>

Check this out! User wants to count outcomes by categories and make a single table list. Thomas Lumley says (2005--01--04), "table() will count frequencies, and interaction() will create a variable with all combinations of a set of variables, so something like
<pre class="listing">&gt;table(interaction(f1,f2)) 
</pre>
works."

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-6.6">6.6</a> BY subgroup analysis of data (summary or model for subgroups)(06/04/2001)</h2>
Question: I want summary information by subgroup.
Answer: This can be done with tapply, or the by() function, which is a &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; (that means &ldquo;simplifying enhancement&rdquo;) of tapply.
Use like so. If you have groups defined by a factor A, to get summaries of variables x through z in dataframe &ldquo;fred&rdquo;,
<pre class="listing">&gt;attach(fred)
&gt;by(fred[,x:z], A, summary)
</pre>
You can make a list of factors for a multidimensional set of groups, and many different functions can be put in place of &ldquo;summary&rdquo;. See the by documentation.
Before by, we did it like this, and you may need it for some reason.
Get the average of a variable &ldquo;rt&rdquo; for each subgroup created by combinations of values for 3 factors.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.2">7.2</a> Summary Methods, grabbing results inside an &ldquo;output object&rdquo;</h2>
(<b>17/02/2002</b>)
Brian Ripley: By convention summary methods create a new object of class print.summary.foo which is then auto-printed.
Basically, you find out what's in a result, then grab it. Suppose a fitted model is &ldquo;fm3DNase1&rdquo;:
<pre class="listing">&gt; names(summary(fm3DNase1))[1] "formula"      "residuals"    "sigma"        "df"           "cov.unscaled"[6] "correlation"  "parameters"  &gt; summary(fm3DNase1)$sigma[1] 0.01919449&gt; summary(fm3DNase1)$parametersEstimate Std.

The t-values are

You can also use

Here's another one along the same lines. Bill Venables (Feb.2,00) said the philosophy is &ldquo;You fit a larger model that contains the given model as a special case and test one within the other.&rdquo; "Suppose you wonder if a variable x Suppose you have only one predictor with repeated values, say x, and you are testing a simple linear regression model. Then you can do the test using

anova(inner.mod, outer.mod)
</pre>
Test for lack of fit done. If you have several predictors defining the repeated combinations all you need do is paste them together, for example, and make a factor from that. (from Bill Venables)
Suppose your data frame x has some column, say, ID, which identifies the various cases, and you fitted
<pre class="listing">fit1 &lt;- lm(y ~ rhs, data=df)
</pre>
Now do
<pre class="listing">fit2 &lt;- lm(y ~ factor(ID), data=df)
anova(fit1, fit2, test="F")
</pre>
e.g.
<pre class="listing">set.seed(123)

df$y &lt;- 3*df$x+rnorm(nrow(df))
fit1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data=df)
fit2 &lt;- lm(y ~ factor(ID), data=df)
anova(fit1, fit2, test="F")
</pre>
there is an R package lmtest on CRAN, which is full of tests for linear models. (from Brian Ripley)
The models with factor() as the indep variable are the most general because they individually fit each category, whereas using the variable X assumes linearity (from me!)
Here's another example. &ldquo;I want to know how much variance of pre/post-changes in relationship satisfaction can be explained by changes in iv1 and iv2 (dv <span class="ensuremath"> ~ </span> iv1 + iv2), by changes in iv3 and iv4 (dv <span class="ensuremath"> ~ </span> iv3 + iv4) and I want to know wether a model including all of the iv's explains a significant amount of variance over these two models (dv <span class="ensuremath"> ~ </span> iv1 + iv2 + iv3 + iv4).&rdquo;

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.5">7.5</a>  Get Predicted Values from a model with predict()</h2>
Suppose you fit a model &ldquo;lm1&rdquo;. That model is supposed to include methods fitted() and predict().
If you want the predicted value for each nonmissing case, do
<pre class="listing">&gt; predict(lm1)
</pre>
predict has a lot more power because it can tell you the predicted values for a certain set of inputs into the model. Give it a dataframe as the second argument. That new data frame must have (at least) all of the variables in the original model. For example,
<pre class="listing">x&lt;-c(1,3,2,1,4,1,4,NA)
y&lt;-c(4,3,4,1,4,1,4,2)
mod1 &lt;-m(y~x) 
testdataframe&lt;-data.frame(x=c(1)) predict(mod1,newdata=testdataframe)
</pre>
Or:
<pre class="listing">&gt; lot &lt;- c(30,20,60,80,40,50,60,30,70,60)
&gt; hours &lt;-c(73,50,128,170,87,108,135,69,148,132)
&gt; z1 &lt;- lm(hours~lot) 
&gt; newdf &lt;- data.frame(lot=80) 
&gt; predict(z1,newdata=newdf,interval="confidence",level=0.90)
     fit      lwr      upr[1,] 170 166.9245 173.0755
</pre>
Please note, there is a difference between &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;prediction&rdquo; in this command. One is the confidence interval of the point estimate, the other is the confidence interval for a prediction about an individual case.
Read carefully the documentation on your model. If you use glm to fit a model, you can read the docs for it with
<pre class="listing">?predict.glm
</pre>
. In particular, the predict method for glm can calculate various types of predictions, the value of the &ldquo;linear predictor&rdquo; X(b-hat) or it can give the transformed value, such as the probability in a logistic regression. The option there is type=&ldquo;link&rdquo; for the X(b-hat) or type=&ldquo;response&rdquo; for the probability that corresponds to X(b-hat). Know what I mean, either X(b-hat) or 1/(1-exp(-X(b-hat))).
Lately, I've been teaching regression and it is really really hard for newcomers to get predicted values for &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; cases. We've gone through all kinds of tedious routines to calculate the &ldquo;new data frame&rdquo; so that the output from predict is interesting and useful for graphs.
Suppose your old data frame is &ldquo;olddf&rdquo; and you want to create a new data frame for a problem with predictors X1,X2,X3,X4. One idea is to set X2, X3, X4 at their means and then allow X1 to vary from 1 to 10. This works:
<pre class="listing">mymod1 &lt;- glm(Y~X1+X2+X3+X4, data=olddf, family=binomial(link=logit))
newdf &lt;- data.frame(X1=1:10,X2=mean(olddf$X2),X3=mean(olddf$X3),X4=mean(olddf$X4))
p1 &lt;- predict(mymodl1,newdata=data.frame,type="response")
plot(1:10,p1, main="Logistic demonstration graph with X2,X3,X4 at mean values")
</pre>
That provides a plot that people like.
It is impossibly tedious to keep re-generating data frames to explore the variables. There are some shortcuts. In R's base, there is a function called expand.grid (more on that in a moment). In the Design library from Prof. Harrell, the &ldquo;datadist&rdquo; procedure is used to create information about the variables that is used in automatically creating that kind of plot. However, sometimes, the plots are not exactly what one might like. But usually they are pretty good, at least as a starting point. To make a plot demonstrating X1, it will set other variables to their means if they are numeric and to their modes if they are not numeric.
In the end, however, a person may want to calculate predicted values for a variety of different outputs. Here is where the function &ldquo;expand.grid&rdquo; comes in very handy. If one specifies a list of values to be considered for each variable, then expand.grid will create a &ldquo;mix and match&rdquo; data frame to represent all possibilities.
<pre class="listing">&gt; x &lt;- c( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
&gt; y &lt;- c( 22.1, 33.2, 44.4 )
&gt; expand.grid(x,y)
   Var1 Var2
1     1 22.1
2     2 22.1
3     3 22.1
4     4 22.1
5     1 33.2
6     2 33.2
7     3 33.2
8     4 33.2
9     1 44.4
10    2 44.4
11    3 44.4
12    4 44.4
</pre>
So, if you create the new data frame with
<pre class="listing">newdf &lt;- expand.grid(X1,X2,X3,X4)
</pre>
, then put that as newdata into predict and one easily obtains all of the desired information.
Note many models have a &ldquo;fitted&rdquo; attribute and there is the accessor function fitted. If you use fitted() on a model, it may not return what you expect. For lm() it gives the same as predict, but not for glm(). The default for predict() gives the &ldquo;linear predictor&rdquo;, while fitted gives the value of &ldquo;mu&rdquo; (inverse link applied to linear predictor). fitted(mod) equals predict(mod,ndf,type=&ldquo;response&rdquo;).

To make a table showing how factors affect the fitted or predicted values, Brian Ripley says (2003--11--29) ":<br/>
 allergy$fitted <- fitted(allergy.fit.main.2int) xtabs(fitted <span class="ensuremath"> ~ </span> t + f + c, data=allergy)
and you permute the dimensions by reordering the factors…. xtabs generates a call to table() which could be used directly.
In this case there were no repeated (and no missing) combinations of factors: if there has been just predict the model at all combinations and apply xtabs/table to the predictions."

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.15">7.15</a> Test for homogeneity of variance (heteroskedasticity)</h2>
Bartlett's test, I like (personally). SPSS now uses Levene's test, some say incorrectly and nonrobustly. lmtest package offers many heteroskedasticity estimators. There is an implementation of Levene's test in the car package.
The test &ldquo;does an anova on a modified response variable that is the absolute value of the difference between an observation and the median of its group (more robust than Levene's original choice, the mean)&rdquo;. (from Brian Ripley)
Incidentally, if you insist on having Levene's calculation, Brian Ripley showed how it can be done manually:
<pre class="listing">&gt;Levene &lt;- function(y, group){
     group &lt;- as.factor(group)  # precautionary
     meds &lt;- tapply(y, group, median)
     resp &lt;- abs(y - meds[group])
     anova(lm(resp ~ group))[1, 4:5]
 }
​
&gt; data(warpbreaks)
&gt; attach(warpbreaks)
&gt; Levene(breaks, tension)
     F value  Pr(&gt;F)
  group   2.818 0.06905
</pre>
&rdquo;I could (and probably would) dress it up with a formula interface, but that would obscure the simplicity of the calculation.&rdquo;
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.16">7.16</a> Use nls to estimate a nonlinear model</h2>
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- runif(100)
w &lt;- runif(100)
y &lt;- x^2.4*w^3.2+rnorm(100,0,0.01)
plot(x,y)
plot(w,y)
library(nls)
fit &lt;- nls(y~x^a*w^b,start=list(a=2,b=3))
l.est &lt;- lm(log(y) ~ log(x)+log(w)-1)
fit &lt;- nls(y~x^a*w^b,start=list(a=coef(l.est)[1],b=coef(l.est)[2]))
</pre>
Error is a fairly common result of starting with parameter values that are far away from the true values, or have very different scales, so that the numeric-derivative part of nls fails. Various solutions are to do an approximate least-squares regression to start things off (also the &ldquo;self-starting&rdquo; models in the nls package), or to provide an analytic derivative. (all from Ben Bolker)
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.17">7.17</a> Using nls and graphing things with it</h2>
If you use the nls function in R to fit the model in the parameterization that Guido described, you can graphically examine the profile likelihood with
<pre class="listing">pr &lt;- profile(nlsObject)
 plot(pr)
</pre>
For an example, try

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.18">7.18</a> <span class="formula"> − 2<i>Log</i>(<i>L</i>)</span> and hypo tests</h2>
This is about the polr package, but the general point is that to compare likelihood models, you have to use your head and specify the comparison. Brian Ripley said:
As in the example on the help page
<pre class="listing">options(contrasts=c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly"))
     data(housing)
     house.plr &lt;- polr(Sat ~ Infl + Type + Cont, weights = Freq, data = housing)
     house.plr0 &lt;- polr(Sat ~ 1, weights = Freq, data = housing)
</pre>
Note that --2 LOG L is not actually well-defined as it depends on the grouping of the data assumed, and so is not a statistic. I assume that you want differences of that quantity, as in

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.19">7.19</a> logistic regression with repeated measurements</h2>
Hiroto Miyoshi described an experiment with 2 groups and pre/post measurement of a dichotomous dependent variable. Frank Harrell had this excellent response:
"There are several ways to go. GEE is one, random effects models another. One other approach is to install the Hmisc and Design packages (http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s) and do (assume id is the unique subject identifier):

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.20">7.20</a> Logit</h2>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.21">7.21</a> Random parameter (Mixed Model) tips</h2>
Since the lme/nlme support in R is cutting-edge and Doug Bates is an author and frequent R contributor, this is one of the packages that is worth looking at. When I see useful tidbits, I'm putting them here:
Test whether one should use a model with mixed effects or just a plain old linear model:
Bates wrote (2005--01--05) &ldquo;I would recommend the likelihood ratio test against a linear model fit by lm. The p-value returned from this test will be conservative because you are testing on the boundary of the parameter space.&rdquo;
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.22">7.22</a> Time Series: basics</h2>
You have to load the ts library! try
<pre class="listing">library(ts)
example(acf)
</pre>
There are other packages with time series components. Try
<pre class="listing">help.search("time")
</pre>
to see whatever you have installed. Under my packages section of this document, I keep a running tally of packages that have time series stuff in them
Many time series procedures want to operate on a &ldquo;time series&rdquo; object, not raw numbers or a data frame. You can create such an object for &ldquo;somedataframe&rdquo; by:
<pre class="listing">myTS &lt;- ts(as.matrix(somedataframe), start=c(1992,1), frequency=12)
</pre>
Note start and frequence designate time attributes.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.23">7.23</a> Time Series: misc examples</h2>
This uses the ts package's filter(): A simple exponential weighted moving average procedure would be
<pre class="listing">ewma &lt;- function (x, lambda = 1, init = 0){
  y &lt;- filter(lambda*x, filter=1-lambda, method="recursive", init=init)
  return (y)
}
</pre>
Using ewma as a forecast function is known as exponential smoothing. Try, e.g.:
<pre class="listing">x &lt;- ts(diffinv(rnorm(100)))
y &lt;- ewma(x,lambda=0.2,init=x[1])
plot(x)
lines(y,col="red")
</pre>
(from Adrian Tripletti)
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.24">7.24</a> Categorical Data and Multivariate Models</h2>
For a dichotomous dependent variable, use the glm function in R: <pre class="listing">aLogitModel &lt;- glm(yx, family=binomial(link=logit))
</pre>
 or <pre class="listing">aProbitModel &lt;- glm(yx, family=binomial(link=probit))
</pre>
 See Jim Lindsey's package &ldquo;ordinal&rdquo;.
And also Proportional Odds Logistic Regression in the MASS package
The VGAM package has a variety of these models: <a class="URL" href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~yee/VGAM/">http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~yee/VGAM/</a>.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.25">7.25</a> Lowess. Plot a smooth curve</h2>
library(modreg)
Users report confusion about the difference between lowess() in S and loess in R. Martin Maechler advised us, &ldquo;loess() by default is not resistant/robust where as lowess() is. … I would recommend using loess(….., family =&rdquo;sym&ldquo;)&rdquo;
R-base has &ldquo;lowess&rdquo;
The package &ldquo;modreg&rdquo; has &ldquo;loess&rdquo;. The latter is a linear modeling-alike tool,and it can be used with other R-base tools for dealing with linear models, like the residuals function:
<pre class="listing">&gt; l &lt;- loess(y1~x1)
&gt; plot(l)
&gt; r &lt;- residuals(l)
</pre>
r is now a variable holding residuals.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.26">7.26</a> Hierarchical/Mixed linear models.</h2>
User asked to estimate what we call a &ldquo;contextual regression,&rdquo; a model of individuals, many of whom are in the same subsets (organizations, groups, etc). This is a natural case for a mixed regression model
Jose C. Pinheiro and Douglas M. Bates, Mixed Effect Models in S and S-Plus (Springer,2000).
The nlme package for R has a procedure lme that estimates these models.
In MASS, one can find the glmmPQL procedure, which can fit generalized linear models with random parameters. It repeatedly calls the lme function from the nlme package to estimate the models.
See also Jim Lindsey's repeated measurements package (available at <a class="FlexURL" href="http://alpha.luc.ac.be/~lucp0753/rcode.html">http://alpha.luc.ac.be/~lucp0753/rcode.html</a>).
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.27">7.27</a> Robust Regression tools</h2>
Robust Regression is available in S, its name is rreg.
There's better robust regression in the MASS package.
<pre class="listing">&gt;library(MASS)
&gt;help(rlm)
&gt;library(lqs)
&gt;help(lqs)
(from Thomas Lumley)
</pre>

You could try function rlm in package MASS (in the VR bundle). That has an MM option, and was originally written to work around problems with the (then) version of lmRobMM in S-PLUS. It uses lqs in package lqs, and that is substantailly faster than the ROBETH-based code (as I started with that route). (from Brian D. Ripley)
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.28">7.28</a> Durbin-Watson test</h2>
The car and lmtest packages both have functions for Durbin-Watson tests. (John Fox)
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-7.29">7.29</a> Censored regression</h2>
You can do a censored regression with the survival5 package
<pre class="listing">library(survival5)
survreg(Surv(y,c), dist="normal")
</pre>
where y is the censored dep-var and c is 1 if observed and 0 otherwise. (from Dan Powers)

In the old days, when there were 200 packages, I could know what they were for and say &ldquo;get this&rdquo; and &ldquo;get that&rdquo;. Now there are 3,600 and obviously that's crazy. I just have to lead by example. In addition to the recommended packages that are delivered with R, I have, as of 2012-02-13.

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-8.2">8.2</a> Install and load a package</h2>
<pre class="listing">install.packages("lmtest", dep=c("Depends"))
</pre>

That installs &ldquo;lmtest&rdquo; to the default library folder. The dep argument is for dependencies. It says I want additional packages on which lmtest depends. If you also want packages that lmtest suggests, just run it with dep=c(&ldquo;Depends&rdquo;,&rdquo;Suggests&rdquo;). If you want everything linked to lmtest, dep=T gives the largest selection.
If you run that as an administrator, it will install packages to your main R installation's library folder. If you are not, R may check to see if it can find a place for packages in your own user folders.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-8.3">8.3</a> List Loaded Packages</h2>
<pre class="listing">search()
</pre>

displays packages that have been loaded by library() or require() as well as data frames that are attached.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-8.4">8.4</a> Where is the default R library folder? Where does R look for packages in a computer?</h2>
Depending on your setup, R can check in many locations when you ask to load a package. Run &ldquo;.libPaths()&rdquo;, including the period at the beginning. Here's what I see.
<pre class="listing">&gt; .libPaths()
[1] "/home/pauljohn/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.14"
[2] "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
[3] "/usr/lib/R/site-library"
[4] "/usr/lib/R/library"
</pre>

The separate paths are useful because different install methods can be used in a system and this keeps them separate. If I'm not the administrator, they go into my home folder, as you see above in item [1]. The fourth folder in the list is the one that R provided when it was installed. On Debian Linux, the path [2] is used for packages that are delivered as Debian &ldquo;deb&rdquo; packages.
If you only see one path in the output from your computer, it probably means you need to do some system administration work to add more paths. Read ?.libPaths. On my system, those paths are set in an environment file, /etc/R/Renviron.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-8.5">8.5</a> Detach libraries when no longer needed</h2>
Use detach(package:…), for instance:
<pre class="listing">&gt; search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"    "package:ctest" "Autoloads"     "package:base" 
&gt; detach(package:ctest)
&gt; search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"   "Autoloads"    "package:base"

<h1><a name="toc-Section-9">9</a> Misc. web resources</h1>
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-9.1">9.1</a> Navigating R Documentation</h2>
R is delivered with a set of manuals
<pre class="listing">help.start()
</pre>

They are also available online. Go to any CRAN mirror site (follow CRAN link on <a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</a>) . Choose a mirror, look for &ldquo;Documentation&rdquo; on the left side of the page. The &ldquo;Manuals&rdquo; and &ldquo;FAQs&rdquo; links point to the same materials that are delivered with R itself.
There are also contributed docs, which are donated by the community: <a class="URL" href="http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html">http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html</a>. Where once we (R users) had no introductory material at all, there is now a profusion, as it appears at least 50 different people have written a &ldquo;Beginners guide to R&rdquo;. 
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-9.2">9.2</a> R Task View Pages</h2>
For me, navigating the R web material is frustrating because I never find things in the same way twice. You are unlikely to find these, unless you know they are there. 
Task Views are written by the experts, who survey what packages are available. On any CRAN mirror, they are in a folder web/views, as in: <a class="FlexURL" href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views">http://cran.r-project.org/web/views</a>. Many of these Task View essays are absolutely fabulous! I can't say strongly enough my admiration to the authors who have obviously poured a massive effort into preparing concise and comprehensive reviews.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-9.3">9.3</a> Using help inside R(13/08/2001)</h2>
help(function) same as ?function
help.search(&ldquo;something&rdquo;) searches in all available functions from all loaded packages for the word &ldquo;something&rdquo;. 
Don't forget that help.search takes regular expressions (as its help describes)
<pre class="listing">R&gt; help.search(".*trans.*")
Help files with name or title matching ‘.*trans.*':
​
boxcox(MASS)             Box-Cox Transformations for Linear Models 
gilgais(MASS)            Line Transect of Soil in Gilgai Territory 
heart(MASS)              The Stanford heart transplant data 
(Thomas Lumley)
</pre>

There is also an &ldquo;apropos&rdquo; function, similar in nature to emacs. If you have a vague idea of what you want, try it. Want to find how to list files? Do:
<pre class="listing">apropos("files")
</pre>
Often you don't know the keyword to look for.
In my opinion, by far the best feature introduced in the last few years is RSiteSearch. A command like
<pre class="listing">RSiteSearch("logistic regression")
</pre>

Will search in an online system. It brings up a web page, showing that you have searched in package function listings. Adjust the radio dial to add the search of the r-help email list, and you will really make some progress.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-9.4">9.4</a> Run examples in R</h2>
See &ldquo;example&rdquo; at end of output in help?
Try
<pre class="listing">&gt; ?ls

&gt; example(lm)
&gt; example(mean)

Graphs go by too fast? The default in R is now set like this:
par(ask=TRUE)

<h1><a name="toc-Section-10">10</a> R workspace</h1>
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-10.1">10.1</a> Writing, saving, running R code</h2>
The easiest thing is to use some editor, Emacs or Winedit, write your R code, and then run it into R, and if it fails, change it in the editor, run it it again. Emacs with ESS installed will make this work fine. I've heard of plugins for other editors, did not try them, though.
If you don't like that, you can type commands directly into the R window and they have some handy things.
Up and down arrows cycle through the history of commands.
If you type in a function and want to revise it:
fix(f) or g <- edit(f) should bring up an editor.
I personally don't see any point in this, though, since you should just use an editor.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-10.2">10.2</a> .RData, .RHistory. Help or hassle?</h2>
When you quit R, since version 1 or so, it asks if you want to save the workspace. If you say yes, it creates a file .RData. The next time you start R in this working directory, it opens all those objects in .RData again. Type &ldquo;objects()&rdquo; to see.
If you want that, OK. If you don't, say NO at quit time, or erase the .RData file before starting R.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-10.3">10.3</a> Save &amp; Load R objects</h2>
If you try

rm(list=ls()) # removes all objects found by ls()
</pre>

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-10.5">10.5</a> Remove objects by pattern in name</h2>
To better understand this, do a Web search for &ldquo;regular expression matching.&rdquo; Suppose you want to remove objects beginning with lm (lm1, lm2, lm3 etc).
<pre class="listing">rm(list=objects(pattern="^lm.*")) 
(from Kjetil Kjernsmo)
</pre>

Don't do this to remove all objects with names like g01, g02, etc: 
<pre class="listing">rm(list=ls(pat="g*"))
</pre>
That removes everything! To remove objects whose names have &ldquo;g&rdquo; anywhere in the string, use <pre class="listing">rm(list=ls(pat="g"))
</pre>
, or names starting with &ldquo;g&rdquo; one can use <pre class="listing">rm(list=ls(pat="^g"))
</pre>

The caret &ldquo;^&rdquo; and dollar sign &ldquo;$&rdquo; are regex symbols tha represent the beginning and ending of a string. 
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-10.6">10.6</a> Save work/create a Diary of activity</h2>
consider sink(&ldquo;filename&rdquo;)
The file .Rhistory contains commands typed on Unix systems.
Emacs users can run R in a shell and save everything in that shell to a file.
Ripley added: But if you are on Windows you can save the whole console record to a file, or cut-and-paste sections. (And that's what I do on Unix, too.)
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-10.7">10.7</a> Customized Rprofile</h2>
In your HOME directory, the file ~/.Rprofile. For example, if you think the stars on significance tests are stupid, follow Brian Ripley's example:
<pre class="listing">options(show.signif.stars=FALSE)
ps.options(horizontal=FALSE)
</pre>
There is a system-wide Rprofile you could edit as well in the distribution

Commands to the operating system: system(&ldquo;insert command here between quotes&rdquo;).
For the particular case of changing directories use getwd/setwd [I think system() spawns its own shell, so changing directories with system() isn't persistent] . For example:
<pre class="listing">&gt; getwd()   ## start in my home directory
[1] "/home/ben"
&gt; system("cd ..")  ## this executes OK but ...
&gt; getwd()
[1] "/home/ben"    ## I'm still in the same working directory
&gt; setwd("..")      ## this is the way to change working directory
NULL
&gt; getwd()          ## now I've moved up one

This is the number of seconds since the epoch (Jan 1, 1970). I use it as a &ldquo;time stamp&rdquo; on files sometimes.
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-11.3">11.3</a> Check if a file exists</h2>
The function file.exists() will do this
<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-11.4">11.4</a> Find files by name or part of a name (regular expression matching)</h2>
Do 
<pre class="listing">list.files()
</pre>

list.files() gives back a vector of character strings, one for each file matching the pattern. Want file names ending in .dat? Try:
<pre class="listing">myDat &lt;- list.files(pattern="\\.dat$")
</pre>
Then iterate over this myDat object, using the elements myDat[[i]] if you do something to each file.
<b>Please note</b> patterns in R are supposed to be regular expressions, not ordinary shell wildcards. Regular expressions are fairly standard in unix, but each version has its wrinkles. To see about the grep command, or about apropos, where regexp is used, do:
<pre class="listing">?grep
or
?apropos
</pre>
Martin Maechler spelled out a few of the basics for me:
<pre class="listing">"."  means  ‘‘any arbitrary character'
"*"  means  ‘‘the previous [thing] arbitrary many (0,1,...) times'
              where [thing] is a single character (or something more general
                                                   for advanced usage)

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-12.2">12.2</a> Commenting out things in R files</h2>
Put ## at beginning of line, or
&ldquo;With a good code editor none of these are any problem. There is no reason to write many lines of comments in R code: that's what the .Rd file is for. And if you want to temporarily delete a block, if(0) { … } will work, as indeed will temporarily deleting in an editor.&rdquo; (from Brian D. Ripley)
Don't forget Emacs with ESS has the ability to comment-out a highlighted region:
M-x comment-region
or, more simply, highlight a section and type M-; (that's alt and semicolon on most systems).

<h2><a name="toc-Subsection-13.1">13.1</a> Character encoding</h2>
With increasing frequency, I have noticed the problem that when I copy text from R, it shows up in the output with noise characters, like a quotation mark that shows up as *&amp;\ or whatever. It turns out this is a matter of &ldquo;character encoding&rdquo;, and in the r-help list on 2009--01--27, Duncan Murdoch made an absolutely beautiful post about it.
<pre class="listing">This looks like an encoding problem:  there are several different standards for encoding non-ASCII characters.  All of your tools have to agree on the encoding.
To my eye it looks as though in the first case R is writing out UTF-8, and whatever you are using to look at your .tex file is assuming latin1 (some Windows programs say "ANSI", but I think that doesn't fully specify the encoding:  you also need a code page, which is set somewhere in Windows control panel.)
The functions related to encodings in R are:
 options(encoding="latin1")  - set the default encoding
 iconv(x, from="latin1", to="UTF-8")  - re-encode entries, mapping each character from one encoding to the other
 Encoding(x) - display the encoding of each entry (unknown means ascii or the native encoding for your platform)
 Encoding(x) &lt;- "latin1" - change the declared encoding, without changing the bytes.
