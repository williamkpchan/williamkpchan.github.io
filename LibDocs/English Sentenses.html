"I am a long time AutoCAD user and started using Revit intensively in last few years. ",
"I always love their cool products, ",
"so it's kind of heartbreaking to see how their service has become. ",
"It all started with the subscription plan.",
"Autodesk stopped selling perpetual licenses and sell their product for a term based. ",
"Obviously, there is a market for a short-term based license. ",
"But it's supposed to be an alternative. ",
"Legally, no one may borrow your computer and use the Autodesk product that is assigned to you. ",
"Technically, assigning the licenses is troublesome and problematic. ",
"I lost count of how many times I failed to assign a license to a user smoothly. ",
"Mostly it needs several attempts and some time.",
"And the worst is: Autodesk products now check the license regularly to Autodesk server. ",
"Unless now it becomes regular the server thinks you don't have a license. ",
"Even if you do have an active subscription. ",
"I count at least four times it happened.",
"The most noticeable is when Andrew Anagnost sent emails to all subscription customers after the issue after AutoCAD 2019 was released. ",
"Andrew also apologized and promised it won't happen again on his Twitter account.",
"Again, sorry it happened and it won't happen again. ",
"However, it took less than a month until the issue happened again. ",
"This time, not only the license is accessible, the contract manager will have to reassign the license to their users.",
"this was a processing error on our end—all systems are now operating as they should. ",
"Imagine if they have many different products and dozens of users. ",
"That is a very bad day for the contract manager.",
"The subscription plan itself made the customers unhappy. ",
"Now while Autodesk is trying to convince the customers that subscription plan is much better than perpetual license, this issue happened. ",
"Remember: it never happens with a perpetual license.",
"People start to lose their trust to Autodesk. ",
"Imagine how much time they lost not able to use the software, how much work they put to solve the issue. ",
"The number of the customers who are looking for an alternative is increasing. ",
"If it becomes expensive, many big companies are fine with it. ",
"But because we're building it as a platform, we're able to offer it for much less.",
"'What happens when the human aspect of the human-to-technology collaboration is rendered obsolete; when the technology becomes efficient enough on its own, actively replacing the human in the equation?'",
"80% of them dropped off after 10 seconds, but 200 people watched until the video was 90% through, and you know that those people are much more likely to buy, so with the app you send a push notification to just those people.",
"97% of Millennials are either mobile only or on multi-devices.",
