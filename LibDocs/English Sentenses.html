"Don’t Look To Your Past While Creating Your Future",
"I’m looking forward to the future, and feeling grateful for the past.",
"But don’t look to it when creating your vision for your ideal future.",
"Your past shouldn’t dictate your future. ",
"Then decide where you’ll go and what you’ll become. ",
"That’s far more fascinating and interesting. ",
"And your future absolutely should be something entirely different from what’s happened in the past. ",
"What Got You Here Won’t Get You There",
"If you’ve been successful in the past, that success can be a suppressant to future success. ",
"What got you here, won’t get you there. ",
"But don’t live there. ",
"And certainly don’t remain attached to THAT identity.",
"Gabor Maté, your personality isn’t you. ",
"Your personality is how you’re showing up in various contexts.",
"Each and every relationship you have with a different person is a personality - you’re a different person in each relationship because the RELATIONSHIP is what creates meaning between you and the other people",
"They’re how you’re showing up. ",
"Personality isn’t a permanent thing, as most Western thinkers believe. ",
"It’s not something you’re born and die with. ",
"Your personality isn’t what shapes your behavior. ",
"According to Tony Robbins, you get in life what you’re willing to tolerate. ",
"Your personality is a reflection of what you’re willing to tolerate from yourself. ",
"Your other personalities are a reflection of what you’re willing to tolerate in each of your other relationships with other people and with other things.",
"Psychologists call this self-signaling - and it’s how you change your identity and relationships.",
"You must be willing to destroy anything in your life that isn’t excellent.",
"Rather than sitting and watching TV with your lover, which may be the current personality of that relationship, why don’t you do something more compelling?",
"Personality doesn’t shape behavior. ",
"You’re Not Bound By The Current Relationship",
"Whether with yourself or someone else, you’re not bound by the current relationship you have. ",
"It’s about doing the right thing. ",
"It’s about being radically honest with yourself and everyone around you.",
"It’s about appearing to be moving - though without much regard for the direction you’re going. ",
"As Ryan Holiday has said, “This is a fundamental irony of most people’s lives. ",
"They don’t quite know what they want to do with their lives. ",
"Clarity about where you’re going and who you’re becoming is essential to getting there.",
"Stop What You’re Doing and Get Organized",
"If you want to get in shape, you’ll make more progress by stopping your negative behaviors than starting good ones. ",
"Until you stop the damage, you’ll always be taking one step forward and one step backward.",
"Until you do this, it doesn’t matter how much money you make. ",
"You’ll always spend what you have (or more).",
"Rather than wanting more, more, more , it’s key to take proper care of what you currently have. ",
"As Paul Arden said, “Don’t look for the next opportunity. ",
"What good is planting if you don’t prepare the soil and remove the weeds?",
"I have so much to do today that I’m going to need to spend three hours in prayer in order to be able to get it all done.",
"If you’re not regularly taking time to get clear and organized, chances are you’ve gotten busy doing the wrong things.",
"If you’re not regularly getting clear, your future won’t be bigger than your past. ",
"You won’t be able to make conscious and radical upgrades.",
"If you take some time every day to get clear, you’ll be stunned by the simplicity of what you actually need to DO is. ",
"Powerful progress isn’t complex. ",
"When you give yourself a good chunk of time in the morning to get clear, you’ll know where you should be focusing that day. ",
"You’ll know who you need to reach out to and what you need to say.",
"It’s how you change the trajectory and pattern of relationships.",
"That’s imagination.",
"Most people don’t even take the time to imagine a brilliant future. ",
"They’ve played-it out in their mind with such intoxicating detail that they become satisfied enough, and deceive themselves into believing they’ve actually done something.",
"What you DO determines what you’ll BE which determines what you’ll HAVE.",
"If I believed my best song was already written, I wouldn’t keep writing.",
"He said that every time he sits down to write a book, he tries to create something better than he’s ever done before.",
"John Burke, the Emmy-nominated pianist once said that every time he begins a new project, he tries to do something he’s never done before. ",
"Only by trying stuff beyond anything he’s ever done is he’s able to innovate and push his own creative boundaries. ",
"Don’t worry about what you’ve done or what you’ve created in the past. ",
"It doesn’t matter where you’ve been.",
"It doesn’t matter what you’ve done —neither the good nor the bad.",
"When you’re contemplating your future, your past should have little to do with that creative and imaginative process.",
"Your personality doesn’t define you. ",
"It’s simply an expression of your relationship with yourself and what’s around you. ",
"And that’s exactly what you need to do if your future is going to be bigger than your past.",
