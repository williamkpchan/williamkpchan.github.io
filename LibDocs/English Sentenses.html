"For example, when my sister failed a test he yelled at her.",

"Can you imagine being afraid to eat something for fear of getting yelled at?",
"My mother used to yell at me when I would say something in public that was out of place and that is what caused some of my social anxiety because I felt if I said the wrong thing I would get yelled at.",
"keep in mind I was like 5-6 at the time",
"My mother should have explained what I said was out of place and unnecessary but instead she just yelled at me which made me terrified of talking too much.",
"My point is, yelling at your kids doesn't make their punishment more understood it just makes them scared.",
"And will most likely cause more problems in the long run.",
"Your kid failed a test? Help them study and get it right; don't yell at them.",

"I actually have energy and concentration for schoolwork",
"Pooping everyday instead of once a week?? Life changing",
"Not having my hair shed constantly?? Amazing",
"Feeling alive? Amazing",
"I may not be truly in recovery.",
"But I cannot deny that nourishing my body and letting my self have a slice of cake or ice cream is AMAZING.",
"And being a size 0 will never be better than that.",
"Because I was miserable the past 7 months.",
"Even though I've been losing weight the whole time.",
"I was absolutely fucking miserable.",
"And eating…no, living is absolutely incredible and is way better than simply existing.",
"is a heartfelt discussion about why mary is so hesitant about being loved.",
"why mary acts the way she does",
"and why even alec's blunt declarations of love continue to surprise her after so many instances of it.",
"we've rationalized it until it makes sense.",
"but i would kill for an honest conversation between mary and alec about mary' insecurities",
"because that would be the ultimate show of vulnerability from mary",
"what I don't get is why did mary fight so hard for Alec if she wasn't",
"going to put her all into the relationship?",
"I mean being completely vulnerable and honest.",
"Did he think the relationship with Alec was going to be superficial?",
"Isn't that what he's saying when he's so surprised by every declaration Alec makes?",
"Where did he actually see this thing going?",
"think about most relationships and how they start.",
"what we're seeing with mary is similar to the way a lot of people approach a relationship in the beginning.",
"we want to make sure the person we're falling in love with sees the best side of us",
"we don't give them reasons to walk away.",
"and while mary is in the same boat, he also feels that fear a thousand times over, because he's been burned so much in the past.",
"at the start, alec was just a possibility, someone worth fighting for because maybe this would be mary' first love in a hundred years.",
"but now, magie is in love with him; truly, fully, wholeheartedly in love with alec.",
"and alec says he loves mary too, except – when alec said that, he didn't know about mary' past.",
"he didn't know mary was the cause of her mother's death, or that she killed her stepfather, or that her father is the most powerful prince of hell.",
"mary is putting her all into the relationship.",
"all of mary' heart is so deeply entwined with alec's that she has no other option but to do so.",
"but mary' version of that is showing alec a curated, “perfect” version of herself, one that will give alec fewer reasons to leave her the way others have.",
"because having found someone she loves, mary is terrified that alec will go.",
"these moments – right now, when mary is reluctantly admitting the truth of her history, and alec is just shrugging them off and continuing to love mary – these are the moments where the relationship is growing deeper and less superficial.",
"these are the moments that mary never expected, the moments he never planned for, because i'm pretty sure mary would have been happy to just continue to keep his past hidden if only to ensure that alec never had another reason to abandon her.",
"but now that he's realizing that alec is different and that alec truly loves mary for mary, and that it's okay to be imperfect.",
"mary thought she needed to be perfect to be loved, but alec is proving to be an exception to the norm by loving mary, “faults” and all.",
"It's no secret that Easter, a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, has deep pagan roots.",
"The fact that the holiday isn't tied to a specific date, and is instead governed by the phases of the moon, is strong evidence of its pagan origins.",
"And hot cross buns, the classic Easter treat, is a perfect example of how traditional foods can be repurposed to support new ideas and beliefs.",
"Traditional hot cross buns — a sweetly spiced bread, studded with dried fruit and decorated with a cross made of dough or icing — have historically been served on Good Friday.",
"In 1592, Queen Elizabeth I decided that crossed buns would only be sold on Good Friday, Christmas and at burials.",
"Whether her decree was due to superstition or politics, it eventually turned hot cross buns into the Good Friday treat we enjoy today.",
"But long before that, this popular Christian Easter treat got its start as a pagan spring custom.",
"Templates are to project managers what knives are to professional chefs: indispensable.",
"Much of the power really lies behind the formulas and rules that you can write to manipulate data and information automatically, regardless of what data you insert into the spreadsheet.",

"It's not for every business, though.",

"Think about Youtube and Google. ",
"You might rack up millions of views on Youtube, for example, but Youtube isn't telling you who is watching your videos. ",
"You could have a Facebook page with millions of followers, but only a fraction of your posts are actually seen.",
"The same principle applies to email. ",
"If you send out an email, a lot of it is going to spam. ",
