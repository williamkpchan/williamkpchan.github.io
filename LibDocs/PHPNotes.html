<h2>invoke PHP Interactive shell</h2>
$ php -a

php > echo 5+8;

php > function addTwo($n)
{ return $n + 2;}
echo(addTwo(5));

var_dump(addtwo(2));

The interactive shell also features tab completion for functions, constants, class names, variables, static method calls and class constants.

Example Tab completion

Pressing the tab key twice when there are multiple possible completions will result in a list of these completions:

php > strp[TAB][TAB]
strpbrk   strpos    strptime  

When there is only one possible completion, pressing tab once will complete the rest on the same line:

php > strpt[TAB]ime(

Completion will also work for names that have been defined during the current interactive shell session:

php > $fooThisIsAReallyLongVariableName = 42;
php > $foo[TAB]ThisIsAReallyLongVariableName

The interactive shell stores your history which can be accessed using the up and down keys. 

The history is saved in the ~/.php_history file.

As of PHP 5.4.0, the CLI SAPI provides the php.ini settings cli.pager and cli.prompt. 

The cli.pager setting allows an external program (such as less) to act as a pager for the output instead of being displayed directly on the screen. 

The cli.prompt setting makes it possible to change the php > prompt.

In PHP 5.4.0 it was also made possible to set php.ini settings in the interactive shell using a shorthand notation.

Example #3 Setting php.ini settings in the interactive shell

The cli.prompt setting:

php > #cli.prompt=hello world :> 
hello world :>
Using backticks it is possible to have PHP code executed in the prompt:

php > #cli.prompt=`echo date('H:i:s');` php > 
php > #cli.prompt=php > 

php > sleep(2);

Setting the pager to less:
php > #cli.pager=less
php > phpinfo();
 (output displayed in less)

The cli.prompt setting supports a few escape sequences:

cli.prompt escape sequences
Sequence	Description
\e	Used for adding colors to the prompt. 
     An example could be \e[032m\v \e[031m\b \e[34m\> \e[0m
\v	The PHP version.
\b	Indicates which block PHP is in. 
     For instance /* to indicate being inside a multi-line comment. 
     The outer scope is denoted by php.
\>	Indicates the prompt character. 

By default this is >, but changes when the shell is inside an unterminated block or string. 
Possible characters are: ' " { ( >

Note:
Files included through auto_prepend_file and auto_append_file are parsed in this mode but with some restrictions - e.g. functions have to be defined before called.

<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php" class="whitebut ">PHP commandline</a>

type 'h' or 'help' to see instructions & features

Printing strings:
php> echo 'hi';

Do some math:
php> echo 1+2;

Print some builtin variables:
php> echo $_SERVER;

Print contents of that array:
php> print_r($_SERVER);

Get a key of that array:
php> echo $_SERVER['TERM'];

Addition of a different kind:
php> =2+2

Print the previous:
php> = $_

Store a variable:
php> $msg = "don't just sit there fancy pants, take the wheel";

An equation can be held open through newlines until it completes:
php> =2+
 ... 3+
 ... 4+5

Define our own arrays:
php> $derp = array(1,2,3);
php> echo $derp

Get the type of a variable:
php> echo gettype(PHP_VERSION);

For great justice, loops:
php> $i = 0; while ($i &lt; 3){$i++; echo "pinkie pie is best pony ";}

Get yerself some info:
php> phpinfo();

Explode parses the string on space into an array, print_r pretty prints it:
php> function little_bad_girl(){ print_r(explode(" ", "oxy contin")); }
php> little_bad_girl();

Foreach structure can be extended onto following lines.
php> foreach (array(1,2,3) as $item) {
 ... echo $item;
 ... }

Block comments are ignored:
php> /* echo "hidden"; */

Read from a file:
php> $section = file_get_contents('/home/el/myfile.txt');
php> echo $section;

php> echo time();

Pure sweet truth:
php> echo isset($_SERVER);

Make an array, search for an item in it.
php> $data = array(0, 1, 2);    
php> echo preg_grep("/1/", $data);
php> print_r( preg_grep("/1/", $data));
php> print_r( preg_grep("/4/", $data));

<h2>explode function split string by delimiter (comma, space, tab etc) </h2>
The PHP explode function splits a string by a delimiter string. 
It is the opposite of implode.

&lt;?php
// split by comma
$colors = "red,green,blue";
var_dump(explode(",", $colors));

$thedict = (explode(",", $colors));
echo $thedict[2];

// split by comma-space
$colors = "red, green, blue";
var_dump(explode(", ", $colors));

// split by space - extra space yields extra elements
$colors = "red green   blue";
var_dump(explode(" ", $colors));

// split by comma
$colors = "red	green	blue";
var_dump(explode("\t", $colors));
?>

<h2>Execute PHP Online</h2>

<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_php_online.php">Execute PHP Online</a>

<h2>Basic PHP</h2>

<a href="PHP Examples.html" target="_blank"><span class="redb">♦PHP Examples</span></a>

A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.
A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:

&lt;?php
// PHP code goes here
?&gt;
The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".

In PHP, all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.
However; all variable names ARE case-sensitive.

Comments:
// This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines
*/
// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;

In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;

The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.

A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:
The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.

The static Keyword:
Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.
To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:

Example

&lt;?php
function myTest() {
    static $x = 0;
    echo $x;
    $x++;
}
myTest();  //0
myTest();  //1
myTest();  //2
?&gt;

<h2>Database Queries</h2>
A query is a question or a request.

SELECT LastName FROM Employees
The query above selects all the data in the "LastName" column from the "Employees" table.

PHP 5 and later can work with a MySQL database using:
MySQLi extension (the "i" stands for improved)
PDO (PHP Data Objects)

PHP Connect to MySQL
Before we can access data in the MySQL database, we need to be able to connect to the server:

&lt;?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
} 
echo "Connected successfully";
?&gt;

<br>
<h2>=> is the separator for associative arrays</h2>

The double arrow operator, =>, is used as an access mechanism for arrays. 
This can be used to set values of any acceptable type into a corresponding index of an array. 
The index can be associative (string based) or numeric.

$myArray = array(
    0 => 'Big',
    1 => 'Small',
    2 => 'Up',
    3 => 'Down'
);

=> is used in associative array key value assignment.

The object operator, ->, is used in object scope to access methods and properties of an object. 
It’s meaning is to say that what is on the right of the operator is a member of the object instantiated into the variable on the left side of the operator. 

-> is used to access an object method or property. 
Example: $obj->method().

Instantiated is the key term here.

// Create a new instance of MyObject into $obj
$obj = new MyObject();
// Set a property in the $obj object called thisProperty
$obj->thisProperty = 'Fred';
// Call a method of the $obj object named getProperty
$obj->getProperty();

Example:

$user_list = array(
    'dave' => 'apassword',
    'steve' => 'secr3t'
);

foreach ($user_list as $user => $pass) {
    echo "{$user}'s pass is: {$pass}\n";
}

PHP Associative Arrays
In an associative array, we can associate any key with each value.
$prices = array( 'Tires'=>100, 'Oil'=>10, 'Spark Plugs'=>4 );

There are two ways to create an associative array: 
$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
or:
$age['Peter'] = "35";
$age['Ben'] = "37";
$age['Joe'] = "43";

<b class="red">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</b> provides a very easy way to find, extract and modify the HTML elements of the dom. 

// Create DOM from URL or file
$html = file_get_html('http://www.google.com/');

// Find all images
foreach($html->find('img') as $element)
       echo $element->src . '&lt;br>';

// Find all links
foreach($html->find('a') as $element)
       echo $element->href . '&lt;br>';

<b class="cyanword">file_get_contents</b> will load the response body into a string but 
<b class="cyanword">file_get_html</b> will load it into simple-html-dom

$dom = file_get_html($url);
$tables = $dom->find('table');
echo $tables[0];
echo $tables[1];

Alternatively you could use file_get_contents along with str_get_html:
$dom = str_get_html(file_get_contents($url));
But that would be silly.


Use simple_html_dom
example

&lt;?php
require 'simple_html_dom.php';

$html = file_get_html('http://www.google.com/');
$title = $html-&gt;find('title', 0);
$image = $html-&gt;find('img', 0);

echo $title-&gt;plaintext."&lt;br&gt;\n";
echo $image-&gt;src;
?&gt;

Second example, without an external library
note that using regex on HTML is NOT a good idea.

&lt;?php
$data = file_get_contents('http://www.google.com/');

preg_match('/&lt;title&gt;([^&lt;]+)&lt;\/title&gt;/i', $data, $matches);
$title = $matches[1];

preg_match('/&lt;img[^&gt;]*src=[\'"]([^\'"]+)[\'"][^&gt;]*&gt;/i', $data, $matches);
$img = $matches[1];

echo $title."&lt;br&gt;\n";
echo $img;
?&gt;

<h2>access php variables in javascript or jquery</h2>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1808108/how-to-access-php-variables-in-javascript-or-jquery-rather-than-php-echo-vari">access php variables in javascript or jquery</a>

the most simple way of passing PHP variables to JavaScript,
can also use json_encode for more complex things like arrays:

&lt;?php
    $simple = 'simple string';
    $complex = array('more', 'complex', 'object', array('foo', 'bar'));
?&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    var simple = '&lt;?php echo $simple; ?&gt;';
    var complex = &lt;?php echo json_encode($complex); ?&gt;;
&lt;/script&gt;

Other than that, if you really want to "interact" between PHP and JavaScript you should use Ajax.

Using cookies for this is a very unsafe and unreliable way, as they are stored clientside and therefore open for any manipulation or won't even get accepted/saved. 
Don't use them for this type of interaction. 
jQuery.ajax is a good start.

If AJAX isn't an option you can use nested data structures to simplify.
&lt;?php
$var = array(
    'qwe' =&gt; 'asd',
    'asd' =&gt; array(
        1 =&gt; 2,
        3 =&gt; 4,
    ),
    'zxc' =&gt; 0,
);
?&gt;
&lt;script&gt;var data = &lt;?php echo json_encode($var); ?&gt;;&lt;/script&gt;


alert('&lt;?php echo($phpvariable); ?&gt;');
echo() ing them directly into the Javascript source code is the most reliable and downward compatible way.

<h2>php regular expressions</h2>
<a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-regular-expressions.php">php regular expressions</a>

&lt;?php
// Returns true if "abc" is found anywhere in $string.

ereg("^abc", $string);

// Returns true if "abc" is found at the end of $string.
ereg("abc$", $string);

// Returns true if client browser is Netscape 2, 3 or MSIE 3.
eregi("(ozilla.[23]|MSIE.3)", $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]);

ereg("([[:alnum:]]+) ([[:alnum:]]+) ([[:alnum:]]+)", $string, $regs); 

&// Put a lt;br /&gt; tag at the beginning of $string.
&$string = ereg_replace("^", "lt;br /&gt;", $string); 

&// Put a lt;br /&gt; tag at the end of $string.

<h2>JavaScript cannot call the PHP function, even from Ajax. </h2>
What Ajax does, is ask for data that is outputted from a PHP file. 
Ajax will only fetch the string that was printed from PHP.

=========
Client side do something like

<h2>bind ajax call on your button click</h2>
when the button click it will trigger the ajax call.
=======
$(document).ready(function()
{
// when button click it will trigger ajax call
 $("#button").click(function(){
     $.ajax({
         type: "GET",
         url: "name.php",
         data: { name: "John" },
         success: function(data) {
            // on successfull return it will alert the data 
            alert("Data saved: " + data);
         }    
      });
  });
});
&lt;input type="button" id="button" value="Click me"&gt;

data will contain all the string that was printed from your PHP file. 
If you expect an array, you need to convert it into a JSON.

=======
And in your name.php
====
 &lt;?php
    // get your data you send from ajax 
   $name = $_GET['name'];
   // it will echo the "hello $name" and return it
   greet($name);

   function greet($name)
   {
     echo "hello $name";
   }

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

There are two HTTP request methods: GET and POST

GET – Requests data from a specified resource.
POST – Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.

The GET Method
====
In GET method the data is sent as URL parameters that are usually strings of name and value pairs separated by ampersands (&). 
In general, a URL with GET data will look like this:

Example :
http://www.example.com/action.php?name=Sam&weight=55

More than one parameter=value can be embedded in the URL by concatenating with ampersands (&).

One can only send simple text data via GET method.

&lt;?php
   if( $_GET["name"] || $_GET["weight"] ) { 
      echo "Welcome ". $_GET['weight']. "&lt;br /&gt;"; 
      echo "You are ". $_GET['weight']. " kgs in weight."; 
      exit(); 
   } 
?&gt; 

&lt;html&gt; 
   &lt;body&gt; 
      &lt;form action = "&lt;?php $_PHP_SELF ?&gt;" method = "GET"&gt; 
         Name: &lt;input type = "text" name = "name" /&gt; 
         Weight: &lt;input type = "text" name = "weight" /&gt; 
         &lt;input type = "submit" /&gt; 
      &lt;/form&gt; 
   &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt; 

Advantages of Using the GET Method

Since the data sent by the GET method are displayed in the URL, it is possible to bookmark the page with specific query string values.
GET requests can be cached and GET requests remain in the browser history.
GET requests can be bookmarked.

Disadvantages of Using the GET Method

The GET method is not suitable for passing sensitive information such as the username and password, because these are fully visible in the URL query string as well as potentially stored in the client browser’s memory as a visited page.
Because the GET method assigns data to a server environment variable, the length of the URL is limited. So, there is a limitation for the total data to be sent.

The POST Method
====
In POST method the data is sent to the server as a package in a separate communication with the processing script. 
Data sent through POST method will not be visible in the URL.

EXAMPLE :
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: gfs.com
SAM=451&MAT=62

&lt;?php
   if( $_POST["name"] || $_POST["weight"] ) { 
      if (preg_match("/[^A-Za-z'-]/",$_POST['name'] )) { 
         die ("invalid name and name should be alpha"); 
      } 
      echo "Welcome ". $_POST['name']. "&lt;br /&gt;"; 
      echo "You are ". $_POST['weight']. "kgs in weight."; 
      exit(); 
   } 
?&gt; 

&lt;html&gt; 
   &lt;body&gt;    
      &lt;form action = "&lt;?php $_PHP_SELF ?&gt;" method = "POST"&gt; 
         Name: &lt;input type = "text" name = "name" /&gt; 
         Weight: &lt;input type = "text" name = "weight" /&gt; 
         &lt;input type = "submit" /&gt; 
      &lt;/form&gt; 
   &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt; 

Advantages of using POST Method

It is more secure than GET because user-entered information is never visible in the URL query string or in the server logs.
There is a much larger limit on the amount of data that can be passed and one can send text data as well as binary data (uploading a file) using POST.

Disadvantages of using the POST Method

Since the data sent by the POST method is not visible in the URL, so it is not possible to bookmark the page with specific query.
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history.

<h2>Execute PHP function with onclick</h2>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19323010/execute-php-function-with-onclick">Execute PHP function with onclick</a>

&lt;a role="button" href="?action=removeday" class="debatebtn">Delete&lt;/a>
where the action is caught and runs the removeday() function similar to if($action == 'removeday'){ removeday(); }.

function removeday() { ... }

PHP: It only runs by the server and responds to requests like clicking on a link (GET) or submitting a form (POST).

HTML & JavaScript: It only runs in someone's browser (excluding NodeJS).

&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
&lt;html>
&lt;?php
  function runMyFunction() { echo 'I just ran a php function'; }

  if (isset($_GET['hello'])) { runMyFunction(); }
?>

Hello there!
&lt;a href='index.php?hello=true'>Run PHP Function&lt;/a>
&lt;/html>


The myfnc() exists on the server-side and is to be executed on the server-side only, it will not appear on the client-side, you have to submit the form to the server and call the function over there, try this:

&lt;?php
if (isset($_POST['submit'])){ myfnc();}

function myfnc(){echo "Hello world" ;}
?>

&lt;form action="trytocallfunction.php" method="post">
&lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit">
&lt;/form>
If you don't want to refresh the page, you can make a request to PHP without refreshing via a method called Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX).

PHP only responds to requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE via $_REQUEST), this is how you have to run a PHP function even though they're in the same file.


In javascript, make an ajax function,

function myAjax() {
      $.ajax({
           type: "POST",
           url: 'your_url/ajax.php',
           data:{action:'call_this'},
           success:function(html) {
             alert(html);
           }
      });
 }
Then call from html,
&lt;a href="" onclick="myAjax()" class="deletebtn">Delete&lt;/a>

And in your ajax.php,
if($_POST['action'] == 'call_this') {
  // call removeday() here
}

<h2>PHP web scraping</h2>
I recommend you consider simple_html_dom for this. 
It will make it very easy.

Here is a working example of how to pull the title, and first image.

&lt?php
require 'simple_html_dom.php';

$html = file_get_html('http://www.google.com/');
$title = $html->find('title', 0);
$image = $html->find('img', 0);

echo $title->plaintext."&ltbr>\n";
echo $image->src;
?>

Here is a second example that will do the same without an external library. 
I should note that using regex on HTML is NOT a good idea.

&lt?php
$data = file_get_contents('http://www.google.com/');

preg_match('/&lttitle>([^&lt]+)&lt\/title>/i', $data, $matches);
$title = $matches[1];

preg_match('/&ltimg[^>]*src=[\'"]([^\'"]+)[\'"][^>]*>/i', $data, $matches);
$img = $matches[1];

echo $title."&ltbr>\n";
echo $img;
?>

<h2>PHP Open File - fopen()</h2>
Example
&lt;?php
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
echo fread($myfile,filesize("webdictionary.txt"));
fclose($myfile);
?>
Tip: The fread() and the fclose() functions will be explained below.

The file may be opened in one of the following modes:

Modes	Description
r	Open a file for read only. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
w	Open a file for write only. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
a	Open a file for write only. The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist
x	Creates a new file for write only. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists
r+	Open a file for read/write. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
w+	Open a file for read/write. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
a+	Open a file for read/write. The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist
x+	Creates a new file for read/write. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists

<h2>PHP Read File - fread()</h2>
The fread() function reads from an open file.

The first parameter of fread() contains the name of the file to read from and the second parameter specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.

The following PHP code reads the "webdictionary.txt" file to the end:

fread($myfile,filesize("webdictionary.txt"));

<h2>PHP Close File - fclose()</h2>
The fclose() function is used to close an open file.

It's a good programming practice to close all files after you have finished with them. You don't want an open file running around on your server taking up resources!

The fclose() requires the name of the file (or a variable that holds the filename) we want to close:

&lt;?php
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r");
// some code to be executed....
fclose($myfile);
?>

<h2>PHP Read Single Line - fgets()</h2>
The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.

The example below outputs the first line of the "webdictionary.txt" file:

Example
&lt;?php
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
echo fgets($myfile);
fclose($myfile);
?>
Note: After a call to the fgets() function, the file pointer has moved to the next line.

<h2>PHP Check End-Of-File - feof()</h2>
The feof() function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached.

The feof() function is useful for looping through data of unknown length.

The example below reads the "webdictionary.txt" file line by line, until end-of-file is reached:

Example
&lt;?php
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
// Output one line until end-of-file
while(!feof($myfile)) {
  echo fgets($myfile) . "&lt;br>";
}
fclose($myfile);
?>

<h2>PHP Read Single Character - fgetc()</h2>
The fgetc() function is used to read a single character from a file.

The example below reads the "webdictionary.txt" file character by character, until end-of-file is reached:

Example
&lt;?php
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
// Output one character until end-of-file
while(!feof($myfile)) {
  echo fgetc($myfile);
}
fclose($myfile);
?>
Note: After a call to the fgetc() function, the file pointer moves to the next character.

<h2>PHP readfile() Function</h2>
Example
Read a file:

&lt;?php
echo readfile("test.txt");
?>
Definition and Usage
The readfile() function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.

Tip: You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled in the php.ini file.

Syntax
readfile(file, include_path, context)
Parameter Values
Parameter	Description
file	Required. Specifies the file to read
include_path	Optional. Set this parameter to TRUE if you want to search for the file in the include_path (in php.ini) as well
context	Optional. Specifies the context of the file handle. Context is a set of options that can modify the behavior of a stream

<h2>PHP file_get_contents() Function</h2>
<?php
$homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
echo $homepage;

echo nl2br( file_get_contents('risingList.txt') );
?>

<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-split.php">preg_split()</a> - Split string by a regular expression
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-split.php">str_split()</a> - Convert a string to an array
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mb-split.php">mb_split()</a> - Split multibyte string using regular expression
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-word-count.php">str_word_count()</a> - Return information about words used in a string

<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.implode.php">implode()</a> - Join array elements with a string

<h2>PHP get user input</h2>
You can't take input in the middle of php execution since it finishes before the page is actually shown to the user. 
However, you can get input using HTML and receive that using php. 
Here's a really basic example:

&lt;?php
    echo $_POST['value'];
?>
&lt;form method="post" action="">
&lt;input type="text" name="value">
&lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>
It takes the user input and reloads the page. 
Then, it echoes what the input was.

<h2>two-dimensional array</h2>

$cars = array
  (
  array("Volvo",22,18),
  array("BMW",15,13),
  array("Saab",5,2),
  array("Land Rover",17,15)
  );

echo $cars[0][0].": In stock: ".$cars[0][1].", sold: ".$cars[0][2];
echo $cars[1][0].": In stock: ".$cars[1][1].", sold: ".$cars[1][2];
echo $cars[2][0].": In stock: ".$cars[2][1].", sold: ".$cars[2][2];
echo $cars[3][0].": In stock: ".$cars[3][1].", sold: ".$cars[3][2];

for ($row = 0; $row < 4; $row++) {
  echo "Row number $row ";
  echo "&lt;ul>";
  for ($col = 0; $col < 3; $col++) {
    echo "<li>".$cars[$row][$col]."</li>";
  }

echo gettype($data)

echo count($data);
echo sizeof($data);
print_r($data[1]);

If you send a PHP array into a function that expects a string like: echo or print, then the PHP interpreter will convert your array to the literal string Array, throw this Notice and keep going. For example:

php> print(array(1,2,3))

In this case, the function print dumps the literal string: Array to stdout and then logs the Notice to stderr and keeps going.

when you echo an array, all it does is print Array and a notice.
To print properly an array, you either loop through it and echo each element, or you can use print_r.

Use json_encode to collapse the array to json string:
$stuff = array(1,2,3);
print json_encode($stuff);   //Prints [1,2,3]

Joining all the cells in the array together:
    $stuff = array(1,2,3);
    print implode(", ", $stuff);    //prints 1, 2, 3
    print join(',', $stuff);        //prints 1, 2, 3

suppress the Notices:
error_reporting(0);
print(array(1,2,3));    //Prints 'Array' without a Notice.

<h2>isset() Determine if a variable is declared and is different than NULL</h2>

$var = '';
// This will evaluate to TRUE so the text will be printed.
if (isset($var)) { echo "This var is set so I will print.";}

// this time use var_dump to output the return value of isset().
$a = "test";
$b = "anothertest";

var_dump(isset($a));      // TRUE
var_dump(isset($a, $b)); // TRUE

unset ($a);

var_dump(isset($a));     // FALSE
var_dump(isset($a, $b)); // FALSE

$foo = NULL;
var_dump(isset($foo));   // FALSE

If a variable has been unset with the unset() function, it is no longer considered to be set.

<h2>PHP $_POST</h2>
PHP $_POST is a PHP super global variable which is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="post". 
$_POST is also widely used to pass variables.

&lt;form method="post" action="&lt;?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];?>">
  Name: &lt;input type="text" name="fname">
  &lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>

&lt;?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // collect value of input field
    $name = $_POST['fname'];
    if (empty($name)) {
        echo "Name is empty";
    } else {
        echo $name;
    }
}
?>

When a user submits the data by clicking on "Submit", the form data is sent to the file specified in the action attribute of the &lt;form> tag. 
In this example, we point to the file itself for processing form data. 
If you wish to use another PHP file to process form data, replace that with the filename of your choice. 
Then, we can use the super global variable $_POST to collect the value of the

m - Represents a month (01 to 12)
Y - Represents a year (in four digits)
l (lowercase 'L') - Represents the day of the week
Other characters, like"/", ".", or "-" can also be inserted between the characters to add additional formatting.

echo "Today is " . date("Y/m/d") . "<br>";
echo "Today is " . date("Y.m.d") . "<br>";
echo "Today is " . date("Y-m-d") . "<br>";
echo "Today is " . date("l");

<h2>Automatic Copyright Year</h2>
Use the date() function to automatically update the copyright year on your website:
&copy; 2010-<?php echo date("Y");?>

<h2>Get a Time</h2>
H - 24-hour format of an hour (00 to 23)
h - 12-hour format of an hour with leading zeros (01 to 12)
i - Minutes with leading zeros (00 to 59)
s - Seconds with leading zeros (00 to 59)
a - Lowercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem (am or pm)
echo "The time is " . date("h:i:sa");

Get Your Time Zone
date_default_timezone_set("America/New_York");
echo "The time is " . date("h:i:sa");

Create a Date With mktime()
mktime(hour, minute, second, month, day, year)

$d=mktime(11, 14, 54, 8, 12, 2014);
echo "Created date is " . date("Y-m-d h:i:sa", $d);

Create a Date From a String With strtotime()
$d=strtotime("10:30pm April 15 2014");
echo "Created date is " . date("Y-m-d h:i:sa", $d);

The example below outputs the dates for the next six Saturdays:
$startdate = strtotime("Saturday");
$enddate = strtotime("+6 weeks", $startdate);

while ($startdate < $enddate) {
  echo date("M d", $startdate) . "<br>";
  $startdate = strtotime("+1 week", $startdate);
}

The example below outputs the number of days until 4th of July:
$d1=strtotime("July 04");
$d2=ceil(($d1-time())/60/60/24);
echo "There are " . $d2 ." days until 4th of July.";

<h2>PHP include and require Statements</h2>
require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue

The require statement is also used to include a file into the PHP code.
However, there is one big difference between include and require; 
when a file is included with the include statement and PHP cannot find it, the script will continue to execute

If we do the same example using the require statement, the echo statement will not be executed because the script execution dies after the require statement returned a fatal error:

&lt;?php include 'footer.php';?>

Use require when the file is required by the application.
Use include when the file is not required and application should continue when file is not found.

<h2>PHP Manipulating Files</h2>
PHP readfile() Function
The readfile() function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.

echo readfile("webdictionary.txt");

PHP Open File - fopen()
This function gives you more options than the readfile() function.

$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
echo fread($myfile,filesize("webdictionary.txt"));
fclose($myfile);

The file may be opened in one of the following modes:

Modes	Description
r	Open a file for read only. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
w	Open a file for write only. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
a	Open a file for write only. The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist
x	Creates a new file for write only. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists
r+	Open a file for read/write. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
w+	Open a file for read/write. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file
a+	Open a file for read/write. The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist
x+	Creates a new file for read/write. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists

<h2>PHP Read File - fread()</h2>
The fread() function reads from an open file.

The first parameter of fread() contains the name of the file to read from and the second parameter specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.

fread($myfile,filesize("webdictionary.txt"));

<h2>PHP Close File - fclose()</h2>
The fclose() function is used to close an open file.

PHP Read Single Line - fgets()
The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
echo fgets($myfile);
fclose($myfile);

PHP Check End-Of-File - feof()
The feof() function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached.
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
// Output one line until end-of-file
while(!feof($myfile)) {
  echo fgets($myfile) . "<br>";
}
fclose($myfile);

<h2>PHP Read Single Character - fgetc()</h2>
The fgetc() function is used to read a single character from a file.
$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
// Output one character until end-of-file
while(!feof($myfile)) {
  echo fgetc($myfile);
}
fclose($myfile);

<h2>PHP Create File - fopen()</h2>
The fopen() function is also used to create a file. Maybe a little confusing, but in PHP, a file is created using the same function used to open files.
If you use fopen() on a file that does not exist, it will create it, given that the file is opened for writing (w) or appending (a).

$myfile = fopen("testfile.txt", "w")

<h2>PHP File Permissions</h2>
If you are having errors when trying to get this code to run, check that you have granted your PHP file access to write information to the hard drive.

PHP Write to File - fwrite()
The fwrite() function is used to write to a file.

The first parameter of fwrite() contains the name of the file to write to and the second parameter is the string to be written.

$myfile = fopen("newfile.txt", "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
$txt = "John Doe\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
$txt = "Jane Doe\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
fclose($myfile);

PHP Overwriting
Now that "newfile.txt" contains some data we can show what happens when we open an existing file for writing. All the existing data will be ERASED and we start with an empty file.

$myfile = fopen("newfile.txt", "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
$txt = "Mickey Mouse\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
$txt = "Minnie Mouse\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
fclose($myfile);

<h2>PHP File Upload</h2>
Configure The "php.ini" File
First, ensure that PHP is configured to allow file uploads.

In your "php.ini" file, search for the file_uploads directive, and set it to On:
file_uploads = On

<h2>Create The HTML Form</h2>
&lt;form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Select image to upload:
    &lt;input type="file" name="fileToUpload" id="fileToUpload">
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload Image" name="submit">
&lt;/form>

Some rules to follow for the HTML form above:

Make sure that the form uses method="post"
The form also needs the following attribute: enctype="multipart/form-data". 
It specifies which content-type to use when submitting the form
Without the requirements above, the file upload will not work.

Other things to notice:
The type="file" attribute of the &lt;input> tag shows the input field as a file-select control, with a "Browse" button next to the input control
The form above sends data to a file called "upload.php", which we will create next.

Create The Upload File PHP Script
The "upload.php" file contains the code for uploading a file:
&lt;?php
$target_dir = "uploads/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
$uploadOk = 1;
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
// Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
if(isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $check = getimagesize($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"]);
    if($check !== false) {
        echo "File is an image - " . $check["mime"] . ".";
        $uploadOk = 1;
    } else {
        echo "File is not an image.";
        $uploadOk = 0;
    }
}
?>
$target_dir = "uploads/" - specifies the directory where the file is going to be placed
$target_file specifies the path of the file to be uploaded
$uploadOk=1 is not used yet (will be used later)
$imageFileType holds the file extension of the file (in lower case)
Next, check if the image file is an actual image or a fake image

Check if File Already Exists
Now we can add some restrictions.

First, we will check if the file already exists in the "uploads" folder. If it does, an error message is displayed, and $uploadOk is set to 0:

// Check if file already exists
if (file_exists($target_file)) {
    echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

Limit File Size
The file input field in our HTML form above is named "fileToUpload".

Now, we want to check the size of the file. If the file is larger than 500KB, an error message is displayed, and $uploadOk is set to 0:

// Check file size
if ($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["size"] > 500000) {
    echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

Limit File Type
The code below only allows users to upload JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF files. All other file types gives an error message before setting $uploadOk to 0:

// Allow certain file formats
if($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg"
&& $imageFileType != "gif" ) {
    echo "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

<h2>Complete Upload File PHP Script</h2>
The complete "upload.php" file now looks like this:

&lt;?php
$target_dir = "uploads/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
$uploadOk = 1;
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
// Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
if(isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $check = getimagesize($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"]);
    if($check !== false) {
        echo "File is an image - " . $check["mime"] . ".";
        $uploadOk = 1;
    } else {
        echo "File is not an image.";
        $uploadOk = 0;
    }
}
// Check if file already exists
if (file_exists($target_file)) {
    echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}
// Check file size
if ($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["size"] > 500000) {
    echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}
// Allow certain file formats
if($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg"
&& $imageFileType != "gif" ) {
    echo "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}
// Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
if ($uploadOk == 0) {
    echo "Sorry, your file was not uploaded.";
// if everything is ok, try to upload file
} else {
    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
        echo "The file ". basename( $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]). " has been uploaded.";
    } else {
        echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
    }
}
?>

<h2>ob_start()</h2>
Think of ob_start() as saying "Start remembering everything that would normally be outputted, but don't quite do anything with it yet."

PHP is an interpreted language thus each statement is executed one after another, therefore PHP tends to send HTML to browsers in chunks thus reducing performance. Using output buffering the generated HTML gets stored in a buffer or a string variable and is sent to the buffer to render after the execution of the last statement in the PHP script.

But Output Buffering is not enabled by default. In order to enable the Output Buffering one must use the ob_start() function before any echoing any HTML content in a script.


For example:
ob_start();
echo("Hello there!"); //would normally get printed to the screen/output to browser
$output = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();

There are two other functions you typically pair it with: 
ob_get_contents(), which basically gives you whatever has been "saved" to the buffer since it was turned on with ob_start(), and then 
ob_end_clean() or ob_flush(), which either stops saving things and discards whatever was saved, or stops saving and outputs it all at once, respectively.

For example:
&lt;?php 
// PHP code to illustrate the working of ob_start() Function  
  function callback($buffer){   // Return Everything in CAPS. 
    return (strtoupper($buffer)); 
} 
  
ob_start("callback"); 
echo "Hello Geek!"; 
ob_end_flush(); 
?> 

<h2>Web Scraping with PHP</h2>
<h3>Web Scraping Techniques</h3>
<strong>DOM Parsing</strong>

With the help of web browsers, programs can access the dynamic content that the client-side scripts have created. 
One can parse web pages in the form of a DOM (Document Object Model) tree which is in a way a description of which programs can get access to which parts of the pages. 
To give you an example, an HTML or XML document is converted to DOM. 
What DOM does is that it articulates the structure of documents and how a document can be accessed. 
PHP provides DOM extension.

<strong>Regular Expressions</strong>

In this case, you define a pattern (or say “regular expressions”) that you want to match in a text string and then search in the text string for matches. 
It is used a lot in search engines. 
When one is exploring string information, regular expressions come into play. 
Regular expressions are a basic tool and can take care of your elementary needs.

<h3>Web Scraping Using PHP</h3>
We will explore some PHP libraries which can be used to understand how to use the HTTP protocol as far as our PHP code is concerned, how we can steer clear of the built-in API wrappers and in its place, think of using something that is way more simple and easy to manage for web scraping.

What we will try to do here is to write a straightforward scraper with the help of Simple HTML DOM library. 
It will be possible for you to see how to scrape the data you want using PHP and how the extracted data can be converted into xml file with the help of SimpleXMLElement library as shown below:

1. Simple HTML DOM
An HTML DOM parser which is written is PHP5+ is useful because it allows you to access and use HTML in a convenient and comfortable way.
It is PHP5+ compatible.
It supports invalid HTML.
You can use it to identify tags on a given HTML page with the help of selectors like jQuery.
You can get the contents from HTML with a simple single line of code.

2. SimpleXMLElement
SimpleXMLElement stands for an element in an XML document.
It is nothing but just an extension that enables you to get XML data.
What it does is that it converts an XML document into a data structure. 
It means that you can access and use it like a data structure.

<h4>1. How to install Simple HTML Dom Parser:</h4>
To start with, download Simple HTML Dom Parser from this <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LINK</a>.

Next, extract zip file Simplehtmldom_1_5.zip and what you will have is a folder called &#8220;simple_dom&#8221;.

<h4>2. How to Scrape data from website using PHP with Simple HTML DOM</h4>
Now we come to the application part of the process. 
Let’s get down to scraping the IMDB website to extract the review of the movie “Avengers: Infinity War”. 
You can get it here.

<h3>Step 1: Create a new PHP file called scraper.php and include the library mentioned below:</h3>
<span style="color: #384;">&lt;?php</span><br />
<span style="color: #384;">require_once &#8216;simple_html_dom.php&#8217;;</span>

To create a new PHP file, create a new folder called “simple_dom” and include “simple_html_dom.php” file at the top.

Why movie reviews and rating matter is because these can be used to create the necessary database for sentiment analysis, text classification etc.

Since there are countless reviews in a website like IMDB, it is not possible to get all the reviews by mere copy-paste.

With the help of web scraping, you can get all the reviews in an automatic fashion and save it in xml file.

Now, we will extract the following data from the website:
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rating stars &#8211; The users’ rating stars of the film.<br />
</span>
<span style="color: #384;">Title of reviews &#8211; The title of the users’ review.</span>
<span style="color: #008000;">Review &#8211; The content of the review.</span>

Here’s how all these fields are arranged. 
Take a look at the screenshot:

<img src="https://prowebscraper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/review_screenshot_1.png">

<h3>Step 2: Extract the html returned content from the website.</h3>
What you need to do is use file_get_html function to get HTML page of the URL.

URL = <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt</a> .

<span style="color: #384;">&lt;?php</span><br />
<span style="color: #384;">require_once &#8216;simple_html_dom.php&#8217;;</span><br />
<span style="color: #384;">//get html content from the site.</span><br />
<span style="color: #384;">$dom = file_get_html(&#8216;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_3</a>&#8216;, false);</span>

<h3>Step 3: Scrape the fields of the reviews</h3>
Now the fun starts. 
We will make use of the HTML tag and scrape the data items mentioned earlier, like rating stars, title of the review and reviews with the help of Inspect element.

This is how you can find out the class of the tag with the help of following step:

<strong>Go to chrome browser => Open <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> url => do right click => inspect element</strong>

NOTE: If you don’t use chrome browser, go through this <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/get-inspect-element-tool-for-browser-756549" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">article</a>

Next, we will scrape the requisite information from HTML based on css selectors like class, id etc. 
Now let’s get the css class for title, reviews and rating stars. 
All you got to do is right click on title and select “Inspect” or “Inspect Element”.

<img src="https://prowebscraper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/review_screenshot_2.png">

As you can see, the css class “review-container” is applied to all &lt;div> tags which contain titles, rating stars and reviews of users. 
This will be useful in the process of filtering the field from the rest of the other content in the response object:

Next, we will scrape all those fields with the help of that class and a for each loop, as is shown below:

<span style="color: #384;">//collect all user’s reviews into an array</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$answer = array();</span>
<span style="color: #384;">if(!empty($dom)) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$divClass = $title = &#8221;;$i = 0;</span>
<span style="color: #384;">foreach($dom->find(&#8220;.review-container&#8221;) as $divClass) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">//title</span>
<span style="color: #384;">foreach($divClass->find(&#8220;.title&#8221;) as $title ) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$answer[$i][&#8216;title&#8217;] = $title->plaintext;</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">//ipl-ratings-bar</span>
<span style="color: #384;">foreach($divClass->find(&#8220;.ipl-ratings-bar&#8221;) as $ipl_ratings_bar ) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$answer[$i][&#8216;rate&#8217;] = trim($ipl_ratings_bar->plaintext);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">//content</span>
<span style="color: #384;">foreach($divClass->find(&#8216;div[class=text show-more__control]&#8217;) as $desc) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$text = html_entity_decode($desc->plaintext);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$text = preg_replace(&#8216;/\&amp;#39;/&#8217;, &#8220;&#8216;&#8221;, $text);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$answer[$i][&#8216;content&#8217;] = html_entity_decode($text);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$i++;</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">print_r($answer); exit;</span>
I used for each loop to get all the data I want and save it to “$answer” array.
Next, I will print that array and review the output.
<h4>Output:</h4>
As you can observe in the screenshot, we could scrape the title (title of review), rate (rating stars) and content (reviews) in array.

<img src="https://prowebscraper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/content_screenshot.png">
<h3>Step 4: Store data into xml file using “SimpleXMLElement”</h3>
The next step is to store the output in an xml file. 
So all we need to do is to convert “$answer” array into xml element.
In order to do that, we will make use of “SimpleXMLElement” built-in class to convert PHP array into xml element.
<span style="color: #384;">//function definition to convert array to xml</span>
<span style="color: #384;">function array_to_xml($array, &amp;$xml_user_info) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">foreach($array as $key => $value) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">if(is_array($value)) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$subnode = $xml_user_info->addChild(&#8220;Review$key&#8221;);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">foreach ($value as $k=>$v) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$xml_user_info->addChild(&#8220;$k&#8221;, $v);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}else {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$xml_user_info->addChild(&#8220;$key&#8221;,htmlspecialchars(&#8220;$value&#8221;));</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">return $xml_user_info->asXML();</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">//creating object of SimpleXMLElement</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$xml_user_info = new SimpleXMLElement(&#8220;&lt;?xml version=\&#8221;1.0\&#8221;?>&lt;root>&lt;/root>&#8221;);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">//function call to convert array to xml and return whole xml content with tag</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$xmlContent = array_to_xml($answer,$xml_user_info);</span>
⦁ We created an object of SimpleXMLElement and then placed that object into a user defined function called “array_to_xml”.
“$xml_user_info” = It is an object of SimpleXMLElement
“array_to_xml” = It is a user defined function
“$xmlContent” = It is a variable where the data is stored in array format

<h3>Step 5: Create an xml file and write xml content to xml file</h3>

Next I created a file called “AvengersMovieReview.xml” and stored “$xmlContent” into this file.
<span style="color: #384;">// Create a xml file</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$my_file = &#8216;AvengersMovieReview.xml&#8217;;</span>
<span style="color: #384;">$handle = fopen($my_file, &#8216;w&#8217;) or die(&#8216;Cannot open file: &#8216;.$my_file);</span>
<span style="color: #384;">//success and error message based on xml creation</span>
<span style="color: #384;">if(fwrite($handle, $xmlContent)) {</span>
<span style="color: #384;">echo &#8216;XML file have been generated successfully.&#8217;;</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">else{</span>
<span style="color: #384;">echo &#8216;XML file generation error.&#8217;;</span>
<span style="color: #384;">}</span>
<span style="color: #384;">?></span>
At the end of it all, run the whole code and review the output and created xml file <strong>AvengersMovieReview.xml.</strong>
See the screenshot of the output and that is the file.

And we completed scraping the data that we needed. 
Wasn’t it easy to scrape the web data using PHP?

The last bit that you should know: here’s the explanation for Linux basis regarding how to schedule and run this task in the background at regular breaks and in an automatic fashion with the help of Crontab command.

<h3>Automating Script Using Crontab</h3>
As you would know, Linux server can help you in automatize certain functions and completing the tasks which otherwise require human intervention. 
As far as Linux servers are concerned, cron utility is something that people prefer in order to automate the way scripts run. 
For your needs of large data on a daily basis, it can be useful.

Cron is something works well on Linux and Unix environments that take care of scheduled commands which are also called cron jobs configured by the crontab command.

As regards a Linux pc, you can use this script to run it at a specified time of the day with the help of the command “crontab-e”.

<h2>Socket Programming in PHP</h2>

Sockets are used for interprocess communication. 
Interprocess communication is generally based on client-server model. 
In this case, client-server are the applications that interact with each other. 
Interaction between client and server requires a connection. 
Socket programming is responsible for establishing that connection between applications to interact.

<h3>Using the Code</h3>
<strong>Aim</strong>: Develop a client to send a <code>string </code>message to server and server to return reverse of the same message to client.

<h3>PHP SERVER</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Set variables such as "host" and "port"</h4>

$host = "127.0.0.1";
$port = 5353;
// No Timeout 
set_time_limit(0);

<em>Port number can be any positive integer between 1024 -65535.</em>

<h4>Step 2: Create Socket</h4>
$socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0) or die("Could not create socket\n");

<h4>Step 3: Bind the socket to port and host</h4>

Here the created socket resource is bound to IP address and port number.

$result = socket_bind($socket, $host, $port) or die("Could not bind to socket\n");

<h4>Step 4: Start listening to the socket</h4>

After getting bound with IP and port server waits for the client to connect. 
Till then it keeps on waiting.

$result = socket_listen($socket, 3) or die("Could not set up socket listener\n");

<h4>Step 5: Accept incoming connection</h4>

This function accepts incoming connection request on the created socket. 
After accepting the connection from client socket, this function returns another socket resource that is actually responsible for communication with the corresponding client socket. 
Here “<code>$spawn</code>” is that socket resource which is responsible for communication with client socket.

$spawn = socket_accept($socket) or die("Could not accept incoming connection\n");

So far, we have prepared our server socket but the script doesn't actually do anything. 
Keeping to our aforesaid aim, we will read message from client socket and then send back reverse of the received message to the client socket again.

<h4>Step 6: Read the message from the Client socket</h4>

$input = socket_read($spawn, 1024) or die("Could not read input\n");

<h4>Step 7: Reverse the message</h4>

$output = strrev($input) . 
"\n";

<h4>Step 8: Send message to the client socket</h4>

socket_write($spawn, $output, strlen ($output)) or die("Could not write output\n"); 

<h4>Close the socket</h4>

socket_close($spawn);
socket_close($socket);

This completes with the server. 
Now we will learn to create PHP client.

<h3>PHP CLIENT</h3>

The first two steps are the same as in the server.

<h4>Step 1: Set variables such as "host" and "port"</h4>

$host = "127.0.0.1";
$port = 5353;
// No Timeout 
set_time_limit(0);

<em>Note: Here the port and host should be same as defined in server.</em>

<h4>Step 2: Create Socket</h4>

$socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0) or die("Could not create socket\n");

<h4>Step 3: Connect to the server</h4>

$result = socket_connect($socket, $host, $port) or die("Could not connect toserver\n");

Here unlike server, client socket is not bound with port and host. 
Instead it connects to server socket, waiting to accept the connection from client socket. 
Connection of client socket to server socket is established in this step.

<h4>Step 4: Write to server socket</h4>

socket_write($socket, $message, strlen($message)) or die("Could not send data to server\n");

In this step, client socket data is sent to the server socket.

<h4>Step 5: Read the response from the server</h4>

$result = socket_read ($socket, 1024) or die("Could not read server response\n");
echo "Reply From Server  :".$result;

<h4>Step 6: Close the socket</h4>

socket_close($socket);

<h3>Complete Code</h3>

<h4>SERVER (server.php)</h4>

// set some variables
$host = "127.0.0.1";
$port = 25003;
// don't timeout!
set_time_limit(0);
// create socket
$socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0) or die("Could not create socket\n");
// bind socket to port
$result = socket_bind($socket, $host, $port) or die("Could not bind to socket\n");
// start listening for connections
$result = socket_listen($socket, 3) or die("Could not set up socket listener\n");

// accept incoming connections
// spawn another socket to handle communication
$spawn = socket_accept($socket) or die("Could not accept incoming connection\n");
// read client input
$input = socket_read($spawn, 1024) or die("Could not read input\n");
// clean up input string
$input = trim($input);
echo "Client Message : ".$input;
// reverse client input and send back
$output = strrev($input) . 
"\n";
socket_write($spawn, $output, strlen ($output)) or die("Could not write output\n");
// close sockets
socket_close($spawn);
socket_close($socket);

<h4>CLIENT (client.php)</h4>

$host    = "127.0.0.1";
$port    = 25003;
$message = "Hello Server";
echo "Message To server :".$message;
// create socket
$socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0) or die("Could not create socket\n");
// connect to server
$result = socket_connect($socket, $host, $port) or die("Could not connect to server\n");  
// send string to server
socket_write($socket, $message, strlen($message)) or die("Could not send data to server\n");
// get server response
$result = socket_read ($socket, 1024) or die("Could not read server response\n");

After creating the above files (<em>server.php</em> and <em>client.php</em>), do as follows:

<ol>
<li>Copy these files in www directory (in case of WAMP), located at <em>C:\wamp</em>. 
</li><li>Open your web browser and type <code>localhost </code>in the address bar. 
</li><li>Browse <em>server.php</em> first followed by <em>client.php</em>. 
</li></ol>

<h2>PHP client server communication</h2>
usa a form as client and the server is welcome.php:

A Simple HTML Form
&lt;html>&lt;body>
&lt;form action="welcome.php" method="post">
&lt;!--- the replying page is welcome.php--->
Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name">&lt;br>
E-mail: &lt;input type="text" name="email">&lt;br>
&lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>
&lt;/body>&lt;/html>

welcome.php:
  Welcome &lt;?php echo $_POST["name"]; ?>&lt;br>
  Your email address is: &lt;?php echo $_POST["email"]; ?>

The POST Method
The POST method does not have any restriction on data size to be sent.
The POST method can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data.
The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header so security depends on HTTP protocol. 
By using Secure HTTP you can make sure that your information is secure.
The PHP provides $_POST associative array to access all the sent information using GET method.

Try out following example with client and server on same page:
&lt;html>&lt;body>
&lt;?php
  if( $_POST["name"] || $_POST["age"] )
  {
     echo "Welcome ". $_POST['name']. "&lt;br>";
     echo "You are ". $_POST['age']. " years old.". "&lt;br>";
     echo "and you are ". $_POST['sex']. ".&lt;br>";
     exit();
  }
?>
&lt;form action="" method="post">
  &lt;label for="name">Name:&lt;/label>&lt;br>
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name">&lt;br>
  &lt;label for="age">age:&lt;/label>&lt;br>
  &lt;input type="text" id="age" name="age">
  &lt;label for="sex">sex:&lt;/label>&lt;br>
  &lt;input type="text" id="sex" name="sex">&lt;br>
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit">
&lt;/form>
&lt;/body>&lt;/html>

The $_REQUEST variable
The PHP $_REQUEST variable contains the contents of both $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE. 

The PHP $_REQUEST variable can be used to get the result from form data sent with both the GET and POST methods.

Try out following example of $_REQUEST
&lt;?php
  if( $_REQUEST["name"] || $_REQUEST["age"] )
  {
     echo "Welcome ". $_REQUEST['name']. "&lt;br>";
     echo "You are ". $_REQUEST['age']. " years old.";
     exit();
  }
?>

$_PHP_SELF variable contains the name of self script in which it is being called.

The $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] is a super global variable that returns the filename of the currently executing script.

So, the $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] sends the submitted form data to the page itself, instead of jumping to a different page.
This way, the user will get error messages on the same page as the form.

&lt;form method="post" action="&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]);?>">

<h2>$_PHP_SELF</h2>
$_PHP_SELF variable contains the name of self script in which it is being called.

<h2>htmlspecialchars() function</h2>
The htmlspecialchars() function converts special characters to HTML entities.
This means that it will replace HTML characters like &lt; and > with &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;.
This prevents attackers from exploiting the code by injecting HTML or Javascript code (Cross-site Scripting attacks) in forms.


<h2>submit a form</h2>
&lt;form action="/action_page.php" onsubmit="myFunction()">
  Enter name: &lt;input type="text" name="fname">
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit">
&lt;/form>

&lt;script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("The form was submitted");
}
&lt;/script>

In HTML:
&lt;element onsubmit="myScript">

In JavaScript:
object.onsubmit = function(){myScript};

In JavaScript, using the addEventListener() method:
object.addEventListener("submit", myScript);

submit a form using javascript
document.getElementById("form1").submit();
or
document.forms["name of your form"].submit();
or
function placeOrder(form){
    form.submit();
}

<h2>echo input value in same page</h2>
&lt;form action="the-same-page.php">
    ... your code...
    &lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>

&lt;?php echo $_POST['nameField'] ?>

without submit:
&lt;input type="text" id="foo" 
   onchange="document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = this.value"/>

&lt;div id="output">output will be here&lt;/div>


&lt;input type="text" 
       name="idtest"
       value="&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($name); ?>"
/>

&lt;input type="text" name="idtest" value="&lt;?php echo $idtest; ?>" >


&lt;form action="welcome.php" method="get">
  First name: &lt;input type="text" name="fname">
&lt;/form>

Welcome &lt;?php echo $_GET["fname"]; ?>

<h2>submit form to itself in the same page</h2>

Use ?:
<form action="?" method="post">
It will send the user back to the same page.

Leave action attribute blank. 
The form will automatically submit itself in the same page.
<form action="">

Using php be sure to use:
action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]);?>"
