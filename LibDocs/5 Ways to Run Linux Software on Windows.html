<h1>5 Ways to Run Linux Software on Windows</h1>

<p>Linux users often want to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/133515/4-ways-to-run-windows-software-on-linux/">run Windows software on Linux</a>, but Windows users may want to run Linux software, too. Whether you&#8217;re looking for a better development environment or powerful command-line tools, you can run Linux software without leaving Windows.</p>
<p>There are many different options for running Linux software on Windows. It&#8217;s easier than running Windows software on Linux, as anyone can set up a virtual machine with a free Linux distribution &#8212; no need for software licenses.</p>

<h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Virtual machines allow you to run any operating system in a window on your desktop. You can install the free <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> or <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3607085-11482668-1454939709000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vmware.com%2Fproducts%2Fplayer.html&sid=ct170870">VMware Player</a>, download an ISO file for a Linux distribution such as <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu</a>, and install that Linux distribution inside the virtual machine like you would install it on a standard computer.</p>
<p>When you need to boot up your Linux system, you can do it in a window on your desktop &#8212; no need for rebooting and leaving all your Windows programs behind. Everything but demanding games and advanced 3D effects should work just fine, but you likely won&#8217;t want to use those, anyway.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine, you may want to try installing an <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/127259/choose-your-ubuntu-8-ubuntu-derivatives-with-different-desktop-environments/">Ubuntu derivative</a> like <a href="http://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a> instead. Ubuntu&#8217;s default <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/113330/how-to-master-ubuntus-unity-desktop-8-things-you-need-to-know/">Unity desktop</a> uses 3D effects and the desktop interface doesn&#8217;t perform as smoothly in a virtual machine as past desktops did. Xubuntu uses Xfce, which is much more lightweight.</p>
<p>You could even try using VirtualBox&#8217;s seamless mode or VMware&#8217;s unity mode to run Linux applications directly on your desktop &#8212; they&#8217;ll be running in the virtual machine, but their windows will be present on your Windows desktop instead of trapped in a single virtual machine window.</p>

<h2>Cygwin</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is a collection of tools that offer a Linux-like environment on Windows. It&#8217;s not a way to run existing Linux software on Windows &#8212; the software will have to be recompiled. However, much software has already been recompiled. Cygwin will give you a Linux-like terminal and command-line environment with many of the command-line programs you may already be used to.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve previously covered <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41382/how-to-use-linux-commands-in-windows-with-cygwin/">installing and using Cygwin</a>. You can even use Cygwin to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41560/how-to-get-ssh-command-line-access-to-windows-7-using-cygwin/">install an OpenSSH server and get SSH access to a Windows system</a>.</p>
<p>This solution is ideal for users missing crucial Linux utilities on Windows &#8212; it&#8217;s not a way to run a full Linux desktop.</p>

<h2>Install Ubuntu via Wubi</h2>
<p>This method is technically <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/128347/5-ways-to-try-out-and-install-ubuntu-on-your-computer/">installing Linux</a>, not running Linux software on Windows. You&#8217;ll have to reboot each time you want to use your Linux system just as if you had installed it in a standard dual-boot configuration.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer">Wubi</a> doesn&#8217;t install Ubuntu in the normal way. Instead, it creates a special file on your Windows partition and uses that file as your Ubuntu drive. This means that you can install Ubuntu and use it without any partitioning and you can uninstall Ubuntu from the Windows Control Panel when you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>If the partitioning aspects are what&#8217;s holding you back, give Wubi a try. Performance won&#8217;t be quite as good as a normally installed Linux system when it comes to disk read and write times, but it should be faster than a virtual machine.</p>
<h2>Ported and Compiled Programs</h2>
<p>Many common Linux programs have already been ported to Windows and compiled versions have been made available online. If you really miss Emacs, you&#8217;ll find <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/">versions of Emacs for Windows</a>. If you want to run a specific program on Windows, perform a Google search for the name of that program and &#8220;Windows&#8221; &#8212; there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll find a version of the program that &#8216;s been ported to Windows.</p>
<h2>coLinux-based Distributions</h2>
<p>coLinux stands for Cooperative Linux. It&#8217;s a way to natively run Linux alongside the Windows kernel in a way that offers much faster performance than simply running Linux in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>This is a great idea, but there&#8217;s a problem. coLinux doesn&#8217;t yet support 64-bit versions of Windows, so you&#8217;ll need to be running a 32-bit version of Windows on your machine to do this &#8212; that&#8217;s increasingly rare. coLinux hasn&#8217;t released a new version in over two years, so development seems to be either stalled or moving very slowly.</p>
<p>If you want to try this out, you may want to try out <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableubuntu/">Portable Ubuntu Remix</a>. This coLinux-based distribution was last updated in 2011, so it&#8217;s a bit old &#8212; but other options like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/andlinux/">andLinux</a> are even more out of date. andLinux, which <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/8112/run-linux-apps-on-your-windows-machine-the-easy-way/">we&#8217;ve covered in the past</a>, was last updated in 2009.</p>
<p>coLinux-based distributions would be a great option, but they seem to be getting left behind. If you don&#8217;t mind using years-old Linux software and a 32-bit version of Windows, this option may work for you anyway.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There&#8217;s no one right option here. People who want a full Linux experience will probably want a virtual machine, while users of a few crucial shell utilities may prefer Cygwin. Others who just want to run a single program may find better luck with a version of that program ported to Windows.</p>

<b>WAMP</b><br />Instead of LAMP you could use something native to Windows like WAMP (<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">http://www.wampserver.com/en/</a>
). <br /><br /><b>Cygwin</b><br />You can install Cygwin which will let you run use and run UNIX commands and programs natively within Windows. Cygwin has been updated to run on Windows 7 too. Here is a guide for how to setup LAMP on Windows using Cygwin: <a href="http://williamjxj.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/lamp-setting-on-a-windows-environment/">http://williamjxj.wordpress.com/...</a>
<br /><br /><b>Virtual Box</b><br />You could download Virtual Box for free, grab a free copy of Ubuntu Server, install and check the box during installation to also install LAMP accessories, and you are done. You will then be able to test your web app within Virtual Box.<br /><br />Note: The L in LAMP literally stands for &quot;Linux,&quot; you will probably run into portability issues using any of these as long as you&#039;re not running native Linux!


<br />This question is pretty common for the majority of Linux system administrators who work with multiple platforms. There is a number of common practices allowing to install Linux server on Windows 7, among those: dual-boot setup, virtualization and running off a USB stick. I give a brief review of each of those below. </p><p class="qtext_para"> <br />For the number one, I suggest accomplish dual-boot configuration, but only if you need to manage server from Ubuntu distributions. Dual-booting technique presumes Linux installation on your machine with pre installed Windows 7 in such a way that Linux distributions could recognize a device. Then you choose an appropriate dual or Linux-only configuration and start managing your servers. To help you with server management some decent app is needed, and here I can suggest <a href="https://serversuit.com/">ServerSuit</a>
.</p><p class="qtext_para"><br />You may also run Linux in a virtual machine, using Oracle VirtualBox as a preliminary application. Subsequently install a Linux ISO file to the VM and try to explore Linux applications in Windows 7. </p><p class="qtext_para"><br />Use LiveLinux Creator tool to create bootable USB device with Linux installation file, if you do not want to dedicate hard disk space for it. However, it is hard to predict superb execution of&nbsp; Linux commands from a USB stick. Use Linux features alternately to Windows 7, but ensure you have enough disk space for the&nbsp; additional software for both OS.<br /></p>

<br><br>
The best choice will be Vagrant. Don&#039;t spend your time to setup manually all linux environment using virtual machine. It will take a lot of time, it&#039;s to complicated for beginner. Use vagrant as a automation tool. Vagrant is a top layer for virtual environment. Automates process of environment preparation and makes it easier. It will be better for you as a beginner. htto://<a href="http://www.vagrantup.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 2586054);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="vagrantup.com">www.vagrantup.com</a>
 . Take your time to recognise it.
<br><br>

If you have sufficient resources in memory and CPU on your Windows 7 device, you can use VMWare or Virtualbox to install a complete Linux guest OS running as a Virtual Machine inside Windows.

I have been using Cygwin for somewhile.<br>
(1) Why Cygwin? Because it provides a Linux-alike environment, so you can use many Linux commands in Cygwin: vi, crontab, perl debug, shell scripts, soft-link, pipe, IPC, etc which make work very efficiently.<br>
Windows sometimes are very in-efficient, e.g, set PATH, alias, auto scripts, small/quick test scripts, server-side apps etc; However, for web developing purpose, it is necessary for some tools like photoshop, dreamweaver, Aptana etc.
Cygwin is a bridge to connect Linux server/DB/shell backend env with front-side developing in Windows.<br>
(2)
However the following are the shortcoming of Cygwin which I summary from my work:
1) very huge if install all: 11-13GB in my desktop. A developing environment with so huge space? Hard to accept.<br>
2) some very annoying problems, e.g for perl, cpan modules very hard to install; perl -d not working coz of ‘COLUMNS’ and ‘ROWS’ location; I have to debug perl script back to Linux server from cygwin testing environment.<br>
3) g++ is very easy to fail when compile some modules. e.g, if you compile some NodeJS modules, probably you failed in Cygwin env.<br>
In a summary, Cygwin is a connect bridge btw Win and Linux, but not quite stable and powerful. Probably Mac is a better choice.<br>
