<h2>Flow Fields, Part I</h2>
Flow fields are also known as vector fields. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"  rel="noopener nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field</a>

<h2>The Main Event: Flow Fields</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/888/1*6Geo5sKvZ6AaNm6AZXzxvQ.png">
In this image of iron filings revealing a magnetic field, you see various lines and loops. 
The strength and orientation of the magnetic force is different in different areas of the field. 

You can imagine that an object moving through this field would be influenced by it and tend to move along those visible lines.
Basically, that’s what we want to do — create a two-dimensional area where each point has a different value. 
But these aren’t just random values. 
A particular point has a particular value and as you move out from that point to neighboring points, you get similar, but gradually changing values. 

In flow fields, these values are usually interpreted as directions. 
So if you map your values so they are between 0 and 360, they can be directly used as degrees of direction. 
Of course, we’ll probably map them between 0 and 2 PI radians because the computer likes that better.
Once we have values for each point, we can graphically render each one based on it value. 

For example, we can draw a line pointing in the direction associated with that value.
So that brings us to two different tasks — how to come up with the different values for the field, and how to render the different values on the field. 
The great thing is, there are no correct answers for either one of those questions. 
In fact, there are nearly infinite ways of doing either one, so you can explore this technique for quite a while.

Let’s start out really simple, to get the idea of what’s going on. 
I’m just going to loop through from left to right and top to bottom, every 10 pixels. 
The value for that point on the grid will simply be <code>(x + y) * 0.01 % Math.PI * 2</code>. 
Just adding x and y together, scaling it down and modding it by 360 degrees (PI * 2 radians). 

Then we render that value by translating to that point, rotating by the value and drawing a short line at the point.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_Mq37FM9aYr5aeUm-DUKPA.png">
You might now see why this is starting to be something you’d call a “flow field”. 
As you follow the directions of the lines, you start to see some very directional motion going on.

We can start cleaning this up a bit by extracting the two things that we’ve already determined are going to change a lot — the calculation of the value and how each value point is rendered. 
We’ll put each one of those into its own function and call them where appropriate.
No change in behavior, but we’ve isolated the things that we now want to change. 
Furthermore, we don’t necessarily always want this to be in a strict grid. 

Instead we can grab any number of random points on the grid and render those.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*C0OH8N3skHahFf3Mn-f4MA.png">
At this point, we can just start messing with the formula we use to get the value. 
Generally, you’re going to want to use the x and y inputs somehow, but really, just do whatever you want here. 

Here’s a somewhat interesting one I came up with.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tMKDLJ0j3VEK8Fv4ljS48Q.png">
Now I could spend all day iterating on this — different formulas, different parameters for the lines it’s drawing etc. 
I know I could spend all day on it because I have spent whole days doing just that in the past. 

But let’s move on to something else.
Earlier I mentioned the idea that you could possibly imagine an object moving through a flow field and being influenced by those flows. 
Let’s simulate that. 
I’ll start with a single random point. 

Call it a particle. 
This particle will actually be an object with not only position, but velocity on the x and y axes. 
Initially these will be set to zero. 
On each iteration, wherever the particle is, we’ll get the value at that location — which is a direction, remember — and use that value to influence the particle’s velocity. 

Then we’ll add that velocity to the position to get a new position. 
And repeat.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2-zYxYVAVxO2LOZzL7xhyQ.png">
What’s interesting in this case is that we no longer actually see the field. 

We only see the result that the field has on the motion of the particle.
Do run this one on your own. 
It’s pretty neat to watch the drawing build up over time. 
You can see that the flow field is influencing the way the particle moves. 

You can change some of those hard-coded values to see what they do to the motion. 
Even in just our fifth iteration here, we have a ton of things to experiment with.
Let’s do one more for this article. 
Where one particle was fun, more particles is… more fun.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Pvqwxj8lA8JJ1Iyk9AdF6g.png">
OK, that’s enough for one article. 
In part two, we’ll look at some other ways to create fields and other ways to render them. 

If you want to play around with the code itself, you can either grab the gists I’ve embedded here, or just check out the full tutorial repo itself at <a href="https://github.com/bit101/tutorials"  rel="noopener nofollow">https://github.com/bit101/tutorials</a>
<h2>Flow Fields, Part II</h2>
In Flow Fields, Part I, we covered what a flow field is and looked at a few different formulas to create them. 
And we rendered flow fields in a various ways. 

We even animated particles being influenced by fields. 
In this article we’ll cover a couple more ways to generate flow fields and some new ways to render them. 
As I said in the first part, the possibilities are endless. 
I’m just pointing you in a few directions to get started.

<h2>Perlin Noise</h2>Using simple math and minimal trigonometry gave us some pretty interesting patterns, but they wound up being very regular and repeating. 
The more complex function we used (the strange attractor) made for a fairly uninteresting field by itself, but was beautiful with particles tracing lines across it.
What would be nice is something complex but non-repeating. 
Perlin noise fits the bill, which is why it is used so often to create flow fields. 

Perlin noise was invented by Ken Perlin and was initially used to generate natural looking textures for computer generated special effects in movies and video games. 
It gives you random values across a two- or three-dimensional field, and ensures that there is a nice, smooth gradient between the various values. 
With different settings, scaling and colors applied, you can get textures that look like smoke, fire, liquid, wood grain, rusty metal, etc.
We can tap into Perlin noise to create a flow field that varies all over the place and never repeats. 

And we can animate it as well by creating a 3D Perlin noise field and moving through slices of it on the z-axis. 
More on that soon.
If you’re using Processing or some other platform, you may have a Perlin noise function built in. 
If you’re just using plain vanilla JavaScript like me, however, you’ll need a Perlin noise library to generate the values. 

There are a few out there. 
I’m going to use one by Seph Gentle (josephg on github) at <a href="https://github.com/josephg/noisejs" rel="noopener nofollow">https://github.com/josephg/noisejs</a> . 
I’ve downloaded that into my project folder.
I’m going to start with the same basic HTML file as last time, and add the <code>perlin.js</code>library in the script tag.


And here’s the first script file:

The first block is the same as before. 

Then we seed the Perlin noise library with a random number so we’ll get a new image each time, and call render.
The <code>render</code> function loops through the canvas in a grid-like fashion as before, getting a value and drawing a line there. 
All pretty much the same as last time.
It’s the <code>getValue</code> function that changes. 

Now we’re going to get the value directly from the Perlin noise function. 
This noise library has a few different functions. 
We’ll use the 2d Perlin noise function, <code>perlin2</code>, for now. 
This just takes an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code>. 

We’ll scale it down somewhat to make a more interesting pattern. 
The result of this is a number from -1 to +1. 
So we can multiply that by 2 PI to get a direction in radians. 
That’s all, folks. 

And here’s what it gives us:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wmh2_4I2q0mifmLx_j3wUQ.png">

Pretty cool, eh? Let’s change the <code>res</code>variable to 2. 

This makes a much tighter grid:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3LLDozb4psZyie6VUt8CZQ.jpeg">

And now we can see what happens if we change the scale, to maybe 0.004.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-BlhNMxr31p-WqsZcMPSlA.png">

It’s like zooming in.
Now, consider 3d Perlin noise as a stack of these 2d Perlin flow fields layered on top of each other, each one varying just a bit. 

If we could flip through them, one by one, we could see them animating. 
That’s exactly what our next file does, using the <code>noise.perlin3</code> function:

Here, we add a <code>z</code> variable set to zero. 

Then we clear the canvas at the start of render so we can redraw each time. 
Finally, we increase <code>z </code>by a very small amount and call <code>requestAnimationFrame(render)</code> to set up the next frame of the animation.
The <code>getValue</code> function calls <code>noise.perlin3</code>, passing in the current <code>z</code> . 
No other changes. 

A still image would look about the same as the first image in this article, but if you actually run this one, you’ll see a lovely, flowing animation, reminiscent of seaweed, or amber waves of grain.
OK, what’s next? Well, last time we moved on to having the flow field influence the movement of some particles. 
We’ll do the same thing here, using the Perlin-based flow field.


Again, we create a column of particles on the left edge of the screen, and on each frame, update each particle’s position and draw a line from its last position to where it currently is. 
This gives us a trail of its movement. 
The major change here is, again, that we’re using Perlin noise to calculate the flow field. 
Here’s what we get:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*aU0nk-6r-aBwQ-IsDZMRzA.png">

And of course, this looks even cooler as you watch it animate and build up.
One last Perlin example. 

We’ll use 3d Perlin noise again. 
This time, on each frame, we’ll create a column of particles down the center of the canvas and iterate each one’s path 500 times. 
That will create a bunch of flowing lines. 
Then we’ll update <em>z</em> and draw the next frame. 

Now, the path of each particle is altered a bit differently on each frame, so you get an eerie, undulating flow going on. 
The further out from their source each particle gets, the more its path differs from the last frame. 
Sometimes it jumps off in a totally different direction, giving it a weird, glitchy feeling. 
The code:


And a single frame of the animation, which you’ll want to see in motion:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gHiiK6RqT25GATYo3SaTdg.png">


<h2>What else?</h2>Well, we’ve created flow fields with simple and complex formulas and used third party libraries to create them. 
You might want to play with the simplex noise contained in that noise library we were using. 
It’s similar to Perlin noise, also created by Ken Perlin, but has a bit of a different feel to it.
But really we can use anything we want to create a flow field. 

All we need is something that maps an x, y coordinate to a value. 
So where could we get a source of values that are mapped to x, y coordinates? Like a map of different… bits of information… like a bit… map. 
OK, I guess you see where I’m going here. 
So yeah, any image is simply a 2d map of values. 

If we can take an image and pass in x and y to some function to get the value at that location, we are golden. 
And in HTML canvas, we can. 
And it’s likely you can do the same thing if you are using some other system.
I’ve created a <code>Bitmap</code> module. 

I’m not going to show it or go into it much here, but you can check out the source at the repo I’ll post at the end of the article. 
The module takes a <code>url</code> and an <code>onComplete</code> callback that gets called when it’s ready. 
It then has a <code>getValue</code> method that takes <code>x,y</code> parameters and returns a value between 0 and 255. 
This is an average of the red, green and blue values of that pixel and basically equates the brightness of the image at that point.

Here’s how we use it:

We create the initial canvas, but we don’t size it full screen like we did before. 
Then we create the bitmap and wait for it to complete. 

When it does, we set the canvas to be the same size as the bitmap, create 1000 random points, and call <code>render</code>.
Most of <code>render</code> should look pretty familiar. 
Get the value at the current location and use that to influence the particle’s velocity. 
Note that I extracted a couple of values, <code>force</code> and <code>friction</code>. 

Playing with these can give you very different behaviors. 
Try out different values. 
The other main difference here is that if a particle goes off the canvas, we set it back to a random location again.
Finally, the <code>getValue</code> function calls <code>bitmap.getValue</code>. 

Remember, that will return a value from 0 to 255. 
So we convert that to be in the range of 2 PI. 
And that’s it.
All you have to do is supply it an image. 

Note that for security reasons, you’re not going to just be able to link to any image from anywhere on the web, and you’re probably not going to be able to run this example from the file system. 
I just set up a simple <code>node.js</code> based server using the <code>http-server</code> package and serve the app and image from there as <code>localhost:8080</code>.
Supplying a random cat image (because this is the Internet, after all), we get the following:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vM-y9jIuuLR30FdyGUaX-A.png">


You might even be able to see a hint of the cat there. 
But if you uncomment line 12 in the code, it will draw the original image before starting to animate the particles. 
With that, you see the following:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*MC_wDYlGXabEyPZDbRiMdg.png">

So, there’s a few more ideas. 
Different images, different settings, different ways of rendering or animating, all make for infinite possibilities. 

Now you can go explore some of them. 
Have fun.
The code for all of this can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/bit101/tutorials" rel="noopener nofollow">https://github.com/bit101/tutorials</a> . 
Note that the code here is not necessarily super clean or ruggedly tested. 
I’m just having fun here and pretty much just stopped when things looked good.

<h2>perlin noise</h2>
A flow field is a grid of vectors where neighboring values relate to one another. 
It's used to create generative effects where objects that travel over it look as if they're "flowing" through some sort of stream, or gust in the wind. 

The creation of the flow field starts with laying out an array of points on a 2D (or 3D) canvas.

From there, a line is drawn from each individual point to help visualize which direction they will push any particle that travels over them. 
With the lines drawn on the grid, a flow field can be formed by using a two-dimensional Perlin noise function that for each iteration, returns a value that's related to the previous one, varying from 0-1. 
To access the full degrees of a circular rotation, we multiply this 0-1 Perlin Noise value by 3.14 (PI) * 2.

With the rotation taking effect, a flow field should form, giving us the ability to create art in more than a number of ways.
