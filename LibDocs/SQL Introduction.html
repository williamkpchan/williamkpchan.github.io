<h2>DML (Data Manipulation Language) Commands in MySQL</h2>
<strong>Some commands of DML are:</strong>
SELECT: retrieve data from a database
INSERT: insert data into a table
UPDATE: updates existing data within a table
DELETE: deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain
MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)
CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
LOCK TABLE: control concurrency

<h3>- Insert :</h3>
The insert statement is used to add new row to a table.

<i>INSERT INTO &lt;table name&gt; VALUES (&lt;value 1&gt;, ... &lt;value n&gt;);</i>
Example:

INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES (1001,&lsquo;Ram&rsquo;);
The inserted values must match the table structure exactly in the number of attributes and the data type of each attribute. 
Character type values are always enclosed in single quotes; number values are never in quotes; date values are often (but not always) in the format &lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd&rsquo; (for example, &lsquo;2006-11- 30&rsquo;).

<h3>- UPDATE :</h3>
The update statement is used to change values that are already in a table.

<i>&nbsp;UPDATE &lt;table name&gt; SET &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;expression&gt; WHERE &lt;condition&gt;;</i>
Example:

UPDATE STUDENT SET Name = &lsquo;Amar&rsquo; WHERE StudID=1001;
The update expression can be a constant, any computed value, or even the result of a SELECT statement that returns a single row and a single column.

<h3>- DELETE :</h3>
The delete statement deletes row(s) from a table.

<i>DELETE FROM &lt;table name&gt; WHERE &lt;condition&gt;;</i>
Example:

DELETE FROM STUDENT WHERE StudID=1001;
If the WHERE clause is omitted, then every row of the table is deleted that matches with the specified condition.

<h3>- SELECT :</h3>
The SELECT statement is used to form queries for extracting information out of the database.

<i>SELECT &lt;attribute&gt;, &hellip;.., &lt;attribute n&gt; FROM &lt;table name&gt;;</i>
Example:

SELECT StudID, Name FROM STUDENT;
Apart from these statements, some statements are also used to control the transaction made by DML statements. 
The commands used for this purpose are called Transaction Control (TCL) statements. 
It allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions. 
Some commands of TCL are:

COMMIT: save work done.
SAVEPOINT: identify a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back.
ROLLBACK: restore database to original since the last COMMIT.


<h2>Query</h2>
SQL queries will help you sort through a massive dataset, to retrieve only the information that you need.
We'll begin by using the keywords <strong>SELECT</strong>, <strong>FROM</strong>, and <strong>WHERE</strong> to get data from specific columns based on conditions you specify.
For clarity, we'll work with a small imaginary dataset <code>pet_records</code> which contains just one table, called <code>pets</code>.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fI5Pvvp.png" width="800px;">

<h2>SELECT ... FROM</h2>
The most basic SQL query selects a single column from a single table.  
To do this,
specify the column you want after the word <strong>SELECT</strong>, and then 
specify the table after the word <strong>FROM</strong>.  
For instance, to select the <code>Name</code> column (from the <code>pets</code> table in the <code>pet_records</code> database in the <code>bigquery-public-data</code> project), our query would appear as follows:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/c3GxYRt.png" width="800px;">
Note that when writing an SQL query, the argument we pass to <strong>FROM</strong> is <em>not</em> in single or double quotation marks (' or "). It is in backticks (`).
<h2>WHERE ...</h2>
BigQuery datasets are large, so you'll usually want to return only the rows meeting specific conditions. You can do this using the <strong>WHERE</strong> clause.
The query below returns the entries from the <code>Name</code> column that are in rows where the <code>Animal</code> column has the text <code>'Cat'</code>.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HJOT8Kb.png" width="800px;">
<h2>Example: What are all the U.S. cities in the OpenAQ dataset?</h2>

Now that you've got the basics down, let's work through an example with a real dataset. We'll use an 
<a href="https://openaq.org">OpenAQ</a> dataset about air quality.
First, we'll set up everything we need to run queries and take a quick peek at what tables are in our database.  (
<em>Since you learned how to do this in the previous tutorial, we have hidden the code.  
But if you'd like to take a peek, you need only click on the "Code" button below.</em>)

Code
In [1]:

from google.cloud import bigquery

# Create a "Client" object
client = bigquery.Client()

# Construct a reference to the "openaq" dataset

dataset_ref = client.dataset("openaq",project="bigquery-public-data")
# API request - fetch the dataset

dataset=client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)
# List all the tables in the "openaq" dataset

tables = list(client.list_tables(dataset))

# Print names of all tables in the dataset (there's only one!)

for table in tables :
   print(table.table_id)



Using Kaggle's public dataset BigQuery integration.
global_air_quality
 

The dataset contains only one table, called <code>global_air_quality</code>.  
We'll fetch the table and take a peek at the first few rows to see what sort of data it contains.  (Again, we have hidden the code.  
To take a peek, click on the "Code" button below.) 
Code
In [2]:



# Construct a reference to the "global_air_quality" table table_ref=dataset_ref.
table ("global_air_quality")

# API request - fetch the table table=client.
get_table(table_ref)

# Preview the first five lines of the "global_air_quality" table client.
list_rows(table , max_results=5).to_dataframe ()

Everything looks good! So, let's put together a query. Say we want to select all the values from the <code>city</code> column that are in rows where the <code>country</code> column is <code>'US'</code> (for "United States"). 

In [3]:



# Query to select all the items from the "city" column where the "country" column is 'US'
query ="""
       SELECT city
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.openaq.global_air_quality`
       WHERE country = 'US'
       """
 

Take the time now to ensure that this query lines up with what you learned above.
<h2>Submitting the query to the dataset</h2>

We're ready to use this query to get information from the OpenAQ dataset.  
As in the previous tutorial, the first step is to create a <code>Client</code> object. 
In [4]:


# Create a "Client" object client=bigquery.Client ()
 


Using Kaggle's public dataset BigQuery integration.

 

We begin by setting up the query with the <code>query()</code> method.  
We run the method with the default parameters, but this method also allows us to specify more complicated settings that you can read about in the documentation.  
We'll revisit this later. 
In [5]:


# Set up the query query_job=client.
query(query) 

Next, we run the query and convert the results to a pandas DataFrame. 
In [6]:



# API request - run the query, and return a pandas DataFrame us_cities=query_job.
to_dataframe ()
 

Now we've got a pandas DataFrame called <code>us_cities</code>, which we can use like any other DataFrame. 
In [7]:



# What five cities have the most measurements? us_cities.city.value_counts ().head ()
 

Out[7]: 

Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale                     87
Houston                                     80
New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island    60
Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana            60
Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario            59
Name: city, dtype: int64
 
<h2>More queries</h2>
If you want multiple columns, you can select them with a comma between the names: 
In [8]:

query ="""
       SELECT city, country
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.openaq.global_air_quality`
       WHERE country = 'US'
       """
 

You can select all columns with a <code>*</code> like this: 
In [9]:


query="""
       SELECT *
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.openaq.global_air_quality`
       WHERE country = 'US'
       """
 
<h2>Q&amp;A: Notes on formatting</h2>
The formatting of the SQL query might feel unfamiliar. If you have any questions, you can ask in the comments section at the bottom of this page.  
Here are answers to two common questions:
<h3><strong>Question: What's up with the triple quotation marks (""")?</strong>
</h3> <em>Answer</em>: These tell Python that everything inside them is a single string, even though we have line breaks in it. The line breaks aren't necessary, but they make it easier to read your query.
<h3>
<strong>Question: Do you need to capitalize SELECT and FROM?</strong>
</h3> <em>Answer</em>: No, SQL doesn't care about capitalization. However, it's customary to capitalize your SQL commands, and it makes your queries a bit easier to read. 

<h2>Working with big datasets</h2>

BigQuery datasets can be huge. We allow you to do a lot of computation for free, but everyone has some limit.

<strong>Each Kaggle user can scan 5TB every 30 days for free. Once you hit that limit, you'll have to wait for it to reset.</strong>

The biggest dataset currently on Kaggle is 3TB, so you can go through your 30-day limit in a couple queries if you aren't careful.
Don't worry though: we'll teach you how to avoid scanning too much data at once, so that you don't run over your limit.
To begin,you can estimate the size of any query before running it. Here is an example using the (
<em>very large!</em>) Hacker News dataset. To see how much data a query will scan, we create a <code>QueryJobConfig</code> object and set the <code>dry_run</code> parameter to <code>True</code>. 
In [10]:

# Query to get the score column from every row where the type column has value "job" query
=
"""       SELECT score, title
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full`
       WHERE type = "job" 
       """

# Create a QueryJobConfig object to estimate size of query without running it dry_run_config=bigquery.

QueryJobConfig ( dry_run= True)
# API request - dry run query to estimate costs dry_run_query_job=client.
query(query ,

job_config= dry_run_config) print (

"This query will process 

{}

bytes.".
format(dry_run_query_job.
total_bytes_processed))
 


This query will process 399514186 bytes.

 
You can also specify a parameter when running the query to limit how much data you are willing to scan. Here's an example with a low limit. 
n [11]:

# Only run the query if it's less than 1 MB ONE_MB
=
1000 *
1000 safe_config=bigquery.
QueryJobConfig ( maximum_bytes_billed= ONE_MB)
# Set up the query (will only run if it's less than 1 MB) safe_query_job=client.
query(query ,

job_config= safe_config)
# API request - try to run the query, and return a pandas DataFrame safe_query_job.
to_dataframe ()

<h2>A procedure</h2>
A procedure (often called a stored procedure) is a subroutine stored in database. 

<h2>A trigger</h2>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs. For example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted into a specified table or when certain table columns are being updated. </p>

The CREATE TRIGGER statement allows you to create a new trigger that is fired automatically whenever an event such as INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE occurs against a table.

The following illustrates the syntax of the CREATE TRIGGER statement:

CREATE TRIGGER [schema_name.]trigger_name
ON table_name
AFTER  {[INSERT],[UPDATE],[DELETE]}
[NOT FOR REPLICATION]
AS
{sql_statements}

In this syntax:
<ul><li>The <code>schema_name</code> is the name of the schema to which the new trigger belongs. The schema name is optional.</li><li>The <code>trigger_name</code> is the user-defined name for the new trigger.</li><li>The <code>table_name</code> is the table to which the trigger applies.</li><li>The event is listed in the <code>AFTER</code> clause. The event could be <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code>. A single trigger can fire in response to one or more actions against the table.</li><li>The <code>NOT FOR REPLICATION</code> option instructs SQL Server not to fire the trigger when data modification is made as part of a replication process.</li><li>The <code>sql_statements</code> is one or more Transact-SQL used to carry out actions once an event occurs.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>  </p>
<pre>create trigger [trigger_name] 
[before | after]  
{insert | update | delete}  
on [table_name]  
[for each row]  
[trigger_body] </pre>

<li>create trigger [trigger_name]: Creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.
</li>
<li>[before | after]: This specifies when the trigger will be executed.
</li>
<li>{insert | update | delete}: This specifies the DML operation.
</li>
<li>on [table_name]: This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.
</li>
<li>[for each row]: This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed for each row being affected.
</li>
<li>[trigger_body]: This provides the operation to be performed as trigger is fired
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>BEFORE and AFTER of Trigger:</strong><br />
BEFORE triggers run the trigger action before the triggering statement is run.<br />
AFTER triggers run the trigger action after the triggering statement is run.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Given Student Report Database, in which student marks assessment is recorded. In such schema, create a trigger so that the total and average of specified marks is automatically inserted whenever a record is insert.</p>
<p>Here, as trigger will invoke before record is inserted so, BEFORE Tag can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Suppose the database Schema &#8211;</strong></p>
<pre>mysql&gt; desc Student; 
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ 
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          | 
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ 
| tid   | int(4)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
| name  | varchar(30) | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
| subj1 | int(2)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
| subj2 | int(2)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
| subj3 | int(2)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
| total | int(3)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
| per   | int(3)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ 
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
<p>SQL Trigger to problem statement.</p>
<pre>create trigger stud_marks 
before INSERT 
on 
Student 
for each row 
set Student.total = Student.subj1 + Student.subj2 + Student.subj3, Student.per = Student.total * 60 / 100;</pre>
<p>Above SQL statement will create a trigger in the student database in which whenever subjects marks are entered, before inserting this data into the database, trigger will compute those two values and insert with the entered values. i.e.,</p>
<pre>mysql&gt; insert into Student values(0, "ABCDE", 20, 20, 20, 0, 0); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.09 sec) 

mysql&gt; select * from Student; 
+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ 
| tid | name  | subj1 | subj2 | subj3 | total | per  | 
+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ 
| 100 | ABCDE |    20 |    20 |    20 |    60 |   36 | 
+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ 
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
<p>In this way trigger can be creates and executed in the databases.</p>

<h2>SQL Views</h2>
Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. 
A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. 
We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. 
A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.
In this article we will learn about creating , deleting and updating Views.<br />
<strong>Sample Tables</strong>:
StudentDetails

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-57-300x125.png">
StudentMarks
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-58-300x126.png">
<strong>CREATING VIEWS</strong>
We can create View using <strong>CREATE VIEW</strong> statement. 
A View can be created from a single table or multiple tables.
<strong>Syntax</strong>:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

<strong>view_name</strong>: Name for the View
<strong>table_name</strong>: Name of the table
<strong>condition</strong>: Condition to select rows

<strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating View from a single table:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In this example we will create a View named DetailsView from the table StudentDetails.<br />
Query:
CREATE VIEW DetailsView AS
SELECT NAME, ADDRESS
FROM StudentDetails
WHERE S_ID &lt; 5;

To see the data in the View, we can query the view in the same manner as we query a table.
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;

Output:<br />
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-571-300x156.png"></li>
<li>In this example, we will create a view named StudentNames from the table StudentDetails.<br />
Query:

CREATE VIEW StudentNames AS
SELECT S_ID, NAME
FROM StudentDetails
ORDER BY NAME;

If we now query the view as,
SELECT * FROM StudentNames;

Output:<br />
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-64-300x126.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Creating View from multiple tables</strong>: In this example we will create a View named MarksView from two tables StudentDetails and StudentMarks. 
To create a View from multiple tables we can simply include multiple tables in the SELECT statement. 
Query:
CREATE VIEW MarksView AS
SELECT StudentDetails.NAME, StudentDetails.ADDRESS, StudentMarks.MARKS
FROM StudentDetails, StudentMarks
WHERE StudentDetails.NAME = StudentMarks.NAME;

To display data of View MarksView:
SELECT * FROM MarksView;

Output:<br />
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-591-300x105.png"></li>
</ul>
<strong>DELETING VIEWS</strong>
We have learned about creating a View, but what if a created View is not needed any more? Obviously we will want to delete it. 
SQL allows us to delete an existing View. 
We can delete or drop a View using the DROP statement.
<strong>Syntax</strong>:
DROP VIEW view_name;

<strong>view_name</strong>: Name of the View which we want to delete.

For example, if we want to delete the View <strong>MarksView</strong>, we can do this as:
DROP VIEW MarksView;

<strong>UPDATING VIEWS</strong>
There are certain conditions needed to be satisfied to update a view. 
If any one of these conditions is <strong>not</strong> met, then we will not be allowed to update the view.
<ol>
<li>The SELECT statement which is used to create the view should not include GROUP BY clause or ORDER BY clause.</li>
<li>The SELECT statement should not have the DISTINCT keyword.</li>
<li>The View should have all NOT NULL values.</li>
<li>The view should not be created using nested queries or complex queries.</li>
<li>The view should be created from a single table. 
If the view is created using multiple tables then we will not be allowed to update the view.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We can use the <strong>CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW</strong> statement to add or remove fields from a view.<br />
<strong>Syntax</strong>:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1,coulmn2,..
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

For example, if we want to update the view <strong>MarksView</strong> and add the field AGE to this View from <strong>StudentMarks </strong>Table, we can do this as:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW MarksView AS
SELECT StudentDetails.NAME, StudentDetails.ADDRESS, StudentMarks.MARKS, StudentMarks.AGE
FROM StudentDetails, StudentMarks
WHERE StudentDetails.NAME = StudentMarks.NAME;

If we fetch all the data from MarksView now as:
SELECT * FROM MarksView;

Output:<br />
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-60-300x78.png"></li>
<li><strong>Inserting a row in a view</strong>:<br />
We can insert a row in a View in a same way as we do in a table. 
We can use the INSERT INTO statement of SQL to insert a row in a View.<strong>Syntax</strong>:
INSERT view_name(column1, column2 , column3,..) 
VALUES(value1, value2, value3..);

<strong>view_name</strong>: Name of the View

<strong>Example</strong>:<br />
In the below example we will insert a new row in the View DetailsView which we have created above in the example of &#8220;creating views from a single table&#8221;.
INSERT INTO DetailsView(NAME, ADDRESS)
VALUES("Suresh","Gurgaon");

If we fetch all the data from DetailsView now as,
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;

Output:<br />
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-62-300x194.png"></li>
<li><strong>Deleting a row from a View</strong>:<br />
Deleting rows from a view is also as simple as deleting rows from a table. 
We can use the DELETE statement of SQL to delete rows from a view. 
Also deleting a row from a view first delete the row from the actual table and the change is then reflected in the view.<strong>Syntax</strong>:
DELETE FROM view_name
WHERE condition;

<strong>view_name</strong>:Name of view from where we want to delete rows
<strong>condition</strong>: Condition to select rows 

<strong>Example</strong>:<br />
In this example we will delete the last row from the view DetailsView which we just added in the above example of inserting rows.
DELETE FROM DetailsView
WHERE NAME="Suresh";

If we fetch all the data from DetailsView now as,
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;

Output:<br />
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-571-300x156.png"></li>
</ul>
<strong>WITH CHECK OPTION</strong>
The WITH CHECK OPTION clause in SQL is a very useful clause for views. 
It is applicable to a updatable view. 
If the view is not updatable, then there is no meaning of including this clause in the CREATE VIEW statement.
<ul>
<li>The WITH CHECK OPTION clause is used to prevent the insertion of rows in the view where the condition in the WHERE clause in CREATE VIEW statement is not satisfied.</li>
<li>If we have used the WITH CHECK OPTION clause in the CREATE VIEW statement, and if the UPDATE or INSERT clause does not satisfy the conditions then they will return an error.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Example</strong>:<br />
In the below example we are creating a View SampleView from StudentDetails Table with WITH CHECK OPTION clause.
CREATE VIEW SampleView AS
SELECT S_ID, NAME
FROM  StudentDetails
WHERE NAME IS NOT NULL
WITH CHECK OPTION;

In this View if we now try to insert a new row with null value in the NAME column then it will give an error because the view is created with the condition for NAME column as NOT NULL.<br />
For example,though the View is updatable but then also the below query for this View is not valid:
INSERT INTO SampleView(S_ID)
VALUES(6);

<strong>NOTE</strong>: The default value of NAME column is <em>null</em>.

<h2><span class="white">How to use phpMyAdmin</span></h2>

This article will explain how you can use PHPMyAdmin and how to create a database dump.
By default it is accessible at <code>http://appname.hypernode.io/phpmyadmin</code>
For protection, phpMyAdmin by default is only accessible through the <code>appname.hypernode.io/phpmyadmin</code> URL, on Vagrant via the <code>appname.hypernode.local/phpmyadmin</code> url and on Docker through <code>YourBaseURL/dbadmin</code> after you followed <a href="https://support.hypernode.com/knowledgebase/use-phpmyadmin/#Reroute_phpmyadmin_to_dbadmin_and_add_a_whitelist">these</a> instructions. 
You can adjust this behaviour to your own preference.

<h2>Working with phpMyAdmin</h2>
<h3>Access phpMyAdmin</h3>
<h4>Credentials</h4>
PHPMyAdmin uses the same user and password your database uses. 
You can find them safely stored in <code>/data/web/.my.cnf</code>.
<h4>All customers: via URL</h4>
Did you order a trial via Hypernode.com? Please be aware you do not have access to a control panel yet. 
Access phpMyAdmin only via <code>http://appname.hypernode.io/phpmyadmin</code>.
You can log in using the credentials supplied in your .my.cnf file or through the user/password you might have created.
<h4>Dutch customers: via Service Panel</h4>
As a Dutch customer you can access phpMyAdmin via your Service Panel as well:

Log in to the <a href="https://service.byte.nl/protected/overzicht/">Byte Service Panel</a>
Select your Hypernode plan
Click on the Hypernode tab.
Click phpMyAdmin

<a href="http://support.hypernode.com/assets/uploads/pms_service_panel.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-418" class="size-large wp-image-418" src="http://support.hypernode.com/assets/uploads/pms_service_panel-300x174.png" alt="phpMyAdmin is accessible through the Service panel" width="300" height="174" /></a>Use phpMyAdmin on Hypernode
<h3>Create a database dump using phpMyAdmin</h3>

Go To <code>http://appname.hypernode.io/phpmyadmin</code>
Click on “Databases” and select the database.
Click on “Export”.
Click on “Go” and the export/backup will be available.

<strong>If you have a large database, making a database dump through phpMyAdmin is not very reliable. 
Before importing it, make sure the integrity of your database dump is sane!</strong>
<h2>Configure phpMyAdmin</h2>
<h3>Create whitelisting and/or basic_auth config</h3>
If you haven&#8217;t <a href="https://support.hypernode.com/knowledgebase/create-reusable-for-custom-nginx-locations/">created a whitelist or basic_auth config using include files</a> to protect your <code>phpmyadmin</code> from unsolicited IP addresses, do this first before you follow the instructions below.
<h3>Using phpMyAdmin over SSL or through another URL</h3>
When you <a href="https://support.hypernode.com/knowledgebase/redirect-all-http-traffic-to-https-in-nginx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redirect all traffic to HTTPS</a>, you might experience a SSL browser error when connecting to PHPMyAdmin as the SSL certificate of your domain does not match the .hypernode.io domain name.
To avoid this, there are 2 possible solutions:

<a href="https://support.hypernode.com/knowledgebase/use-lets-encrypt-hypernode/">Use Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> and create an SSL certificate for appname.hypernode.io.
Adjust your Nginx config to make phpMyAdmin accessible through another url then appname.hypernode.io.

For the latter, use the instructions below.
<h3>Reroute /phpmyadmin to /dbadmin and add a whitelist</h3>
When you want to use phpMyAdmin over SSL, or you want to add a whitelist with IP&#8217;s that are allowed to access phpMyAdmin, you can do so by moving phpMyAdmin to another URL that we can adjust to our needs:

First, create a symlink in <code>/data/web/public</code>:
<textarea wrap="soft" class="crayon-plain print-no" data-settings="dblclick" readonly style="-moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 16px !important;">
ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ /data/web/public/dbadmin</textarea>

1

ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ /data/web/public/dbadmin

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->

For Magento 2, depending on your symlink settings you can use the same command as for a Magento 1 environment or you can use this command for the symlink:

<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<textarea wrap="soft" class="crayon-plain print-no" data-settings="dblclick" readonly style="-moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 16px !important;">
ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ /data/web/magento2/pub/dbadmin</textarea>

1

ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ /data/web/magento2/pub/dbadmin

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->

Next, create a snippet in /data/web/nginx called <code>server.phpmyadmin</code> with the following content:

<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<textarea wrap="soft" class="crayon-plain print-no" data-settings="dblclick" readonly style="-moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 16px !important;">
location /dbadmin {
# Only allow IP addresses defined in /data/web/include.whitelist
include /etc/nginx/app/include.whitelist;

# Uncomment to secure phpMyAdmin with additional basic_auth
# include /etc/nginx/app/include.basic_auth;

try_files $uri $uri/ /dbadmin/index.php last;

location ~ \.php$ {
echo_exec @phpfpm;
}
}</textarea>

12345678910111213

location /dbadmin {# Only allow IP addresses defined in /data/web/include.whitelistinclude /etc/nginx/app/include.whitelist; 
# Uncomment to secure phpMyAdmin with additional basic_auth# include /etc/nginx/app/include.basic_auth; 
try_files $uri $uri/ /dbadmin/index.php last; 
location ~ \.php$ {echo_exec @phpfpm;}}

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0010 seconds] -->

Next, create the include.whitelist in /data/web/nginx and add your IP(s) to the snippet

<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<textarea wrap="soft" class="crayon-plain print-no" data-settings="dblclick" readonly style="-moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 16px !important;">
allow XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX;
deny all;</textarea>

12

allow XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX;deny all;

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->

And finally visit phpMyAdmin on https://yourdomain.nl/dbadmin
<strong>This will only add another URL where phpMyAdmin is accessible. 
If you only want to use this endpoint, block all access to <code>/phpmyadmin</code> too</strong>
<h3>Blocking all access to phpMyAdmin</h3>
If you want to fully disable phpMyAdmin, create the following snippet as <code>/data/web/nginx/server.phpmyadmin</code>:
<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<textarea wrap="soft" class="crayon-plain print-no" data-settings="dblclick" readonly style="-moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 16px !important;">
## Block PHPMyAdmin
location ~* phpmyadmin {
deny all;
}</textarea>

1234

## Block PHPMyAdminlocation ~* phpmyadmin {deny all;}

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->

<h2>Troubleshooting phpMyAdmin</h2>

The phpMyAdmin button in the control panel redirects to <code>https://</code> and gives a 404 in Nginx

This is probably because you redirect ALL traffic over HTTPS. 
Try using PHPMyAdmin over ssl as explained above.

I&#8217;m receiving an error while dumping the database

Most of the time this happens when a database is large and you exceed the <code>max_execution_time</code> or <code>memory_limit</code> in php. 
If this happens try <a href="https://support.hypernode.com/knowledgebase/using-mysql-on-hypernode/#Creating_a_MySQL_back-up">dumping your database on the command line</a>

My phpMyAdmin does not show any images

This happens when you redirect all traffic to HTTPS, causing mixed content errors in your browser. 
To solve this, use phpMyAdmin over SSL.

Static content doesn&#8217;t (fully) display

This happens if you define a regex location block in your nginx config that matches phpmyadmin&#8217;s static files; This will override the existing config for static files under /phpmyadmin/. 
To solve this, you will have to change your custom location block to not match files in the /phpmyadmin/ location.

to run a single MySQL query from your regular shell instead of from MySQL's interactive command line you would do this:

mysql -u [username] -p [dbname] -e [query]

to create the database
mysql -u [username] -p -e "create database somedb"

running the query from the MySQL command line:
 $ mysql -u root -p somedb -e "select * from mytable"
Enter password:


Multiple-line Support

In SQL mode multiple line mode starts when the command \ is issued.
Once multiple-line mode is started, the subsequently entered statements are cached.

For example:
mysql-sql> \
... create procedure get_actors()
... begin
...   select first_name from sakila.actor;
... end



Invoke mysql:
shell> mysql db_name

Or:
shell> mysql --user=user_name --password db_name
Enter password: your_password

<i>mysql -u user_name -p  then press_enter_key
then type password
i.e.
line-1 : mysql -u root -p
line-2 : admin
</i>

<h2><span class="gold">Create MySQL Database, Table & User From Command Line Guide</span></h2>
<a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/managing-mysql-databases-and-users-from-the-command-line">managing mysql databases and users from the command line</a>
<br>

<h3>Create MySQL&nbsp;Databases&nbsp;and Users</h3>

To create MySQL database and users, follow these steps:

At the command line, log in to MySQL as the root user:
mysql -u root -p

Type the MySQL root password, and then press Enter.

To create a database user, type the following command. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>username</em></span> with the user you want to create, and replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>password</em></span> with the user&#39;s password:<br />GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &#39;username&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;password&#39;;

<div class="note">
This command grants the user all permissions. However, you can grant specific permissions to maintain precise control over database access. For example, to explicitly grant the <strong>SELECT</strong> permission, you would use the following command:
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO &#39;username&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39;;

For more information about setting MySQL database permissions, please visit <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/grant.html">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/grant.html</a>.

Type <span class="user-input">\q</span> to exit the <em>mysql</em> program.

To log in to MySQL as the user you just created, type the following command. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>username</em></span> with the name of the user you created in step 3:<br />mysql -u username -p

Type the user&#39;s password, and then press Enter.

To create a database, type the following command. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>dbname</em></span> with the name of the database that you want to create:<br />CREATE DATABASE dbname;

To work with the new database, type the following command. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>dbname</em></span> with the name of the database you created in step 7:<br />USE dbname;

You can now work with the database. For example, the following commands demonstrate how to create a basic table named <em>example</em>, and how to insert some data into it:<br />CREATE TABLE example ( id smallint unsigned not null auto_increment, name varchar(20) not null, constraint pk_example primary key (id) );&#10;INSERT INTO example ( id, name ) VALUES ( null, &#39;Sample data&#39; );&#10;

<h5>Using SQL script files</h5>

The previous procedure demonstrates how to create and populate a MySQL database by typing each command interactively with the <em>mysql</em> program. However, you can streamline the process by combining commands into a SQL script file.

The following procedure demonstrates how to use a SQL script file to create and populate a database:

As in the previous procedure, you should first create a user for the database. To do this, type the following commands:
mysql -u root -p&#10;GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &#39;username&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;password&#39;;&#10;\q&#10;

Create a file named <em>example.sql</em> and open it in your preferred text edtior. Copy and paste the following text into the file:<br />CREATE DATABASE <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>dbname</em></span>;&#10;USE <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>dbname</em></span>;&#10;CREATE TABLE <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tablename</em></span> ( id smallint unsigned not null auto_increment, name varchar(20) not null, constraint pk_example primary key (id) );&#10;INSERT INTO <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tablename</em></span> ( id, name ) VALUES ( null, &#39;Sample data&#39; );

Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>dbname</em></span> with the name of the database that you want to create, and <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tablename</em></span> with the name of the table that you want to create.<br /><div class="note">You can modify the sample script file to create multiple databases and tables all at once. Additionally, the sample script creates a very simple table. You will likely have additional data requirements for your tables.
Save the changes to the <em>example.sql</em> file and exit the text editor.

To process the SQL script, type the following command. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>username</em></span> with the name of the user you created in step 1:<br />mysql -u username -p &lt; example.sql

The <em>mysql</em> program processes the script file statement by statement. When it finishes, the database and table are created, and the table contains the data you specified in the <strong>INSERT</strong> statements.


<h3>Delete&nbsp;MySQL Tables and Databases</h3>

To delete a table, type the following command from the <strong>mysql&gt;</strong> prompt. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tablename</em></span> with the name of the table that you want to delete:
DROP TABLE tablename;

<div class="note">This command assumes that you have already selected a database by using the <strong>USE</strong> statement.

Similarly, to delete an entire database, type the following command from the <strong>mysql&gt;</strong> prompt. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>dbname</em></span> with the name of the database that you want to delete:
DROP DATABASE dbname;

<div class="warning">The <em>mysql</em> program does not ask for confirmation when you use this command. As soon as you press Enter, MySQL deletes the database and all of the data it contains.

<h3>Delete MySQL&nbsp;Users</h3>

To view a list of all users, type the following command from the <strong>mysql&gt;</strong> prompt:
SELECT user FROM mysql.user GROUP BY user;

To delete a specific user, type the following command from the <strong>mysql&gt;</strong> prompt. Replace <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>username</em></span> with the name of the user that you want to delete:
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user = &#39;username&#39;;

<h2><span class="pink">R SQLite</span></h2>
Embeds the SQLite database engine in R, providing a DBI-compliant interface. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> is a public-domain, single-user, very light-weight database engine that implements a decent subset of the SQL 92 standard, including the core table creation, updating, insertion, and selection operations, plus transaction management.
You can install the latest released version of RSQLite from CRAN with:
<code>install.packages("RSQLite")</code>
Or install the latest development version from GitHub with:
<code># install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstats-db/RSQLite")</code>
To install from GitHub, you’ll need a <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites">development environment</a>.
