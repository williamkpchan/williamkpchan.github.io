<h2>About Inkscape</h2>
<p>Inkscape: Introduction</p>
<p><strong>Inkscape</strong> is an <strong>open source</strong> drawing tool for creating and editing <strong>SVG</strong> graphics. <br>More than just a text <strong>vector editor</strong>, Inkscape provides a <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> interface for manipulation of <strong>vector images</strong>, allowing the artist to express himself freely. <br>While other free and proprietary software with similar capabilities exists, Inkscape provides an interface to directly manipulate the underlying SVG code. <br>This allows one to be certain that the code complies to <strong>W3C</strong> standards. <br>Since the beginning of its development, the Inkscape project has been very active, providing stability for the current software and the capacity for future growth.</p>
<p>Like other drawing programs, Inkscape offers creation of basic shapes (such as ellipses, rectangles, stars, polygons, and spirals) as well as the ability to transform and manipulate these basic shapes by <strong>rotation</strong>, <strong>stretching,</strong> and <strong>skewing</strong>.</p>
<p>Inkscape also allows users to manipulate objects precisely by adjusting <strong>node points</strong> and curves. <br>Advanced artists find these functions indispensable in drawing software to freely create what they imagine.</p>
<p>A user can either manipulate the properties of objects individually and precisely through the <strong>XML</strong> editor or, in a more general and intuitive fashion, with input devices such as mice, pen tablets, and even touch screens.</p>
<p>In addition, Inkscape allows one to insert text and <strong>bitmaps</strong> (such as <strong>PNG</strong>—another W3C recommended bitmap image format) into an image, as well as perform some basic editing functions on them. <br>If an artist requires further bitmap editing, he may use other tools (such as the <strong>GIMP</strong>) on images before or after importing them. <br>If one does edit a linked bitmap in another program, Inkscape will reflect these changes once the SVG file is reloaded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of these characteristics make Inkscape a model drawing application, especially considering its flexibility and many other capabilities. <br>Its strict compliance with the W3C SVG standards allows excellent portability of images to many applications and the varying platforms on which these applications run.</p>
   

<h2>About SVG</h2>
<p>Inkscape: AboutSVG</p>
<p>Those who work with graphics for internet use know the problems inherent to publishing images on the web. <br>Traditionally, the only options for use in internet documents were <strong>bitmap </strong>images (such as <strong>JPG</strong> or <strong>GIF</strong>), with the disadvantage that these images are either too large for quick transfer or of poor quality due to high compression.</p>
<p>As a solution to this problem, <strong>Macromedia</strong> created the <strong>Flash</strong> image format. <br>While Flash satisfactorily solved the main problems inherent to bitmap images, some users found it unacceptable that they depended solely on Macromedia to develop the file format and software for the internet-standard <strong>vector format</strong>. <br>In order to address this discontent and provide an open option for vector graphics, the <strong>W3C</strong> created the <strong>SVG</strong> file format, making a freely usable vector format available to everyone.</p>
<p>For most image files, only the specific software that renders the actual image can read them. <br>SVG, however, is described in <strong>XML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, and its files can be opened and edited in any <strong>ASCII</strong> text editor. <br>Though one could create SVG images in this manner, it is highly unproductive and unintuitive. <br>SVG editors and renderers have the ability to easily open and manipulate SVG files without a special interpreter.</p>
<h3>Objectives of the SVG Format</h3>
<p>The advantages of SVG are the same as for any vector image. <br>They offer smooth, crisp, high-quality images with the ability to resize to any dimensions without diminishing quality, all impossible with bitmap images. <br>The SVG standard also defines animation, and with a little use of <strong>Javascript</strong>, one can make SVG interactive. <br>Finally, since SVG is written in XML, a designer can create graphics based on data stored in other XML-based formats, such as graphs, charts and maps. <br>Despite its benefits, SVG lacks a large choice in usable software that takes full advantage of its capabilities. <br>For this reason, SVG is not as usable, at the moment, as Flash.</p>
<h3>The Current State of SVG Software</h3>
<p>Today, a number of software applications, both free and proprietary, can create SVG files: Inkscape, Sketch/Skencil, sK1, Karbon14, xfig, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Xara, and any ASCII text editor.</p>
<p>Although not well supported by most web browsers, Mozilla (Firefox, Netscape) and other browsers such as Safari and Konqueror currently support a basic subset of SVG, and Internet Explorer uses plugins (i.e. <br>Renesis) which support most of the SVG standard. <br>Amaya has good support for SVG display, including animations, and can also perform basic editing tasks. <br></p>
<p>The Batik toolkit is a very useful tool for SVG display, and is often used as a reference for checking SVG implementations.</p>
   

<title>Inkscape: Interface</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Inkscape Interface</h2>
<p>The <strong>Inkscape</strong> interface is constituted of elements designed to make work simple, harmonious and contextual. <br>It is composed principally of a single window in which one creates and manipulates drawings. <br>Within the window, lie particular components which this chapter will identify, enabling readers to easily navigate the software.
</p>
<p><img alt="Inkscape Interface Overview" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-inkscape_window_overview_3-en.png"> 
</p>
<p> We may divide the window into nine major areas:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the <strong>Menu</strong> (at the top of the window)</li>
  <li>the <strong>Commands Bar</strong> </li>
  <li>the <strong>Snap Controls Bar</strong>
</li>
  <li>the <strong>Rulers</strong>, <strong>Guides</strong> and <strong>Grids</strong>
</li>
  <li>the <strong>Tool Controls Bar </strong>(also called just <strong>Controls Bar</strong>) <strong></strong>
</li>
  <li>the <strong>Toolbox</strong>
</li>
  <li>the <strong>Canvas</strong>
</li>
  <li>the <strong>Color Palette</strong><strong></strong>
</li>
  <li>the <strong>Status Bar </strong><strong></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The many toolbars that are available in Inkscape can take up a lot of visual space on your screen. <br>To reduce the toolbar size. <br>Use<em> File &gt; Inkscape Preferences...</em> then select the <strong>Interface</strong> option. <br>Here you can individually set the Commands Bar Icon Size, the Tool Controls Bar Icon Size and the Main toolbar Icon Size.
  <br></p>
<h3>The Menu</h3>
<p> <img title="topbar" alt="topbar" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-topbar-en.png"></p>
<p>As in most <strong>GTK</strong> applications, the Inkscape Menu contains the essential functions of any program, those which concern the application itself: <span class="green">New</span>, <span class="green">Open</span>, <span class="green">Save</span>, <span class="green">Export</span>, <span class="green">Quit</span>, etc. <br>The Menu also consists of functions related to drawing. <br>
  <br></p>
<h3>The Commands Bar</h3>
<p> <img alt="barrecommandes.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-_index-Manual-Manual_fr-resized_600x20_barrecommandes-en.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Commands Bar</strong> is located at the top of the workspace directly underneath the Menu. <br>It contains icons which are shortcuts to commands otherwise accessible from the menus or shortcut keys. <br>It also houses other controls for manipulating the document and drawing objects. <br>For example, from the Commands Bar one can open a new or existing document, print, import an image, undo previous commands, zoom, open the dialog to adjust document properties, etc. <br>Hovering the mouse cursor over each icon will display its functions through <strong>tooltips</strong>.
</p>
<p>There may be an arrow on the right side of the Commands Bar pointing down. <br>Clicking this will reveal any command shortcuts that unable to fit on the bar due to monitor size or resolution settings.
</p>
<p><img title="overflow" alt="overflow" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-overflow-en.png"> 
</p>
<h3>The Toolbox and Tool Controls Bar</h3>
<p><img title="outils" alt="outils" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-outils-en.png"><br></p>
<p>The <strong>Toolbox</strong>, consisting of vertically aligned buttons located on the left of the window, is Inkscape's main editing control. <br>It contains the basic set of drawing utilities, particularly those for creating and editing <strong>shapes</strong>. <br>There are controls for geometric shapes as well as <strong>free-form</strong> shapes and lines, text, and <strong>fills</strong> (colors and <strong>gradients</strong>).
</p>
<p>Located directly under the Commands Bar is the <strong>Tool Controls Bar</strong>. <br>
  <br></p>
<p><img title="toolbar_1" alt="toolbar_1" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-toolbar_1-en.png"></p>
<p>Selecting a tool in the Toolbox changes the Tool Controls Bar to show particular options associated with that tool. <br>Depending on context, some of these options affect a selected <strong>object</strong> while some take effect only when drawing a new object; others can affect either existing or new objects.
</p>
<h3>The Canvas</h3>
<p> <img alt="canevas.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-_index-Manual-Manual_fr-resized_600x327_canevas-en.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Canvas</strong> is the main workspace. <br>It is the most central and important part of the interface since a user creates and views drawings there. <br>It occupies the middle of the window and is represented as a blank "page" surrounded by open space. <br>By default, rulers measuring <strong>pixels</strong> (the standard <strong>SVG</strong> unit) run above and to the left of the Canvas, but one can adjust these defaults (<em>ruler visibility</em> and <em>unit</em>) in <span class="green">Document Properties</span>.
</p>
<p>While the "page" defines the boundaries of a document intended for certain media (print, export, etc.), the page boundaries do not limit the actual SVG image. <br>In fact, users may make the page border and shadow invisible in the <span class="green">Document Properties</span>. <br>Some artists prefer to use a particular page boundary and use the white space as "scratch paper"; others prefer not to be limited by page boundaries.
</p>
<h3> Rulers</h3>
<p>The <strong>Rulers</strong> are graduated lines placed on top and left of the canvas. <br>The first is called "horizontal" and the second "vertical". <br>Graduations represent distances and are expressed in units that can be set in the <em>Units option</em> of the <em>Page tab</em> of the <em><span class="green">File</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Document Properties </span></em><span class="blue">menu command</span><em><span class="blue"></span>. <br></em>
</p>
<p>When the mouse is over the canvas, two triangles appear in the rulers to show its X and Y coordinates, relative to the page's bottom left corner. <br>Those coordinates are also displayed in the Status Bar (at the bottom of the document window) on the right, near the Zoom Control.
</p>
<div class="tips">
<strong>Note : </strong> In SVG, coordinates begin at the bottom left of the document like in <strong>Cartesian geometry</strong>.
</div>
<p><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">R</span></strong> is a quick way to hide or display the Rulers. <br>One can also do that with the <em><span class="green">View</span></em>&gt;<em><span class="blue">Show/Hide</span></em>&gt;<em><span class="blue">Rulers </span></em><span class="blue">menu command.</span>
</p> <img title="regles" alt="regles" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-_index-Manual-Manual_fr-resized_600x385_regles-en.png"><h3>Guides</h3>
<p> <strong>Guides</strong> are user-defined 'magnetic' lines. <br>Using Guides makes object alignment easy even with the mouse. <br>To use Guides, click and drag from the Rulers to the point where the Guide is to be inserted and release. <br>Clicking and dragging from the horizontal Ruler produces a horizontal Guide. <br>Clicking and dragging from the vertical Ruler produces a vertical Guide.
</p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
        <h5>Moving Guides
       </h5>
<blockquote>
  <div class="simplesect" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
    <div class="titlepage">
      <div>
        <div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>When the Selector Tool <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F1</span></strong> is active, passing the mouse over a Guide will change its color to red. <br>Then, click and drag the Guide where you want.
    </p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
        <h5>Deleting guides
       </h5>
<blockquote>
  <div class="simplesect" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
    <div class="titlepage">
      <div>
        <div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>To delete a guide, just drag it to the appropriate Ruler with the Selector Tool <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F1</span></strong>
      <br></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h5>Guide Visibility</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>To make Guides invisible, without deleting them, select <em><span class="green">View</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Guides</span></em> from the Menu Bar. <br>The keyboard shortcut for toggling Guide visibility is <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> <strong><em><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">|</span> </em></strong>(hold shift and press the pipe - <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">|</span></strong> - key, which is usually paired with the backslash key.)
  </p>
  <p> <img title="GuidePrefsEN" alt="GuidePrefsEN" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-UI-GuidePrefsEN-en.png"><br><br><br><em><span class="green">File</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Document properties</span></em> lets you define if Guides should be displayed by default, and the color of both the Guide itself and the highlight when the mouse is passing over.
  </p>
  <p>Guides are also often used with snapping making it much easier to place objects on the canvas, especially for precise or technical drawings. <br>In this case just check the <em><span class="blue">Snap guides while dragging</span></em> checkbox.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Grids</h3>
<p>Instead of using lots of Guides, it can be useful to activate <strong>Grids</strong>. <br>Do this with the <em><span class="green">View</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Grid</span></em> menu or press # (<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">3</span></strong> ).
  <br></p>
<p>Grids are of 2 types : rectangular and <strong>axonometric</strong>. <br>They can be defined in the window from the   <em><span class="green">File</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Document properties</span></em> menu. <br>Most commonly used is the rectangular Grid which is made of vertical and horizontal lines.
</p>
<p> Axonometric Grids allow the user to define any kind of angled Grid which can be interesting for technical or architectural drawings.
</p>
<p> <img title="GridRectPrefsEN" alt="GridRectPrefsEN" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-UI-GridRectPrefsEN-en.png"><br></p>Here is an example of a standard axonometric grid and a rectangular grid.
<br><p><img title="grilles" alt="grilles" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-_index-Manual-Manual_fr-resized_600x315_grilles-en.png"><br></p>
<h4>How to Us</h4>
<p>Use the drop down list in the <em>"</em>Document Properties" dialog to select which type of grid to use then click the "New" button. <br>A new tab is created under "Defined grids" (several grids can be defined for a single document). <br>Then define the units you would like to use and both the Origin point and the distance (Spacing) between two lines of the Grid. <br>When using Axonometric Grids there is also the option to define the angle of two grid lines.
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Enabled</strong> </h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tick the box to use this grid in the current document. <br>Can be left 'on' in invisible grids to maintain snap to grid controls.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Visible</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tick to display the grid on the canvas. <br>Switch off to make the grid invisible. <br>This option sets the default value for each grid so that even if Visible is ticked here, it is still possible to toggle View Grid on and off via the menu or by hitting the # key. <br>If the <em>View &gt; Grid</em> menu is unchecked, the grid won't be visible on the canvas even if "Visible" is checked here.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Grid Units</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Many commonly used units are available from mm, to feet and px. <br>Choose the one that best suits your needs. <br>If no special needs, keep the default px.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Origin X and Y</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Defines the beginning point of the Grid. <br>Usually set to '0' (zero) it can be useful to change these if an offset is needed, especially to define margins from the edge of the Canvas.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Spacing X and Y</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Defines the space between two lines of the Grid. <br>These spaces can be different for horizontal and vertical lines so that the Grid pattern can be set to any kind of rectangle.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Angle X and Z</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Only available for Axonometric Grids. <br>Defines the the angles for the Grid Lines on the X and Z axes.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Grid line color</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>The default color for the Grid is blue, but this can be changed here. <br>There are two kinds of line. <br>The most often used is the Grid line, but when the grid spacing is short and many lines are displayed the Major Grid line helps to evaluate distances. <br>In this case a different color can be defined for each type of line and the frequency of the Major Grid line can be set (usually 5 or 10).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5> <strong>Show dots instead of lines</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Available on Rectangular Grid Only. <br>Since lines can overload the screen, it can be uneasy working with Drawing Tools when the grid is visible. <br>This option toggles between lines and dots for displaying the grid, creating a less overloaded screen.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Snap Controls Bar</h3>
<p> <img alt="snapping_toolbar.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-snapping_toolbar-en.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Snap Controls Bar</strong> gives easy access to object snapping enabling you to quickly turn snapping on when required and the off when finished. <br>It also allows customisation of the snapping feature letting you select what can be snapped and what objects can snap to.
  <br></p>
<h3>Color Palette</h3>
<p><img title="palette" alt="palette" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-_index-Manual-Manual_fr-resized_600x17_palette-en.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Color Palette</strong> is a quick way to apply color to shapes. <br>It is displayed at the bottom of the Canvas, or can be opened in a window by selecting <em><span class="blue">View</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Swatches</span></em> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">W</span></strong> )
</p>
<h4>How to Us</h4>
<p>To find the color you like, just scroll along the swatch line and choose. <br>You can change the color palette with another preset by clicking the triangle at the right of the bar and choosing one.
</p>
<p>To apply a color to a shapes "Fill color", just click on a color after selecting one or more shapes.
</p>
<p>To apply color to the "Stroke", press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> while clicking and it's done.
  <br></p>
<h3>Status Bar</h3>
<p><img title="status_bar" alt="status_bar" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/the-inkscape-interface/static/Inkscape-Interface-resized_600x17_status_bar-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>Status Bar is the bottom-most area of the Inkscape interface. <br>It includes (from left to right) :
</p>
<ul>
<li>Color indicator for the object</li>
  <li>Quick layer selector</li>
  <li>Help message area</li>
  <li>Mouse Coordinate indicator</li>
  <li>and finally a Zoom Factor in which one can write the exact zoom factor they want to use.
  <br>
</li>
</ul>
<title>Inkscape: WorkingwithFiles</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Working with files</h2>
<h3>Creating a New Document</h3>
<p>Creating a new document is usually the first step to creating art in Inkscape. <br>While you can always begin with an existing document, it is likely that a blank document is more useful for a new drawing.
</p>
<p>New documents, themselves, are created from an existing document (also known as a template) which exists in the user's profile. <br>A standard template file comes with a new installation, but a user can modify it, just like any Inkscape file, to suit his or her preferences. <br>In addition to the standard template, there is a selection of other templates representing various media types; this list can be extended with additional templates created by the user.
</p>
<p>When Inkscape starts, a new document is automatically created from the standard template. <br>If a new document is created from an existing instance of Inkscape, a new Inkscape window is opened.
</p>
<h4>How to Use</h4>
<p>One can create a new file in several ways:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
  <p>Select <span class="green">File</span><span class="guimenuitem"> </span><span class="guimenuitem">&gt; </span><em><span class="blue"><span class="guimenuitem"></span><span class="guimenuitem"></span>New</span></em> from the menu bar (opens a list of all available templates with <em>Default</em> at the top)
  </p> </li>
  <li>
  <p><span class="emphasis">Press</span><span><strong class="keycap keyboard_shortcuts"> Ctrl</strong></span><span><strong class="keycap"> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">N</span></strong></span> (creates a new document from the default template)
  </p> </li>
  <li>Click the <em>New Document</em> icon on the <strong>Commands Bar</strong> (also creates a new document from the default template)
</li>
</ul>
<p>To modify document properties (such as page size, default units, etc.), select <em><span class="green">File<span class="guimenuitem"></span></span></em><span class="guimenuitem"> &gt;</span> <em><span class="blue">Document Properties</span></em> from the menu or press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + D</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Opening a Document</h3>
<div class="simplesect" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
  <p>Instead of creating a new file one may wish to open an existing <strong>SVG</strong> document. <br>This process can be useful for:
  </p>
  <div class="itemizedlist">
    <ul type="disc">
<li>
      <p>modifying an existing document;
      </p> </li>
      <li>
      <p>getting some part of a document to reuse it for another one;
      </p> </li>
      <li>
      <p>analyzing the method used to create a picture, especially by viewing the code in the Inkscape <strong>XML</strong> <strong>source code</strong> editor;
      </p> </li>
      <li>
      <p>exporting the document in a new <strong>format</strong>.
      </p>
</li>
    </ul>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
    <p>There are a couple of methods for opening files:
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>
<em>Open...</em> - Opens a file in a new window for editing, making any work carried out totally independent from concurrently open documents. <br></li>
      <ul>
<li>
<span class="emphasis">Select</span> <em><span class="green">File<span class="guimenuitem"></span></span></em><span class="guimenuitem"> &gt;<em><span class="blue"><span class="accel"> O</span>pen</span></em></span> from the menu </li>
        <li>
<span class="emphasis">Press </span><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="emphasis"></span><span><strong class="keycap">Ctrl</strong></span></span><strong> + </strong><span><strong class="keycap"><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">O</span></strong></span>
</li>
        <li>
<span class="emphasis">Click</span> the <em>Open</em> icon on the <strong>Commands Bar</strong> <span><strong class="keycap"><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"></span></strong></span>
</li>
      </ul>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Import...</em> - Imports a file into the currently active document you are working on. <br>The imported file becomes an object in the already open document. <br></li>
  <ul>
<li>Select <em>File &gt; Import...</em>
</li>
    <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + I</strong>
</li>
    <li>Click the <em>Import</em> icon on the <strong>Commands Bar</strong> </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul type="disc"><ul></ul></ul>
<p>It is possible to exchange objects from one document to another by <strong>copy</strong>/<strong>paste</strong>, but only if the newly opened document was opened from within the original application instance. <br>For example, if a file was opened by double clicking its icon from the computer's file browser, a second instance of Inkscape would be opened and objects could not be exchanged between documents.
</p>
<ul></ul>
<div class="tips">While Inkscape can import several different file types, it only works with SVG files; therefore, every file is translated to SVG upon import. <br>This means that some data loss and change may occur upon import.
<p></p>
</div>
<h3>Saving a Document</h3>
<div class="simplesect" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
  <p>There are several methods of saving files:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>
<em class="blue"><span class="guimenuitem">Save</span></em> - saves the existing document using the current file name. <br>If the document is new and has not yet been saved, a dialog will open asking the user to specify a file name and location.</li>
    <ul>
<li>Select <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Save</em> from the menu </li>
      <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + S</strong>
</li>
      <li>Click the <em>Save Document</em> icon on the <strong>Command</strong><strong>s Bar</strong> </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<strong>
  <p>
  </p></strong>

  <h4>Commonly Used File Formats</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>
<strong><span class="term">.svg</span></strong></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There are several versions of the SVG file format available to Inkscape:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Inkscape svg</strong> is Inkscapes default format which keeps every shape as easily editable as possible.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Plain svg</strong> is the recommended SVG format for use outside Inkscape. <br>It is fully compliant with <strong>W3C</strong>'s spec. <br>In this format, many of the shapes (especially <strong>primitives</strong>) will be transformed to paths.<strong> </strong>
        <br><br><strong>Adobe Illustrator svg</strong> (<strong>Adobe Illustrator 9+</strong>) is the svg format exported from <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, with its specification. <br>For those who have to work with <strong>proprietary software</strong> users. <br><em>Note: these files are labeled <strong>.ai.svg</strong> and Inkscape is only able to open/import them.</em>

<title>Inkscape: SelectorTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Select Tool</h2>
<p>The<strong> Select</strong> <strong>Tool</strong> <span class="guiicon"></span>is used to select, position and transform objects on the <strong>Canvas</strong> with the mouse or other input device.
</p>
<h3>How to Use
  <br></h3>
<p class="spip">Start the Select Tool one of three ways:
  <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Select Tool button in the Toolbox;</li>
  <li>Press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">s</span></strong>;</li>
  <li>Press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F1</span></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Select a Single Object</h4>
<p>Click an object with the <strong>Select Tool</strong> <span class="guiicon"></span>to select it. <br>The object will be framed with a bounding box (a black, dashed line) and scale <strong>handles</strong> will appear. <br>Click again on the same object and the scale handles will change to rotation and skew handles.
</p>
<p>If the object clicked is part of a group, the group will be selected, and any actions performed will affect the entire group as if it were one object. <br>Double-clicking a group will allow you to subsequently select individual objects within the group.
  <br></p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4> Add Objects to and Remove Objects from Selection</h4>
<blockquote><dl><dt>
  <div>
    <p> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+Click</strong> objects to add them to the current selection or to remove them from the selection.
    </p>
  </div>
</dt></dl></blockquote>
<h4>Select Objects Under other Objects</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong></strong> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+click</strong> selects the object under the cursor which is below (in z-order) the currently selected object under the cursor; if the bottom object is reached, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span><strong>+click</strong> again selects the top object. <br>Thus, several <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+<strong>clicks</strong> will cycle selection through the z-order stack at the click point.
  </p>
  <p>Combining <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span></strong> with <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> ("select in groups") and <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> ("add to selection") works, too. <br><em>(Note that on Linux, many window managers steal <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+click</strong> by default; reconfigure your WM so you can use <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+click</strong> in Inkscape.)</em>
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rubberband Selection</h4>
<p><strong></strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <div>
    <p>Select multiple objects by clicking on empty canvas space (or over objects which are <strong>unselectable</strong>) and dragging the rectangular "rubber band" over several objects (i.e. <br>click at one place and keep the button pressed while moving the mouse).
    </p>
    <p><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+Click+Drag</strong> will start the Rubberband Selection over any object.
    </p>
    <p><img title="rubberband_selection" alt="rubberband_selection" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-rubberband_selection-en.png"><br></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Touch Selection</h4>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Alt+Click+Drag</strong> will allow you to select objects by drawing a freehand path (indicated by a red line); anything which the path touches will become part of the selection when you release the mouse button. <br>This mode is convenient in situations where you need to select objects so intermingled that selecting them by the other methods is too difficult or tedious.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p><em> (Note that your selection must be empty, otherwise<strong> <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span></strong> dragging will move the selected objects instead.)</em>
    </p>
    <p><img title="Touch selection" alt="Touch selection" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-touch_selection-en.png"> 
    </p>
    <p>To start a touch selection from a point over an object, or to add to existing selection by touching, press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><span>+</span><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> and then start to drag.
    </p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4>Invert Selection
  <br></h4>
<blockquote>
  <div>Use <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">!</span></strong> to invert the selection to all unselected objects within the current layer; use <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">!</span></strong> to invert the selection to all unselected objects within all unlocked layers.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Move
  <br></h4>
<blockquote>
  <div>To move a selection with the mouse, click an object and hold the mouse button while dragging to the new location.
  </div>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div>
<em>(Dragging an object or several objects while holding <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span></span> enables you to keep them aligned on an axis using the snap options.)</em>
    <br>
</div>
  <p>Move a selection <em>precisely</em> with the Select Tool either of two ways:
    <br></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>Press the keyboard's cursor arrows to move selection 2 pixels in the direction of the arrow; <strong>Shift+Cursor</strong> will move by steps of 20 pixels; <strong>Alt+Cursor</strong> will move it by steps of one screen pixel, which will vary the actual movement based on zoom factor. <br>(The default step can be changed in <strong><span class="green">Inkscape Preferences</span></strong>.)</li>
    <li>Change the coordinates in the <strong>Tool Controls Bar</strong> X and Y coordinate boxes. <br></li>
  </ul>
<div>
    <p><img title="x_y_coords_en" alt="x_y_coords_en" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-x_y_coords_en-en.png"><br></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Transform</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are two modes within the Select Tool which are used to transform objects: <em>scale</em> and <em>shear/rotate</em> modes.
  </p>
  <p>You can switch between modes by clicking the current selection or pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>S</strong></span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Scale</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Scaling</strong> an object resizes it vertically, horizontally or both.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <div>To resize a selection in <em>scale</em> mode, drag the handles at the corners or press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">&lt;</span></strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">&gt;</span></strong> (the factor for key scaling can be set in <span class="green">Inkscape Preferences</span>).
  </div>
  <p><img title="handles_resize" alt="handles_resize" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-handles_resize-en.png"><br></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>You may also scale a selection by adjusting the parameters of the <em>width<strong> </strong></em>and <em>height</em> boxes on the <span class="green">Tool Controls</span> bar
    </p>
    <p><img title="width_height_locked_en" alt="width_height_locked_en" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-width_height_locked_en-en.png"><br></p>
  </div>
  <p>To constrain the proportion of the selection while resizing, select the lock toggle on the Tool Controls Bar or hold <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> while dragging.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div>To use the center point of the object as the center of the transformation, hold <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong>.
    <br>
</div>
  <p>
  </p>Dragging the scale handles with<strong> </strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> scales the selection by an integer factor, i.e. <br>up to <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, etc. <br>times the original size or down to <strong>1/2</strong>. <br><strong>1/3</strong>, <strong>1/4</strong>, etc. <br>of the original size either horizontally or vertically (or both). <br><em>(In some Linux distributions, you may need to adjust your meta-key settings to make this work.)</em>
</blockquote>
<div>
</div>
<h5>Rotate</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div>To rotate a selection, switch to shear/rotate mode and drag the arrow handles which are found at the corners or press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">[</span></strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">]</span></strong>.
    <br>
</div>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p><img title="handles_rotate" alt="handles_rotate" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-handles_rotate-en.png"><br></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>Constrain rotations to 15 degree increments by holding <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> while rotating.
    </p>
    <p>To rotate the selection around the opposite bounding box corner location, hold <strong>Shift</strong> while rotating.
      <br></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rotation Center</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>Rotation Center</strong> of the selection specifies the point around which it rotates. <br>The Rotation Center is marked with a crosshairs and may be placed anywhere on the canvas (not just within the <strong>bounding box</strong> of the object).
  </p>
  <p>When several objects are selected, they use the Rotation Center of the <em>first selected object</em>. <br>If the first object does not have center set (i.e. <br>if it is in a default central position), then several objects will rotate around the geometric center of their common bounding box
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>To move the rotation center of an object, click and drag it to the desired spot. <br>It will snap to the bounding box of the object as well as other <strong>snap points</strong> as set in the <span class="green">Preferences</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Compare rotation around center which is in it default position
    </p>
    <p><img title="rotation_center_01" alt="rotation_center_01" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-rotation_center_01-en.png"> 
    </p>
    <p>with rotation around center which is moved to upper right corner of a shape:
    </p>
    <p><img title="rotation_center_02" alt="rotation_center_02" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-rotation_center_02-en.png"><br></p>
  </div>
  <div>
<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+click</strong> on the rotation center resets it back to the center of the object's box.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Skew or Shear</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong></strong>To shift the parallel bounding edges of the selection in opposite directions so that the selection is warped diagonally, drag on the shearing handles at the top, bottom or sides of the selection while in shear/rotate mode.
    <br></p>
  <div>
    <p><img title="handles_shear" alt="handles_shear" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-handles_shear-en.png"></p>
<img title="shearing" alt="shearing" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-shearing-en.png"><br><br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Flip</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Flip a selection either vertically or horizontally by
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>clicking the <strong>Flip</strong> buttons on the <strong>Tool Controls Bar</strong>
</li>
    <li>selecting <strong>Object-&gt;Flip Vertical</strong> or <strong>Object-&gt;Flip Horizontal</strong>
</li>
    <li>pressing <strong>v</strong> or <strong>h</strong>
    <br>
</li>
  </ul>
<p>Flipping a selection while in <em>scale</em> mode makes it flip within its bounding box, so that the bounding box remains fixed:
  </p>
  <p><img title="rotation_shear_01" alt="rotation_shear_01" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/select-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-selector-rotation_shear_01-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p>However, in <em>rotate/shear</em> mode flipping happens over an axis through the rotation center:

  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Scale Stroke Width, Rectangle Corners and Fills
  <br></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> There are four preferences that control whether to transform <em>stroke widths</em>, <em>rectangle corners</em>, <em>gradient fills</em>, and <em>pattern fills</em> when a selection is transformed.
  </p>
  <p>They are represented by four toggle buttons in the <strong>Tool Controls Bar</strong>. <br>Be sure to select the appropriate toggles before transforming any selection.
  </p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>
  <p>Double-clicking an object with the Select Tool <span class="guiicon"></span>and the tool will activate the appropriate tool to edit the object (i.e., if you double-click an ellipse, the Ellipse Tool will be activated, etc.).
  </p>
</li>
  <li>The <span class="green">Transform</span> Window (<span class="blue">Object</span>-&gt;<span class="blue">Transform</span> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">M</span></strong>) can be used for precise transformations. <br></li>
  <li>Press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Esc</span></strong> to cancel selection or cancel an <em>incomplete</em> move or transformation.
  <br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+Click</strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+Click</strong> will select objects within groups from outside that group.<strong></strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Drag Selected</strong>: in Select, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span><strong>+Drag</strong> moves the currently selected object(s) no matter where you start the drag, unlike regular drag that first selects the object under cursor. <br>This is convenient for dragging objects that are behind other objects in z-order. <br><em>(On Linux, you may need to disable dragging the window with <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span></strong> in your window manager's settings if you want to use this "drag selected" method.) </em>
</li>

<title>Inkscape: NodeTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Node Tool </h2>
<p>The Node tool is used to select and manipulate <strong>nodes</strong> so as to be able to precisely modify the shape of <strong>paths</strong> or curves. <br>These paths can be stand alone objects or they can be attached to another object as a  <strong>mask</strong> or <strong>clipping path</strong>. <br> In addition to allowing manipulating of node position, node handles extend from the node when it is selected which define the direction of the path segments originating from that node.
  <br></p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>

<span class="term">
    <p>Selecting Nodes
      <br></p></span></h4>
<span class="term">
  <p>To select an object with the node tool you can <strong>click</strong> on it. <br>Once an object is selected you can then select and edit the individual nodes in the object. <br>clicking on a node selects it, clicking on a path segment between two nodes selects both nodes. <br>If you want to add or remove nodes from the selection use <strong>Shift+Click</strong> to toggle nodes into and out of the selection. <br>You can do a <strong>rubberband</strong> selection around a group of nodes using <strong>Click+Drag</strong> with the mouse. <br>Nodes can also be added and removed from a selection using <strong>Shift+Drag</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>If you need to select all the nodes in a path or sub-path first select any node in the path. <br>If you want to select all the nodes in a path containing 2 or more sub-paths then press <strong>Ctrl+Alt+A</strong>. <br>If you just want to select the sub-path<span class="term"> press <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> to select all nodes in a sub-path (if there are no sub-paths <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> will select the whole path). <br></span>
  </p></span>
  <h4>
<span class="term">
    <p>Moving Nodes and Node Handles
      <br></p></span></h4>
<span class="term">
  <p>Once a node has been selected, it can be moved by <strong>Dragging </strong>the mouse. <br>Use <strong>Ctrl+Drag</strong> to restrict the movement to horizontal or vertical, and <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Drag</strong> to drag along the direction of the node's handles. <br>Nodes can also be moved using the <strong>Arrow keys</strong>. <br>Pressing an <strong>Arrow</strong> by itself will move the selected node(s) by the <strong>Nudge Distance</strong> (The default nudge distance is 2 SVG pixel units). <br>Presshing <strong>Shift+Arrow</strong> moves the node(s) by 10x the Nudge Distance. <br>Pressing <strong>Alt+Arrow</strong> moves the node(s) 1 screen pixel and <strong>Alt+Shift+Arrow</strong> moves the node(s) 10 screen pixels.
  </p>
  <p>Once a node has been selected, it displays it's <strong>handles</strong>. <br>The node handles are used to define the shape of a curve between two nodes. <br>Rotating the node handle changes the direction of the curve as it leaves the node and changing the length of the handle changes the distance the curve will travel before it bends/interacts with the properties of the handle of the next node along the curve.
  </p>
  <p>A node handle can be moved by <strong>Dragging </strong>the mouse. <br>Using <strong>Ctrl+Drag</strong> locks the rotation of the handle to 15 degree steps from 0, as well as snapping to it's original angle and the angle of the opposite node handle. <br> <strong>Shift+Drag</strong> rotates both handles at once and<strong> Alt+Drag</strong>  locks the length of the handle as it is rotated.

  <h4>Manipulating Nodes</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+Click</strong> on a node handle and it will retract back to a length of 0. <br>To pull the handle back out of the node use <strong>Shift+Drag</strong>.
    </p>
    <p> Pressing <strong>[</strong> or <strong>]</strong> keys will rotate the handles around the node by 1 angle step (the default angle is 15 degrees), pressing <strong>Alt+[</strong> or <strong>]</strong> will restrict the rotation to 1 pixel. <br>If the node is a corner or cusp holding the left or right <strong>Ctrl</strong> key while pressing <strong>[</strong> or <strong>]</strong> will restrict the rotation to the left or right node handle,  using the left or right <strong>Alt+</strong><strong>[</strong> or <strong>]</strong> keys wil rotate the left or right handle by 1 pixel.
      <br></p>
    <p>Pressing the <strong>&lt;</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong> keys will increase or decrease the length of the node handles by 1scale step. <br>(the default step is 2 SVG pixel units). <br>For any node type except <strong>symmetric</strong> holding the left or right <strong>Ctrl</strong> key when pressing <strong>&lt;</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong> will restrict the scaling to the right or left node. <br><strong>Alt+</strong><strong>&lt;</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong> will change the scale by 1 screen pixel (as with the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key the handle being scaled depends on which <strong>Alt</strong> key is pressed).<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Rotating</strong> objects or control handles of a node with <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> restricts rotation to 15 degree increments. <br><strong>Dragging</strong> nodes may be restricted to horizontal/vertical with <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> and to the directions of the node's handles (or there perpendiculars) with <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span>. <br><strong>Dragging a node's control points</strong> with <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> locks the length of the handle, and with <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span>, rotates the other handle by the same angle. <br>When <em>several</em> nodes are selected, pressing <strong>&lt;</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong> scales, <strong>[</strong> or <strong>]</strong> rotates the selected nodes <strong>as if they were an “object”</strong>, around the center of that object. <br>So, for example, in a single-path silhouette portrait, you can select the nodes of the nose and rotate/scale the nose as a whole without breaking the path into pieces. <br>Pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> with these keys gives pixel-sized movement depending on zoom, the same as in Selector. <br>Also, you can press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>h</strong></span> or <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>v</strong></span> to flip the selected nodes horizontally or vertically.

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>When an object is selected handles appear making it possible to handle the shape of the object in an intuitive and precise way. <br></li>
  <li>You can switch the not-yet-finalized (red) segment of the path being drawn from curve to line (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span></span> <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap"><strong>L</strong></span></span><span class="keycap"></span>) or back to curve  (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span></span> <span class="keycap"><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">U</span></strong></span>). <br></li>
  <li>
<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Esc</span></strong> deselects, cancels selection, and cancels drag or transformation of any kind (so far only in selector and node edit). <br>Arrows, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>a</strong></span><strong></strong>, and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Tab</strong></span><strong></strong> / <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Tab</strong></span><strong></strong> act on nodes in node editor exactly as they do on objects in Selector. <br>The first <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Escape</strong></span><strong></strong> or empty-space click deselects any selected nodes, the second one deselects the selected object removing the node display. <br></li>
  <li>The Node Tool selects objects regardless of grouping. <br>This means you don't need to switch to selector for a <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong></strong>+<strong>click</strong> if you want to edit a grouped path. <br></li>
  <li>You can reverse the direction of selected path(s) either via Path &gt; Reverse or by pressing 'r' in node tool (useful for markers and combining paths). <br></li>
  <li>
<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong>+<strong>click</strong> on a node handle retracts that handle back to its node. <br></li>
  <li>If a node does not show one or both handles (i.e. <br>they are retracted), you can <strong>drag a handle out</strong> by dragging away from the node <strong>with <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>.</strong> </li>
  <li>Pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>A</strong></span> with some nodes selected will select not all nodes in the path but all nodes in the subpath(s) containing the selected node(s). <br>To select all nodes in the path unconditionally, either deselect any nodes before pressing Ctrl+A, or use <em>Select all in all subpaths</em> (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>A</strong></span>) in Node tool. <br></li>
  <li>Edit the selected path by dragging directly on the path. <br></li>
  <li>if you press Shift before starting to drag, you always get a node selection rubberband rectangle </li>
  <li>When you <strong>switch the type</strong> of the selected node to Smooth or Symmetric by pressing <strong></strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>S</strong></span><strong></strong> / <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Y</strong></span><strong></strong>, you can now <strong>preserve the position</strong> of one of the two handles by hovering your mouse over it, so that only the other handle is rotated/scaled to match. <br></li>
  <li>You can <strong>grow or shrink node selection</strong> by hovering the mouse pointer over a node and using <strong>mousewheel</strong> (up = grow, down = shrink) or the keys <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>PageUp</strong></span> (grow) and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>PageDown</strong></span> (shrink). <br><em>Growing</em> adds the closest unselected node to the selection; shrinking deselects the farthest selected node. <br>There are two modes that differ by how the closest/farthest nodes are chosen: </li>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
<li> <strong>Spatial selection</strong> (mousewheel, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>PageUp</strong></span><strong></strong> / <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>PageDown</strong></span><strong></strong>): distances to nodes are measured directly, regardless of which subpath a node belongs to. <br></li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
<li>
<strong>Linear selection</strong> (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<strong>mousewheel</strong>, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">PageUp</span>/<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">PageDown</span>): node distances are measured <em>along the path</em>, and only the nodes belonging to the same subpath as the hovered node are considered (i.e. <br>other subpaths are never selected). <br></li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
  <li>This technique is convenient for quickly selecting an area in a complex path starting from a center - for example, for node sculpting. <br></li>
  <li> If any of the nodes in the currently selected path is mouseovered, then horizontal/vertical flipping ('H' and 'V' keys), stepwise rotation ('[' and ']' keys) and scaling ('&lt;' and '&gt;' keys) now all use this specific node as center/axis. <br>If there is no mouseovered node, the center of the bounding box is used instead (as is currently the case unconditionally). <br>Nodes that are covered by one of their handles are also detected as mouseovered. <br></li>
  <li>Two entry fields are available on the Tool Controls bar which allow precise editing of the coordinates of selected nodes.</li>
  <li>The message, "To join, you must have <strong>two endnodes</strong> selected" warns that the command only works on endnodes. <br>To see if a line segment ends in an endnode, drag the middle of the line. <br>If a closed loop forms, with two paths between two nodes, then the nodes are not endnodes. <br>To convert a node into an endnode, select the line connected to the node by clicking once on the line, click a second time to select one of the overlapping line segments, and click on the <strong>split path</strong> tool to remove one of the line segments.
  <br>

<title>Inkscape: TweakTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2> Tweak Tool</h2>
<p>The Tweak Tool is an exciting way to edit drawings which largely blurs the distinction between <strong>vector</strong> and <strong>raster</strong> editing. <br>Instead of meticulously selecting some objects and then performing an action on the selection, you can select <em>all</em> objects (or all objects you are interested in) and apply the Tweak Tool's <strong>brush</strong> to smoothly and naturally change the shape or style of <em>only those objects</em> (or parts thereof) <em>that the brush touches</em>.
</p>
<p><img alt="tweak_new.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/tweak-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Tweak-tweak_new-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>The editing modes of the Tweak tool fall into 3 different categories: <strong>Path Editing Modes</strong> where the shape of individual paths is modified; <strong>Colour Modes</strong> where the colour of individual objects is modified and <strong>Object Editing Modes</strong> where whole objects are moved, scaled or rotated but their shapes are kept intact.
</p>The area of the tool's action - its <em>brush</em> - is marked by an orange-colored circular outline that moves with your mouse cursor. <br>However, that area actually has no sharp boundaries; the power of the tool's action falls off gradually, following a smooth bell-shaped profile. <br>This makes the tool act softly and smoothly.
<p>The tool will work on any number of selected objects; for example, you can select all <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong> + </strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>A</strong></span> and "smear" your entire drawing by <strong>Push</strong> mode or paint it by <strong>Color Paint </strong>mode. <br>You can also apply it to groups of objects; it will go into groups and act on individual objects inside groups. <br>If you're trying to use it without anything selected, it will remind you by a statusbar message to select some objects.
</p>
<p align="center">
</p>
<h3> How to Use</h3>
<h4>Width</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The width of the tool's brush, in the range from 1 to 100, can be changed by the <strong>Width</strong> control in the tool's controls bar above the <strong>canvas</strong>. <br>You can also change width by <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Left</strong></span> and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Right</strong></span> arrow keys (same as in the <strong>Calligraphy Tool</strong>) at any time (including during action) as well as <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Home</strong></span> and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>End</strong>.</span> Also, as in Calligraphy Tool, the visible width of the brush is independent of zoom; simply zooming in or out is often easier than adjusting the width if you want to cover a smaller or larger area of the drawing.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Force</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The next control is <strong>Force</strong> which adjusts the power of the action, also in the range from 1 to 100. <br>You can also change width by <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Up</strong></span> and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Down</strong></span> arrow keys at any time (including during action).
  </p>
  <p>If you have a pressure-sensitive tablet and your "Use pressure" button on the right-hand end of the controls bar is on, then the force will also depend on how hard you actually press your pen into your tablet, changing in the range from zero to whatever you set in the Force control. <br>If all you have is a mouse, then the force will be constant but still settable by the Force control.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">Path editing modes</span></h4>
<h4></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Tweak tool has a number of <strong>modes</strong>, selectable by toggle buttons in the tool's Controls bar and by keyboard shortcuts. <br>Some of these modes change the shapes of <strong>paths</strong>, others affect the whole object leaving the path shape intact, while still others affect the colors of objects. <br>All these modes share the <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Force</strong> controls but otherwise are quite different. <br>Let's look at the path editing modes first.
  </p>
  <p>Unlike the Node tool, to edit paths with the Tweak tool you don't need to worry about where the nodes of a path are and how to manipulate them. <br>You just apply the tool's brush to any point, and the selected paths at that point will reshape smoothly and naturally - as if made of soft jelly - regardless of where its nodes lie. <br>If applied to a shape or text object, the tool converts them to paths automatically.
  </p>
  <p>While not very useful for technical drawings, tweaking paths will be indispensable for artistic uses of <strong>Inkscape</strong> - cartoons, drawings, sketches, anime, etc. <br>This new functionality is somewhat similar to the tools such as "Pucker" and "Bloat" in the latest versions of <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>There are currently six path editing modes in the Tweak Tool: <strong>Push</strong>, <strong>Shrink/</strong> <strong>Grow</strong>, <strong>Attract/</strong> <strong>Repel</strong>, and <strong>Roughen</strong>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Push</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p> This default mode of the tool, <strong>Push</strong>, <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">P</span></strong> simply displaces the part of the path under the cursor in the direction of the drag. <br>The path behaves like soft jelly, bending and bulging smoothly and naturally. <br>It's an easy way to produce various irregular, lifelike, handmade-looking shapes starting from something as simple as an ellipse or a calligraphic stroke. <br>For parallel-stroke hatching (engraving) done in the Calligraphy tool, pushing is an easy way to bend, pinch, or curve the entire hatching uniformly.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Shrink and Grow</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>Shrink</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">S</span></strong> ) and <strong>Grow</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Hold Shift</span></strong> when using the Tweak Tool) are two opposite modes that move each point of a path in a direction perpendicular to the path's surface at the point, either inwards (Shrink) or outwards (Grow). <br>This is similar to the <strong>Inset</strong> and <strong>Outset</strong> commands, except that the Tweak Tool can act on a part of a path instead of the whole path.
  </p>
  <p>For example, the visible lightness/darkness of an engraving hatching may not exactly correspond to your artistic intention. <br>Also, the ends of Calligraphy pen strokes are often far from ideal - they may be too blunt or have unsightly bends or blobs. <br>This is where the Tweak Tool may help. <br>Select all the strokes in a hatching pattern and apply a light Shrink action where you want the lines to become thinner (and the hatching to become lighter), up until total disappearance. <br>If you press hard, shrinking works as an eraser, so you can easily clean the strokes' ends to make them thin, sharp, and uniform. <br>Conversely, applying Grow makes strokes wider (i.e. <br>the hatching becomes darker).
  </p>
  <p>Of course, shrinking and growing are useful not only for calligraphic strokes. <br>Same as with Push, with Shrink and Grow you can <strong>sculpt</strong> any path, spawning smooth treacle-like appendages with Grow and carving holes with Shrink. <br>Unlike the "node sculpting" mode in the Node tool, however, this does not require adding new nodes to the shape.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Attract</strong> and <strong>Repel</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attract</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong>+ <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">A</span></strong> )and <strong>Repel</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Hold Shift</span></strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"> when applying tool</span>) mode works by moving each affected point on a path towards (Attract) or from (Repel) the cursor point. <br>In some cases this may look similar to Shrink and Grow, but the difference is that shrinking/growing moves paths perpendicularly to the path in each point, whereas attracting/repelling moves them to or from the cursor regardless of the path shape. <br>These modes are similar to the Pinch effect in AI; you can use them for various central-symmetric distortions in parts of your paths.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<strong>Roughen</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p> The <strong>Roughen</strong> (<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> +<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">R</span></strong> ) mode does exactly this: roughens the edge of the path without changing its overall shape. <br>Slight roughening simply makes the edge crooked and uneven; strong roughening tears and explodes the edge into random blobs and splotches.
  </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This operation, especially when applied with high Fidelity, adds a lot of nodes, increasing the size of your SVG document and may slow down Inkscape considerably. <br>In particular, pushing, shrinking, or growing of a roughened path becomes much slower and more difficult. <br>It's recommended to finalise the overall shape of a path first and roughen it, if necessary, only as the final step.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>
<span class="mw-headline">Fidelity</span></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any tweaking of a path slightly distorts the entire path, including even those parts that you didn't touch. <br>These distortions are similar to those that a Simplify command produces. <br>The <strong>Fidelity</strong> value (also in the range from 1 to 100, default is 50) allows you to control the amount of these distortions. <br>With a higher fidelity, the distortions are less noticeable, but the path may end up having a lot of nodes which inflates up the SVG size and slows down Inkscape.
  </p>
  <p>The best value of Fidelity depends on the nature of your artwork. <br>If you're sculpting an amorphous blob, you can do with low fidelity of about 20. <br>If, however, you are pushing or inflating a text string (as a single path) and want the letters outside the distorted area to remain crisp and clean, you will need to raise fidelity to 80 or more.
  </p>

<h4>Object editing modes</h4>
<p>The <strong>Object editing modes</strong><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"></span></strong><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"></span></strong><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"></span></strong><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"></span></strong>, unlike the path editing modes, change the position, size, rotation, etc of objects instead of their shapes. <br>Yet they share enough common features with the path editing modes to be part of the same tool: These modes also use a circular soft-edged brush controlled by the Width and Force parameters on the Controls bar and affected by the pen pressure (if you have a pressure-sensitive tablet).

<h4>Color editing modes</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> The <strong>Color Paint</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">C</span></strong> ) and <strong>Color Jitter</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong>  + <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">J</span></strong> ) modes, unlike the path editing modes, change the colors of objects instead of their shapes. <br>Yet they share enough common features with the path editing modes to be part of the same tool: These modes also use a circular soft-edged brush controlled by the Width and Force parameters on the Controls bar and affected by the pen pressure (if you have a pressure-sensitive tablet).
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> <strong>Color Paint</strong> applies the style of the tool to the selected objects under the brush. <br>The style of the tool is visible in the style swatch at the rightmost end of the tool's control bar; it can be changed by clicking on the color palette or by any other style assignment command, such as Fill and Stroke dialog. <br>(<strong>Note</strong>: unlike all other tools, in Tweak tool in Color Paint mode you cannot assign style directly to selected objects; any style-setting command changes the tool's style instead.) </li>
  </ul>
<dl><dd>The fill from the tool's style applies to the fills of the painted objects, and the stroke applies to the strokes. <br>If the tool's style has no fill or no stroke, it won't affect fills or strokes, correspondingly. <br>For example, if you want to color the fills of objects blue but leave their strokes untouched, assign blue fill to the tool's style (just click blue on the palette) but set its stroke to None (middle-click the Stroke swatch in the statusbar). <br>Similarly, master opacity in the tool's style affects master opacities of the touched objects (if the O channel is on, see below). <br></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This mode allows you to literally paint over objects, shifting their colors towards the target style of the tool. <br>For example, if you paint with yellow fill over a blue-filled object, the object will become greenish blue, then green, then yellowish green, and end up being exactly the yellow color you're painting with. <br>This speed of this gradual transition depends on both Force parameter and pen pressure; also, objects touched by the periphery of the brush are less affected than those hit by the brush centre. <br>Overall, using this tool is very similar to a soft brush in a raster editor such as Gimp or Photoshop. <br></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Color Jitter</strong> mode does not apply any color, but instead jitters (randomises) the colors of the objects it touches. <br>The force of the action determines how strong is the randomisation, i.e. <br>how far the colors deviate from the original values. <br>This mode does not use the tool's style. <br></li>
  </ul>
<p>Both modes work on flat fills and gradients; for gradients, the tool takes into account not only the position of the entire object with gradient, but also the position of each gradient stop relative to the brush. <br>This means that, for example, you can change the blue color only in an object filled with blue-red gradient simply by painting over its blue end with a brush small enough to not touch the red. <br>(Note that color tweaking does not create gradients on objects that used flat color before, but only adjusts existing gradients in the drawing.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">Channels</span></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Color Paint and Color Jitter honor the <strong>Channels</strong> control. <br>This control comprises the four buttons: <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>H</strong></span>, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>S</strong></span>, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>L</strong></span>, and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>O</strong></span>, which allow you to turn on and off the tool's action on the object's hue, saturation, lightness, and opacity, correspondingly. <br>For example, if you want to raise the saturation of some part of your drawing without changing the hue, select some maximum-saturation color (e.g. <br>pure red) and turn off all Channels buttons except <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">S</span></strong>. <br>Similarly, you can replace the hues without affecting saturation or lightness (only <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">H</span></strong> pressed), or lighten/darken all colors without changing their hues and saturation (only <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">L</span></strong> pressed). <br>Pressing <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">O</span></strong> allows you to apply the master opacity from the tool's style to the master opacity of objects (but not fill or stroke opacity).
    <br></p>
  <h5>
<span class="mw-headline">Usage notes</span>
 </h5>
  <p>Color painting with Tweak tool is similar, but not exactly analogous to bitmap painting. <br>Even though the tool itself works as a soft brush, it still applies its color to vector objects, which behave as vector objects usually do. <br>For example, if you want to change the tint of the face in your drawing, and if a hand in the drawing is part of the same object as the face, that hand will change its tint too even if it's located far from the point you are painting. <br>(We foresee a "fracture" command in one of the next versions of Inkscape which will help you turn a monolithic object into a mosaic of small fragments that will be then easy to paint with Tweak tool.) Still, even with this limitation, color painting is a novel way of dealing with vector drawings which allows you to quickly and intuitively make adjustments which would be awkward and slow with traditional approach.
  </p>
  <p>Drawings containing patterns or scatterings of small independent objects are best suited for color painting with Tweak tool. <br>Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> freehand drawings with Calligraphy pen, consisting of many separate strokes; </li>
  </ul>
<ul>
<li> gradient meshes imported from Adobe Illustrator files (Inkscape renders these meshes as lattices of small polygons; while there's no direct support for gradient meshes in Inkscape yet, color painting on such lattices is almost as good); </li>
  </ul>
<ul>
<li> text converted to paths and with Break Apart command applied so that each letter is a separate path; </li>
  </ul>
<ul>
<li> patterns made with the Tile Clones command; note that you need to unset the fill and/or stroke on the original object and use the Color tab to assign some initial color to the clones - this will make them paintable with the Tweak tool without unlinking. <br></li>
  </ul>
<p>Moreover, color tweaking can be useful for compositions with a few objects or even for single objects. <br>Unlike all other color selection methods, painting with the Tweak tool implements the <em>color mixing</em> metaphor which is much more familiar to traditional artists than RGB sliders or even the color wheel. <br>For example, start with a rectangle of pure blue color; then, pick different colors by Color Paint and apply light touches with minimum Force and minimum pen pressure: add a little green, a little brown, a little yellow, etc. <br>until you have the exact hue you need. <br>Similarly, you can whiten or blacken any hue by admixing white or black.
  </p>
  <p>You can also use color tweaking to add a tint, darken/lighten, saturate/desaturate, or color jitter your entire drawing. <br>Just select all in all layers, zoom out, choose a large brush width so it covers all of the drawing, and apply a little color tweaking (with minimum Force) that will therefore affect all visible objects.

<title>Inkscape: ZoomTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Zoom Tool</h2>
<p>The <strong>Zoom Tool</strong> magnifies or "zooms in" on part of the <strong>canvas</strong> and, conversely, "zooms out".
</p>
<p>Because of its utility, zooming can be accomplished from the <strong>Tool Commands Bar</strong>, the keyboard or the mouse (or a combination thereof), and often does not require the Zoom Tool to be activated.
  <br></p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>The Zoom Tool can be activated in the following ways:

  <p>Zooming in sets the zoom factor to a higher lever so that one can see more detail and work more precisely.
  </p>
  <p> You can zoom in by:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>
<strong>Left Clicking</strong> on the canvas with the Zoom Tool active
    <br>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Left Click + Drag</strong> to select the area of the image you want to zoom into

    <br>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>Zooming with the Mouse Wheel performs a precision zoom directly under the cursor. <br>The other incremental zoom methods zoom at the middle of the canvas.
  <br>
</li>
  <li>By default, rotating the mouse wheel scrolls the canvas vertically and Ctrl+wheel zooms in and out. <br>Selecting the <strong>Mouse wheel zooms by default</strong> checkbox in the <em>Scrolling</em> tab of the <em>Inkscape Preferences Dialog</em>, this behavior is reversed: the mouse wheel zooms without Ctrl and scrolls with Ctrl. <br>This new mode should be familiar for users of AutoCAD and CorelDraw. <br></li>
  <li>You can use <strong>Shift+middle button drag</strong>, in any tool, to zoom into a specific area. <br>This works the same as simple drag in Zoom tool, but is faster because it does not require switching away from your current tool. <br>Together with <strong>middle button drag</strong> (panning), <strong>middle button click</strong> (zoom in) and <strong>Shift+middle button click</strong> (zoom out), this completes the set of canvas navigation shortcuts available in any tool or context. <br></li>
  <li>In the Zoom Tool, the Right Mouse Button usually zooms out instead of calling the context menu if it is clicked on empty canvas.

<title>Inkscape: RectangleTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Rectangle Tool</h2>
<p>The <strong>Rectangle Tool</strong> draws boxes (squares and rectangles) which are <strong>live shapes</strong>. <br>Rectangle live shapes can be given rounded corners as well.
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>A new rectangle is drawn by pressing the left mouse button and dragging the mouse.
  <br></p>
<p>Rectangles have two square resize handles in opposite corners (top left and bottom right when the rectangle is at its original orientation). <br>Dragging the resize handles resizes the rectangle's width and height simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Rectangles also have round corner radius handles at the top right to set the radius of the corners. <br>There are two radius dimensions which can be set either together or independently; these separate dimensions affect the horizontal or vertical "sides" of each corner. <br>"Rx" affects the top and bottom side radii, while "Ry" affects the left and right side radii. <br>(The best way to understand this is to play with the controls and settings and watch their effects.)
</p>
<p>A box with rounded corners can be set back to sharp corners with the last button on the Tool Commands Bar, "Make corners sharp".

<title>Inkscape: 3DBoxTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>3D Box Tool</h2>
<p><strong>Inkscape</strong> is a two-dimensional drawing tool. <br>However, very often it is used to create drawings or objects that appear three-dimensional. <br>The <strong>3D box tool</strong> helps you create such drawings by automating the most common operation: creating a box in a given <strong>3D</strong> perspective. <br>The tool automatically ensures that all sides of the box lie on the corresponding perspective lines.
</p>
<p><img title="3DBoxRoom" alt="3DBoxRoom" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/3d-box-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-3DBox-3DBoxRoom-en.png"></p>
<h3> Basic Usage</h3>
<p>In order to represent an object in 3D (it's emulated 3D, so it's rather <strong>2.5D</strong>), the 3D box tool deals with <strong>axes</strong> (XYZ), <strong>planes</strong> (XY, XZ, YZ), <strong>parallel lines</strong> (PL), <strong>converging lines</strong> and <strong>vanishing points</strong> (VP).
</p>
<p>Each dimension can lie on either parallel or converging lines. <br>These lines are drawn in different colors, so that users could distinguish one line from another:
</p>
<ul>
<li>red lines stand for <strong>X direction </strong>(width);</li>
  <li>blue lines stand for <strong>Y direction</strong> (height);</li>
  <li>yellow lines stand for <strong>Z direction</strong> (depth).</li>
</ul>
<p>If lines are converging, they have a vanishing point — a point where they cross. <br>Here is a sample to illustrate how it works:
</p>
<p><img title="3DAxes" alt="3DAxesV3.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/3d-box-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-3DBox-3DAxesV3-en.png"></p>
<p><strong>X</strong> is the vanishing point for X plane
</p>
<p><strong>Z</strong> is the vanishing point for Z plane
</p>
<p><strong>Y</strong> are parallel lines for Y plane
</p>
<p>Here is what happens when you keep moving borders of X and Z planes closer to vanishing points:
</p>
<p><img title="3DNearVP" alt="3DNearVP" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/3d-box-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-3DBox-3DNearVP-en.png"></p>
<p>X and Z planes nearly converged, but Y is more or less the same.
</p>
<p>By default Inkscape makes X and Z lines converging, because it represents usual perspective.
</p>
<div class="tips">
<strong>Note :</strong> Parallel lines do not necessarily have to be 90 degrees to X axis — changing the angle will somewhat skew the object.

<h4>Drawing a 3D box</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">X</span></strong> or<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"> <strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>F4</strong></span> to switch to the 3D Box Tool. <br>Start dragging cursor on canvas. <br>You can use <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong>+drag without releasing the mouse button to extrude in Z direction.

  </p>
  <p>If you need to draw another 3D box with same vanishing point, just keep the previous box selected and start drawing a new one:
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Editing a 3D box</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Adjust any of its 3 dimensions by handles. <br>The 4 handles on the front X/Y side resize it, the four ones on the back X/Y side expand/contract the box in Z direction. <br>With <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong>, the functions of handles on front and back sides are reversed. <br>With <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong>, the side-resizing handles snap to the coordinate axes or diagonals. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Moving a 3D box</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can move a 3D box in perspective by dragging its center marked as an "X" character; without modifiers, movement occurs within the XY-plane (press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> to constrain the movement to the directions of the coordinate axes or diagonals), with <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> the box moves parallel to the Z-axis.
  </p>
  <p><img title="3DBoxCenter" alt="3DBoxCenterV3.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/3d-box-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-3DBox-3DBoxCenterV3-en.png"> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Handling vanishing points</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Adjust the vanishing points of a perspective by dragging them on the canvas (see below) or toggling their states; all boxes sharing this perspective are affected by a vanishing point move.
  </p>
  <p>When several boxes are selected, all vanishing points of their associated perspectives are shown on the canvas. <br>If vanishing points of different perspectives coincide, they are combined in a single "dragger". <br>Moving this dragger moves all the vanishing points simultaneously and transforms the associated boxes accordingly. <br>Note that some non-selected boxes may also be reshaped if their perspectives share the same vanishing point. <br>Pressing <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong> while moving the dragger can be used to only transform the selected boxes, separating their perspectives from the non-selected ones'. <br>On the other hand, when a vanishing point being dragged comes close enough to another one, both snap together and are combined in a single dragger.
  </p>

  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rotating perspective lines</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The various kinds of parentheses, namely <strong>[</strong> <strong>]</strong>, <strong>(</strong> <strong>)</strong>, <strong>{</strong> <strong>}</strong>, can be used to rotate infinite (i.e., parallel) perspective lines in X-, Y-, and Z-direction, respectively. <br>Closing parentheses rotate clockwise and opening parentheses rotate counterclockwise. <br>The angle of rotation is taken from the preferences. <br>Pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> reduces the amount of rotation to 1 screen pixel. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Changing mode of perspective lines</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>When the 3D box tool is active, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">X</span></strong>, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Y</span></strong>, and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Z</strong></span> toggle perspective lines in the corresponding direction between "converging" and "parallel".
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<h4>Inside 3D Box tool</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In SVG, a 3D box is represented as a <strong>group</strong> (svg:g) with a special extension attribute (in Inkscape's namespace); this group contains the 6 quadrilateral <strong>paths</strong> representing the sides of the box. <br>Only the 3D box tool treats this object as a box; for all other tools it is just a group, so you can select any of the paths by Ctrl+click, apply any style to it, delete it, etc. <br>You can of course transform the entire box or any face in it using Selector or Node tools.

<title>Inkscape: EllipseTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Ellipse</h2>
<p>With the <strong>Ellipse tool</strong>, the <strong>Inkscape</strong> artist can draw an ellipse, circle, or arc. <br>As a <strong>Live Shape</strong>, an ellipse can be converted to any elliptical shape (circle or oval); it can also be converted from an ellipse to a pie segment or arc.
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>When an ellipse is drawn there are three edit handles: <em>top</em> (square), <em>left</em> (square) and <em>right</em> (circle).
</p>
<p>The <em>top</em> and <em>left</em> handles control the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively.
  <br></p>
<div>
  <p>Dragging the <em>right</em> handle of a whole ellipse will create an arc or segment; this handle then sets the degree of the arc or segment (measured from the rightmost point of the ellipse at its original orientation).
  </p>
  <p>To easily switch between an arc or pie segment, drag the handle inside or outside of the ellipse. <br>For example, when dragging inside the bounds of the ellipse, the ellipse will be an arc;  when dragging outside of them the arc will be closed and create a pie shape.
  </p>
  <p>These attributes can also be set by the the<strong> Tool Controls Bar</strong>. <br>The <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> degrees may be adjusted precisely with respective the spin boxes; the shape type (segment, arc or whole) can be selected from the corresponding buttons.
    <br></p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>Hold <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> while dragging the arc control to enable snapping at angles as specified in the <span class="green">Inkscape Preferences</span> window. <br></li>
  <li>Hold <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap">Shift</span></span> while drawing to draw the shape with its centre at the cursor's point of origin in order to keep position static during the drawing.</li>

<title>Inkscape: StarTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Star Tool</h2>
<p>Stars<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>polygons are special shapes, difficult to draw by hand while maintaining a regular shape. <br>The <strong>Star Tool</strong> enables stars and regular polygons to be drawn easily in the document. <br>This tool is very convenient even though it may be less often used than the <strong>Rectangle Tool </strong>and <strong>Ellipse Tool</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>Inkscape</strong> stars are <strong>Live Shapes</strong>, and can thus be infinitely modified after creation, with <strong>handles</strong> or tool control<strong> parameters</strong>. <br>By modifying some of the following parameters, this tool can be used to draw triangles and other regular polygons with any number of sides. <br>The included deformation methods allow for some amazing shapes, all while keeping the powerful aspects of easy editability of an <strong>SVG Primitive</strong>.
</p>
<h2>How to Use</h3>
<p>To switch to the Star Tool, you can either

</blockquote>
<h4>Corners</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can define the number of corners and spokes of the shape by adjusting the corners parameter - it can either be specified before drawing a polygon or dynamically modified after selecting an existing polygon. <br>Corner counts are limited from 3 to 1024.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4> Spoke Ratio</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Only accessible in Star Mode, it allows you to define the ratio of spoke length between the star core and its spoke tips. <br>This parameter range is from 0.0 to 1.0.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
<span class="term">Rounded</span></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>This setting allows you to round the corners of the shape in both Polygon Mode and Star Modes of this tool. <br>The range value is from -10.0 to 10.0. <br>Press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span> and drag either handle to modify the rounding of the shape on-canvas.
  </p>
  <div class="tips">Note that dragging each handle gives different results because the degree of rounding is proportional to the angle of displacement from the center of the shape - thus a drag of the middle handle will create a greater degree of rounding than a same-length drag of the outer handle.
    <br>
</div>
  <p>The following image shows some rounding examples, with regular polygons on the first line and stars at the second. <br>There are infinitely more possibilities than shown here. <br>

</blockquote>
<h4>
<strong><span class="term">Randomised</span></strong></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>Randomised</strong> option of Star Tool displaces the inner and outer points of the spokes to random coordinates around the center of the star. <br>The range value runs from -10.0 to 10.0. <br>Near 0.0, the randomness of the displacement ratio low, and it increases as the parameter approaches -10.0 or 10.0.

<title>Inkscape: SpiralTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Spiral</h2>
<p>The <strong><span class="guilabel">Spiral</span> Tool</strong> is one of the special class of tools that create <strong>Live Shapes</strong>. <br>With the Spiral tool, shapes of spiral arcs can be drawn.
</p>
<p> <img title="SpiralEx" alt="SpiralEx" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/spiral-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-spiral-SpiralEx-en.png"></p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>Call the Spiral Tool with its icon on the Toolbox or by pressing <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F9</span></strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">I</span></strong>.
</p>
<p><img title="Spiralhandles" alt="Spiralhandles" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/spiral-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-spiral-Spiralhandles-en.png"></p>
<p>The spiral drawn with the tool has two handles, one on either end of the shape's path. <br>Clicking and dragging the inner-most handle with the spiral tool will change the interior radius of the arc, and the handle on the outter-most end of the path edits the number of turns of the spiral.
</p>
<p> There are <strong>four options</strong> in the Tool Controls bar which can be used to further manipulate the spiral:
</p>

  <p><img src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/spiral-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-spiral-SpiralOptions-en.png"></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Turns</strong> adjusts the number of rotations the spiral takes around its center. <br>Increasing the turns will decrease the width between successive spiral paths, since this option does not increase the dimensions of the spiral.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <br><img title="SpiralTurns" alt="SpiralTurns" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/spiral-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-spiral-SpiralTurns-en.png">
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Divergence</strong> tightens the spiral either toward its center (as if it were being wound tighter) or toward the exterior. <br>When the divergence is increased above 1, it makes the outer part of the spiral looser, or widens the gap between its outermost paths. <br>The reverse is true for values below 1.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> <img title="SpiralDivergence" alt="SpiralDivergence" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/spiral-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-spiral-SpiralDivergence-en.png">
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Inner Radius</strong> does the same as dragging the inner handle. <br>The inner radius parameter is a relation or fraction representing the distance from the exact center of the spiral to the beginning of the inner spiral path relative to the whole spiral radius. <br>When the inner handle has been moved from its position at the center of the spiral, the radius becomes more than 0. <br>When this is true, growing the spiral path by dragging the outer handle will decrease the inner radius, showing its relative nature.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> <img title="SpiralIRadius" alt="SpiralIRadius" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/spiral-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-spiral-SpiralIRadius-en.png">

  <p>With the <strong>Pencil Tool</strong> ( <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">P</span></strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F6</span> </strong>), the <strong>Inkscape</strong> artist creates freehand paths by drawing directly on the canvas in the desired curves. <br>Inkscape evaluates the line or shape drawn by the user and produces <strong>nodes</strong> to form the path. <br>After the path is drawn, the nodes of the path can be edited with the <strong>Node Tool</strong>, like other paths.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="simplesect" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">
  <div class="titlepage">
    <div>
      <div>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<div class="simplesect" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">
  <p>Choose the Pencil Tool, then click and drag the mouse to draw the line. <br>By default it has no <strong>fill</strong>, but this can be set by any means (<span class="green">swatch</span> or <span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog). <br>The line can also be set with <strong>stroke</strong> properties and colors in the <span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog.

<h3> Tips
    <br></h3>
  <p>These tools can create <strong>single dots</strong> by <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong> + click</strong> on the canvas. <br>This creates a small circle filled with the current stroke color. <br>The radius can be set in the <span class="green">Preferences</span> of the respective tools (it is specified as a multiple of the current stroke width). <br><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> + click</strong> creates a dot twice the specified size, and <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span><strong> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> + click</strong> varies the size of the created dots randomly.

<title>Inkscape: CalligraphyTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Calligraphy Tool</h2>
<p><img title="Calligraphy" alt="Calligraphy" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/calligraphy-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-Calligraphy-en.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Calligraphy Tool</strong> uses dynamic drawing techniques that apply simple filters to the cursor place and motion. <br>The SVG "stylus" transforms as if it were a physical stylus or brush, depending on its mass, speed, orientation and friction. <br>(Some of these parameters are affected only by use of an input device such as a drawing tablet.)  By changing these parameters, various types of "strokes" can be made. <br>This makes the Calligraphy tool excellent for drawing more natural, smooth and consistent strokes, particularly when using a pen tablet or similar input device.
</p>
<p>The Calligraphy Tool does not draw a single path line like the freehand tool, but a whole filled shape. <br>This is not a live shape, like rectangles and stars, but an arbitrary shape consisting of node paths. <br>Being comprised of multiple nodes, calligraphy strokes can be modified by other path tools, for example the <em>Node</em> and <em>Tweak</em> tools. <br>Also, like all arbitrary SVG shapes, calligraphy paths have strokes at their edges, so they are affected by the usual <em>Fill</em> and <em>Stroke</em> settings.
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>The Calligraphy Tool can be called by clicking its icon in the Toolbox or by pressing <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">C</span></strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+</strong><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F6</span></strong>.
</p>
<p>Calligraphy shapes are drawn in the same manner as any other shape - just click on the canvas and drag.

<p>The Calligraphy Tool has many options available in the Tool Controls bar which allow the artist to create very specific types of strokes.

<h5>Width</h5>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Trace Lightness to Width</strong> adjusts the width of the stroke to the lightness of objects behind it. <br>In the background objects, white translates into the minimum stoke width (1) and black translates to the maximum (which is set by the Width parameter). <br>This works with both bitmap and vector images and allows the artist to not only hatch over an imported bitmap image or any drawing, but to do so automatically reproducing the highlights and shades of the background with your strokes becoming lighter and heavier as needed. <br>This can work alone or in combination with pressure sensitivity, depending on whether the "Use pressure" button is also toggled.

<h6>Thinning</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Thinning</strong> is a way to modify the width of the calligraphy stroke dynamically according to the speed at which the stroke is made. <br>This value enables the calligraphy tool to emulate true ink flow from a pen or brush. <br>For instance, dragging a stroke at a uniform speed will create a mostly uniform stroke width, while increasing speed will decrease width, and decreasing speed will increase width (to a degree). <br>The higher the thinning value is, the more the stroke will be thinned.
    <br></p>
  <p>Some examples are shown below. <br>Notice that a negative thinning results in a thicking. <br>When set to 0.0, the line keeps its width with uniformity.
    <br></p>

</blockquote>
<h6>Angle</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>Angle</strong> setting is used to emulate a stylus type of writing instrument. <br>Angle will affect the direction at which the stroke creates its thinnest part, just like a calligraphy pen. <br>Values can be set from -90° to 90°. <br>When set to 0, the hair line is horizontal; to 90, vertical.
  </p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>When activated, Angle is modified relatively to tilt of the tablet pen.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h6>Fixation</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fixation</strong> changes the way the Angle width follows the calligraphic path. <br>When set to 0.0, Angle is set always perpendicularly to the path so that the width looks nearly the same all along the path (as if the stylus were rotated constantly in the direction of the stroke). <br>When set to 1.0, Angle is set to adjust to stroke direction most strictly (as if the stylus were kept exactly in the same direction at all times as a machine might be able to do). <br>A setting of a little less than 1.0 (such as 0.9) will most closely follow natural hand movement, like using a real stylus.

</blockquote>
<h6>Caps</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Caps</strong> determines how the line ends. <br>At 0, the end caps will be drawn flat. <br>Increasing the value will create elliptical end caps, and the higher the value the longer the ellipses will be. <br>The max value is 5.00.

</blockquote>
<h6>Tremor</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tremor</strong> affects jitteriness of the stroke. <br>It can be set from 0.0 to 1.0. <br>When set to 0, the line is the most regular.
  </p>

<h6>Wiggle</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wiggle</strong> is a kind of randomization on drawn curves, making a sort of "bumpy" stroke. <br>It generates these curves or "bumps" regularly, and can help to draw some nice typographic shapes, though the result is hardly predictable.
  </p>

<p><img title="calligraphyWiggle" alt="calligraphyWiggle" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/calligraphy-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-calligraphyWiggle-en.png"></p>
<h6>Mass</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mass</strong> affects how quickly the stroke follows the cursor. <br>A heavier mass makes the stroke slower and increases smoothness or regularity of the stroke. <br>Values can be set from 0.0 to 1.0. <br>When set to 0.0 the path just follows the mouse as normal. <br>When set to 1.0, the drawing of the stroke is very slow.

<h4>Engraving
  <br></h4>
<h5>Tracking a Shape
  <br></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most common operations in line engraving is <strong>hatching</strong> (or sometimes <em>cross-hatching</em> when several hatching grids cross): filling a space with many parallel straight or variously curved lines (usually of varying width to represent a gradual shading). <br>You could try to achieve a similar effect with e.g. <br>path interpolation (blending), but it is rather cumbersome and limited; manual drawing of hatch lines, on the other hand, is tedious and nearly impossible to do uniformly. <br>Now Inkscape provides "assisted hatching" by <strong>tracking a guide path</strong>, allowing you to hatch quickly and uniformly and at the same time giving you sufficient manual control over the process.
  </p>
  <p>First, select the <strong>guide path</strong> that you will track. <br>It may be another calligraphic stroke, any path or shape, or even a letter of a text object. <br>Then switch to Calligraphic pen, select the desired parameters (line width, angle, fixation etc.) and, before starting to draw, press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>. <br>You will see a gray <strong>track circle</strong> centered at your mouse pointer and touching the closest point on the selected guide path. <br>(If you have no guide path selected, a statusbar message will tell you to select it.)
  </p>
  <p><img alt="046_engraving_step1.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/calligraphy-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-046_engraving_step1-en.png"></p>
  <p><strong>The </strong>Now move your mouse close to the guide path, so that the track circle radius is equal to the desired spacing of your hatch pattern, and start drawing along the guide path. <br>At that moment, the radius of the circle gets locked; now the circle slides along the guide path - and the actual stroke is drawn by the center of the tracking circle, <em>not</em> by your mouse point. <br>As a result, you are getting a smooth stroke going parallel to the guide path and always at the same distance from it.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="046_engraving_step2.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/calligraphy-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-046_engraving_step2-en.png"></p>
  <p>When the stroke is ready, release your mouse button (or lift your tablet pen) but <strong>do not let go of <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> </strong>because, as long as you have it pressed, the tool remembers the hatch spacing you set when you started drawing. <br>Now, you have just created a new stroke and, as usual with Inkscape tools, it gets selected instead of what was selected before. <br>In our case, this means that the newly drawn stroke itself becomes the new guide path. <br>Next, you can draw a second stroke along the first one, then a third one along the second, etc. <br>Eventually you can fill any desired space with uniform hatching.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="046_engraving_step3.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/calligraphy-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-046_engraving_step3-en.png"></p>
  <p>Alternatively, if you uncheck "Select new path" in the Calligraphy tool preferences, newly created strokes will not be selected, so your original guide path will be kept selected. <br>In this mode, Inkscape will increase the tracking distance after each created stroke so that you can create uniformly spaced hatching by tracking a single guide path.
  </p>
  <p>The attachment to the guide path is not absolute. <br>If you stray your mouse pointer far enough from the guide path, you will be able to tear it off (the track circle turns from green to red) and move freely. <br>This is intentional; this feature allows you, for example, to continue drawing a stroke past the end of a guide stroke, thus making your hatching cover a wider area than the initial guide path. <br>Special care is taken to make such tearing off as smooth as possible and to suppress violent jerks, but this is not always possible; the general advice is to not try to hatch too fast. <br>If jerking and unintended tearoffs still bother you, try increasing the Mass parameter.
  </p>
  <p>Also, special code is in place to prevent flipovers - accidental jumps to the other side of the guide path. <br>Brief flipovers are suppressed, but if you intentionally go over to the other side and stay there, eventually Inkscape will obey and your tracking stroke will also flip over to follow you.
  </p>
  <p>Tracking a guide also allows some slight feedback by gradually changing the tracking distance in response to your drawing behavior. <br>Thus, if you're consistently trying to draw closer or farther from the guide than the current tracking distance, the distance will correspondingly decrease or increase, so you will get a hatching that is slightly spacing in or out. <br>(The effect is very slight, however, so as not to become a nuisance.) Also, note that since tracking follows the edge of the stroke, strokes of varying width (such as those tracing background, see below) will result in gradual bending of the hatching pattern as you proceed
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Engraving</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Combined with the <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> key, the Calligraphy Tool is able to simulate the ancient art of line engraving. <br>Traditional engraving is a very labour-intensive process, and while for a long time it was the only practical way of reproducing lifelike images in black-and-white print, about a century ago it was almost completely displaced by automatic halftone screens in industrial process. <br>However, line engravings have their characteristic charm, and are often still used for certain art applications.

<title>Inkscape: BucketFillTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Bucket Fill Tool</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bucket Fill Tool</strong> is simple - it fills in unfilled areas with color. <br>Being a <strong>vector tool</strong>, however, <strong>Inkscape's</strong> Paint Bucket actually creates a new <strong>path</strong> that "fills in" the area in which you clicked.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the tool's operation <strong>perceptual</strong>, not geometric. <br>That is, when looking for the boundaries around the point you clicked, it takes for such boundaries any <em>visible</em> color changes. <br>This means that filling will stop at <strong>gradients</strong>, blurs, and even the color boundaries in imported <strong>bitmaps</strong>, but will ignore any paths or other objects that are fully (or almost fully) transparent or for any other reason do not stand out from the background. <br>In short, it will work exactly as if you were filling a <strong>rasterized</strong> version of your image in a bitmap editor like <strong>Photoshop</strong> or <strong>GIMP</strong> - but will give you a <strong>vector object</strong> to work with.
</p>
<p>Internally, the tool works by performing a bitmap-based <strong>flood fill</strong> on a <strong>rendered</strong> version of the visible <strong>canvas</strong>, then tracing the resulting fill using <strong>potrace</strong> and placing the traced path into the document.
</p>
<p>It places the rendered path onto the current layer, so you can have a <strong>layer</strong> on top (for example, "Inks") and select the layer below ("Colors") and do the fills so that they always appear below the Inks.
  <br></p>
<p>Because the tool operates in this way, you can, for example, scan a pencil sketch, import the bitmap into Inkscape, and quickly fill all its <strong>cells</strong> with colors without tracing the bitmap first. <br>This is a very convenient and interactive way of digitizing your paper drawings, making the traditional bitmap tracing unnecessary in many cases.
</p>The <strong>resolution</strong> of the bitmap image used to perform the trace is dependent upon your <strong>current zoom level</strong> -- the more 'zoomed in' to an area that you are, the higher the resolution of the bitmap-based flood fill. <br>So, if you have a fill that is too imprecise, has rough corners, or doesn't go where it is supposed to go, just undo it (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">CTRL</span> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">z</span> ), 'zoom in' closer and repeat filling from the same point. <br>Conversely, if the fill leaks out through a small gap, zoom out to make the gap less visible and fill again (or use the <strong>auto gap</strong> closing parameter - see below).
<p><img title="PaintFill" alt="PaintFill" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/bucket-fill-tool/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-PaintFill-en.png"> 
</p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>The <strong>Paint Bucket Tool</strong> works fairly intuitively: click in any area bounded on all sides and it will fill it with color - or, in reality, a path which can be filled and adjusted like any arbitrary path.
</p>
<h4>Style</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Like all object-creating tools, the Paint Bucket may use the <strong>last-set style</strong> for the <strong>objects</strong> it creates (this is the default), or it can use its own <strong>fixed style</strong>. <br>You can switch between these modes on this tool's page in <em><span class="green">Inkscape Preferences</span></em> (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">P</span>). <br>As in all other tools, the <strong>style swatch</strong> on the far right of the <strong>Controls Bar</strong> shows the style that will be used for the next fill object you create. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Controls</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the <strong>Tool Controls </strong>bar: Paint Bucket's perceptual fill can use either all visible colors or specific <strong>color channels</strong>. <br>Using the <strong>Fill by</strong> drop-down list, you can restrict the fill algorithm to one the following channels:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> Red </li>
    <li> Green </li>
    <li> Blue </li>
    <li> Hue </li>
    <li> Saturation </li>
    <li> Lightness </li>
    <li> Alpha </li>
  </ul>
<p> The <strong>Threshold</strong> (in per cent units) controls how large the color difference must be at a point (compared to the initial click point) to stop the fill. <br>'Zero tolerance' means only an area which is strictly the same color will be filled; the larger the tolerance, the easier it will be for the fill to leak into adjacent different-color areas. <br>The default value is 10%.
  </p>
  <p>Using the <strong>Grow/shrink by</strong> parameter, you can control the amount of <strong>inset</strong>/<strong>outset</strong> to be applied to the created fill path. <br>Setting a positive outset causes fill paths to be larger than the filled bitmap area (good for eliminating <strong>anti-aliasing</strong> errors), while setting a negative outset causes the path to be smaller. <br>This works much the same as the Outset and Inset path commands, except it's done automatically after every fill.
  </p>
  <p> With the <strong>Close gaps</strong> parameter, you can make the Paint Bucket tool ignore any gaps in the area boundaries that would normally cause the fill to spill out of the desired area. <br>There are four settings to auto gap:
  </p>
</blockquote>
<ul><ul>
<li> None </li>
    <li> Small (close gaps up to 2 pixels in size) </li>
    <li> Medium (4 pixels) </li>
    <li> Large (6 pixels) </li>
  </ul></ul>
<blockquote>
  <div class="tips">
<strong>Note</strong> : setting this parameter to anything other than <strong>None</strong> may slow down Inkscape noticeably while filling large areas.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h3>Hotkeys</h3>
<p>The tool's <strong>shortcuts</strong> are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Single click</strong> performs filling from the click point. <br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span></strong><strong>+click</strong> performs filling from the click point and then unions the resulting path with the selected path. <br>This way, if your first attempt did not fill in all of the desired area, you can Shift+click the remaining corner to fill it in separately and combine the result with the result of the previous fill. <br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+click</strong> on an object simply changes that object's fill to the current fill color of the tool, and <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+</strong><strong>click</strong> changes the <strong>stroke</strong> to the current stroke color. <br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Click+drag</strong> performs filling from all of the points that you pass while dragging (you will see your path visualized by a red line). <br>From each point, the fill spreads to its neighbours with the colors similar to that point - in other words, it's like clicking with this tool at each point of the drag path and joining the results. <br>This lets you easily fill an area occupied by a gradient or blur - just drag from the darkest to the lightest points in the area you want to fill. <br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+click</strong> and drag works similarly to simple drag, except from each point of the drag path, the fill spreads to the neighbours (if any) with the colors similar to the <em>initial point</em> (the point where you started the drag). <br>This lets you fill a series of similarly-colored yet separated areas (for example, multiple cells in a cartoon) by starting the drag in one of those areas, and <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span></strong>+dragging the tool through all the other areas.</li>
</ul>

<title>Inkscape: ConnectorTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Connector Tool</h2>
<p>The <strong>Connector tool</strong> (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>C</strong><strong>trl</strong></span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>F</strong><strong>2</strong></span> or the <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">o</span></strong> key) draws lines between <strong>objects</strong> that stay connected to other objects as they are manipulated. <br>Any object may be marked as an object<em> to avoid</em>, which causes connectors to automatically route around the object. <br>This is helpful for creating technical illustrations like flowcharts.
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<h4>Connecting</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>A new <strong>connector</strong> can be drawn by clicking and dragging from any point on the canvas. <br>Connectors can also be created with two clicks, rather than click-and-drag, if this is preferred. <br>In this case, click once <strong>on an empty point on the canvas</strong> to begin drawing the connector, then move the mouse to the new connector's target point and then click again to finalize the connector. <br>Single clicking on a canvas object selects/deselects that object, just as with other tools. <br>Usually connectors are drawn <em>from</em> an existing object:
  </p>
  <p><img title="connector_01" alt="connector_01" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/connector-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Connector-connector_01-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Connection point</strong> handles are shown while the mouse cursor is hovering over a non-connector object in the connector tool. <br>Currently they are shown only at the center of objects. <br>When creating a connector, if the connector is started or ended over a connection point then the connector will be <strong>attached</strong> to that object. <br>From then on the connector will be automatically rerouted whenever the attached object is moved.
  </p>
  <p>Connectors attached to objects are currently drawn to the <strong>bounding box</strong> of those objects. <br>It is planned that they will be drawn instead to the edges of objects.
    <br></p>
  <p><img title="connector_02" alt="connector_02" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/connector-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Connector-connector_02-en.png"></p>
  <p>The connector is finalized, when the mouse is released:
  </p>
  <p><img title="connector_03" alt="connector_03" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/connector-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Connector-connector_03-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p>The <strong>Make connectors avoid selected objects</strong> button marks all objects in the selection as "avoided", causing all current and future connectors to automatically avoid these objects.
  </p>
  <p>The <strong>Make connectors ignore selected objects</strong> button marks all objects in the selection as "ignored", causing all current and future connectors to completely ignore these objects. <br>This is the default for all canvas items, i.e., no objects are automatically routed around by default.
  </p>
  <p>Here the middle object is avoided:
    <br></p>
  <p><img title="connector_04" alt="connector_04" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/connector-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Connector-connector_04-en.png"></p>
  <p>By default, the Connector tool will not attach connectors to text objects. <br>A checkbox in the Connector preferences controls this setting.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rerouting</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>A selected connector shows two <strong>endpoint handles</strong>. <br>By clicking and dragging these, the connector can be rerouted and attached/detached from objects.
  </p>
  <p>Connectors moved as part of a selection will stay attached to other objects in the selection, rather than becoming detached from them.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Arranging</h4>
<blockquote>The <strong>margins around avoided shapes</strong> used for autorouting connectors can be adjusted via the "Spacing" control on the controls bar.
  <br><br>The <strong>Remove Overlaps</strong> button to move the selected objects enough that they don't overlap each other. <br>A minimum spacing between the boundaries of objects can be specified. <br>Together with the automatic layout tool, described above, this should be a significant addition to Inkscape's usability for diagramming. <br>Removing overlaps is different from the "Unclump" button in that the former is completely deterministic and guarantees removing overlaps on the first application, but is not concerned with visual perceptive distances between objects. <br>Unclumping, on the other hand, attempts to equalize perceptive distances between objects and can be applied repeatedly for gradual effect.
  <br><br><strong>Automatic Diagram Layout</strong>: this function is available in the <strong>Align and Distribute</strong> dialog and performs automatic layout of diagrams involving a network of shapes and connectors. <br>Edges are treated as if they are springs such that the distance between nodes will be proportional to the path length — number of connectors — between them. <br>Disconnected components (where not every shape is connected) will be arranged around the circumference of a circle.

<h2>Gradients</h2>
<p>The <strong><span class="guilabel">Gradient</span> Tool</strong> allows the progressive passage of one color to another (or multiple others) in an object. <br>It can be used on any <strong>shape</strong>, closed or opened, as a <strong>fill</strong> or a <strong>stroke</strong> (applied separately). <br>Any number of selected objects can simultaneously display <strong>handles</strong> and <strong>direction lines</strong> for the <strong>linear</strong> and <strong>radial</strong> <strong>gradients</strong> in their fills or strokes. <br>You can drag these handles directly in the drawing, to interactively adjust gradient positions.
</p>
<p>The gradient can be set in the <span class="green">Fill</span> and in the <span class="green">Stroke Paint</span> dialog to replace of any other type of coloration.
</p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>To invoke, either click the Gradient Tool icon <img title="gradienttool" alt="gradienttool" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/gradient-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-gradienttool-en.png" align="absmiddle"> or press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong> +<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F1</span></strong>.
</p>
<h4>Types of gradients</h4>
<p><img title="GradientsInfos" alt="GradientsInfos" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/gradient-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-gradients-GradientsInfos-en.png"></p>
<p>There are two types of gradients:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  <p><strong>Linear gradients</strong> transition the color change from one point to another in a straight line. <br>Just click where the gradient should begin, hold and drag, and release where it should end. <br>  Two handles now appear: the handle of the beginning is square and the end is a circle. <br>The two handles can now be used to change the color (select each one and choose the color for it from the fill and stroke dialog) or move and change the gradient direction.
  </p>
  <p><img title="GradientLinear" alt="GradientLinear" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/gradient-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-gradients-GradientLinear-en.png"></p> </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Radial gradients</strong> work as colored circles with the color transition beginning at the center. <br>Three handles are available : the square one is the center of the gradient, and the circle ones change the radius of the gradient. <br>When the radius is the same for both circle handle, the gradient is perfectly circular. <br>To move the placement of a radial gradient in the object, drag the square handle.
  </p>
  <p><img title="GradientRadial" alt="GradientRadial" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/gradient-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-gradients-GradientRadial-en.png"></p> </li>
</ol>
<p>Once a gradient is created it is automatically saved in the drop-down list of the Gradient Tool Options bar so that it can be easily reused on other shapes.
</p>
<h4>More colors</h4>
<p>To have more than two colors on a gradient, just double-click on the gradient base path to make a new handle (stop) appear.
</p>
<p>By default first and last color stops have fill color that matches original flat color fill of the object, but opacity drops from 100% to 0% accordingly. <br>All new color stops in between will inherit original fill color, but have various opacity depending on position of each color stops on the gradient line (i.e. <br>percentage of the radius).
  <br></p>
<p><strong>Click</strong> in the <strong>swatch</strong> to set the color. <br>You can move this handle to adjust the position of this stop. <br>To delete a stop, just press the<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"> Backspace</span></strong> key.
</p>
<p><img title="GradientNewStop" alt="GradientNewStop" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/gradient-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Calligraphy-gradients-GradientNewStop-en.png"></p>
<h4>Selecting multiple stops</h4>
<p><strong>More than one gradient stop</strong> can be selected at a time. <br>Shortcuts for working with multiple stop selections are generally modeled on the Node tool.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Add a stop to the selected stops by <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+click</strong>. <br></li>
  <li> Press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">A</span></strong> to select all stops in the selected objects. <br></li>
  <li> <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+drag</strong> around stops to add them to selection. <br></li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple selected stops:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be moved together by <strong>mouse drag</strong> or by <strong>arrow keys</strong>. <br>For example, creating a linear gradient, then press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong></strong>+<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">A</span></strong> to select all stops and use arrow keys to move the entire gradient as a whole. <br></li>
  <li>Can be deleted at the same time by pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Del</strong></span>. <br></li>
</ul>
<p>An always up-to-date description of the current handle selection is provided in the statusbar in the Gradient tool, including the number of selected handles (and the type of the single selected handle), as well as the total number of handles and selected objects.
</p>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">Editing intermediate stops</span></h4>
<p><strong>Intermediate stops</strong> in gradients can be added, deleted, and edited right on canvas.
</p>
<p>Stops can be added by <strong>double clicking</strong> or by <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+Click</strong> on the gradient line. <br>Also, you can <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> a color from the palette onto the gradient line to create a new stop with this color. <br>Dropping a color on an existing stop changes the color of that stop.
</p>
<p>When two or more adjacent stops are selected, pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ins</strong></span> adds stops in the middles of all selected stop intervals.
</p>
<p>Intermediate stops can be <strong>mouse-dragged</strong> or moved by <strong>arrow keys</strong> along their gradient line, within the limits of the adjacent unselected stops (or end handles).
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragging with <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span> moves the selected stops snapping them to 1/10 fractions of the available range. <br></li>
  <li>Dragging with <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> moves the selected stops depending on how close each one is to the stop being dragged, using a smooth bell-like curve similar to the node sculpting feature in Node tool. <br>This makes it easy to approximate different gradient profiles; for example, if you have a two-stop gradient that you want to shape according to a curve profile, select both ends of the gradient, press <strong>Ins</strong> a few times to add a number of intermediate nodes, then <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span><strong>+drag</strong> a node in the middle to smoothly profile the gradient. <br></li>
</ul>
<p>Stops can also be moved by <strong>arrow keys</strong> with all the regular modifiers (<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span> for 10× movement, <strong>Alt</strong> for pixel-size movement at the current zoom, <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Shift</strong></span><strong>+</strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Alt</strong></span> for 10 pixels movement at the current zoom).
</p>
<p>Stops can be deleted by <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+Click</strong> on a stop or by the <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Del</strong></span> key for all the selected stop(s).
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you delete an end stop, the nearest intermediate stop becomes the new end stop of the gradient (without moving — i.e., the gradient span becomes shorter). <br></li>
  <li>When you delete an end stop and there are no intermediate stops, the object will be painted with a solid fill taken from the color &amp; opacity of the remaining stop. <br></li>
</ul>
<p>Pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span><strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">L</span></strong> with some intermediate stops selected attempts to <em>simplify</em> the selected portion of the gradient, removing those stops that can be removed without too much change in the way the gradient looks. <br>In particular, new stops created by double-clicking or pressing Ins initially do not change the appearance of the gradient, so if you press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>L</strong></span><strong></strong>, all redundant stops that weren't moved or repainted since creation will be deleted.
</p>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">Automatic duplication of gradients</span></h4>
<p>When copy/pasting or duplicating an object with gradient, it automatically gets a <strong>copy</strong> of the original gradient, so modifying it does not affect the source object's gradient anymore .
</p>
<p>However, to accommodate the needs of users who rely on sharing the same gradient definition across objects, this behavior can be optionally suppressed. <br>The <strong>Prevent sharing of gradient definitions</strong> checkbox on the Misc tab of Inkscape Preferences is by default checked; if you uncheck it, Inkscape does not automatically copy gradient definitions for new objects, which means that copy/pasting, duplicating, pasting style, and explicit assignment of a gradient to an object via the Gradient tool controls results in a shared gradient definition, so that changing the colors or mid-stop positions of the gradient on one object (but not changing the coordinates of the end handles) affects all other objects that share the same definition.

<title>Inkscape: DropperTool</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2> Dropper Tool</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dropper Tool </strong>is used to select an <strong>object</strong>'s <strong>fill</strong> or <strong>stroke</strong> color by <strong>sampling</strong> the color of an area of the <strong>canvas</strong>. <br>The color selected is the single point at the center of the cross at the end of the Dropper Tool icon.
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Select an object to which you want to apply a new color and press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F7</span></strong> or <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">D</span></strong> to switch to Dropper. <br><strong>Click</strong> a point on the canvas which is the desired color - the fill of the selected object will be changed to the target color. <br><strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift + Click</span></strong> to apply this color to the stroke.
</p>
<p>The shortcut <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">D</span></strong> can be used to <em>toggle</em> (not just switch to) the Dropper tool — much like space is used to toggle the Selector Tool. <br>That is, pressing <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">D</span></strong> a second time switches back to the tool used before.
  <br></p>
<h4>Alpha Settings
  <br></h4>
<p>The toolbar has only two options:
  <br></p>
<p><img title="dropper_toolbar" alt="dropper_toolbar" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_toolbar-en.png"><br></p>
<p>The left icon toggles <em>picking</em> the <strong>alpha</strong> <strong>channel</strong>. <br>The right icon toggles <em>setting</em> the alpha channel.
  <br></p>
<p>Suppose you have an object selected and, using Dropper, click on an object which has blue transparent fill (#389bff7f).
</p>
<p><img title="dropper_01" alt="dropper_01" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_01-en.png"></p>
<p>If the "Pick alpha" checkbox is off, the selected object will get the fill color #9ccdffff (i.e. <br>faded-out blue) and opaque:
</p>
<p><img title="dropper_02_en" alt="dropper_02_en" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_02_en-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>If the "Pick alpha" checkbox is on, but "Set alpha" is off, the selected object will get the fill color #389bffff (bright blue) and opaque:
  <br></p>
<p><img title="dropper_03_en" alt="dropper_03_en" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_03_en-en.png"><br>If both "Pick alpha" and "Set alpha" are on, the selected object will get the fill color #389bff7f (pale blue) and half-transparent, i.e. <br>fully match the fill style of the object from which the color was inherited:
</p>
<p><img title="dropper_04_en" alt="dropper_04_en" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_04_en-en.png"><br></p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
  <ul type="disc"></ul>
<p>Note that in no situation can Dropper change the <em>master opacity</em> of the selected object(s) (only the fill/stroke opacity), although it can pick it just as it does any other kind of opacity. <br>
    <br></p>
  <h4>Select Average Color
    <br></h4>
  <p>There are cases also, when you might want to apply an average color of an area - for example, an object with <strong>gradient</strong> fill.
  </p>
  <p>With an object selected, click and drag the <strong>Dropper Tool</strong> from the central point of an area with the average color you want to pick:
  </p>
  <p><img title="dropper_05" alt="dropper_05" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_05-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p>The selected object will be filled with the averaged color value of the dropper selection.
    <br></p>
  <p> <img title="dropper_06" alt="dropper_06" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_06-en.png"></p>
  <p>The same can be done for stroke by <strong>Shift + Click + Drag</strong>:
  </p>
  <p><img title="dropper_07" alt="dropper_07" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_07-en.png"><br></p>
  <p>And you get:
  </p>
  <p><img title="dropper_08" alt="dropper_08" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/dropper-tool/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-Dropper-dropper_08-en.png"><br></p>
  <ul type="disc"></ul>
</div>
<h3>Hotkeys</h3>
<p><span class="keycap"></span><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Click</strong></span> picks the inverse of the color selected by the <strong>Dropper Tool</strong> (also works with averaged color selections and <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts"></span></strong>applying to target object borders).
  <br></p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>You can pick a color from the target object itself. <br>You can do this, for example, to set the stroke fill the same as the object fill.
  <br></p>

   

<title>Inkscape: ModifyPathEffects</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Path modification Effects</h2>
<p><strong>Modify Path</strong> <strong>Effects</strong> work on a selection of any number of <strong>paths</strong> and modify them in various ways without creating new paths or deleting existing ones.
</p>
<h3>Available effects</h3>
<h4>Envelope and Perspective</h4>

  <p>Maps <strong>bounding box</strong> of a path to <strong>quadrilateral</strong> to achieve effect of a perspective. <br>These two effects are quite similar, but differ in level of natural look of the desired effect.
    <br></p>
  <p>Here is how to use it:
  </p>
  <ol>
<li>Draw your to-be-distorted path</li>
    <li>Draw and position a four <strong>node</strong> path (<strong>envelope</strong> <strong>frame</strong>).</li>
    <li>Place the to-be-distorted path inside/above the envelope frame.</li>
    <li>Select the path you wish to distort first and then add to selection the envelope frame. <br>The original position of the four nodes is considered to be clockwise around the bounding box of the path to distort beginning in the upper left corner.</li>
    <li>Apply the effect.</li>
  </ol>
Here is the difference:
<br>
<br>
<br>



<img src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/modify-path/static/Inkscape-Advanced-ModifyPathEffects-envelope_perspective-en.png">
<h4>Add Nodes</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Adds nodes to the selected paths. <br>Each segment of the selected path is subdivided into ceil (Length/Max) equal length segments. <br>Lengths are measured in <strong>SVG</strong> <strong>User Units </strong>calculated from the path data and do not take into account any transforms.
  </p>
  <p>Parameters for example below:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> Division method: by number of segments</li>
    <li>Maximum segment length (px): 5</li>
    <li>Number of segments: 2</li>
  </ul>
<p><img title="AddNodes" alt="AddNodes" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/modify-path/static/Inkscape-Advanced-ModifyPathEffects-AddNodes-en.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Color Markers to Match Stroke</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Currently available SVG 1.1 Full specification doesn't allow using the same color for the path and its markers. <br>This extension is a temporary workaround to fix that (until the new improved SVG specification is out). <br>Just change the stroke color of your path and call this effect to recolor its markers to match.
  </p>
  <p><img title="ColorMarkers" alt="ColorMarkers" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/modify-path/static/Inkscape-Advanced-ModifyPathEffects-ColorMarkers-en.png"><br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Flatten Beziers</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Flattens paths in the current selection, approximating each path with a <strong>polyline</strong> whose segments meet the specified criteria for flatness. <br>Lower flatness values make a smoother line.
    <br></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Parameters for example below:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> Flatness:10 </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  </p>
  <p> <img src="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/images/FlattenBeziersExample.png"></p>
</blockquote> <a name="Fractalize"></a>
<h4>Fractalize</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Replaces each segment of the selected path by a crooked line, subdivided to the given depth, with randomly displaced nodes.
  </p>
  <p>Available options are:
  </p>
  <p>Parameters for example below:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> Subdivisions: 6 </li>
    <li> Smoothness: 4.0 </li>
  </ul>
<a name="Jitter_nodes"></a>
  <p><img src="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/images/FractalizeExample.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Jitter nodes</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Randomly shifts nodes (and, optionally, <strong>node handles</strong>)
    <br></p>
  <p>Parameters for example below:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> Maximum Displacement in X: 50.0 </li>
    <li> Maximum Displacement in Y: 50.0 </li>
    <li> Shift nodes: checked </li>
    <li> Shift node handles: checked </li>
    <li> Use normal distribution: checked </li>
  </ul>
<p><img title="JitterNodes" alt="JitterNodes" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/modify-path/static/Inkscape-Advanced-ModifyPathEffects-JitterNodes-en.png"><br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Straighten Segments</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Straightens curved segment to a user defined level (in percents), using of two behaviours (<strong>1</strong> stands for  rounded corners, <strong>2</strong> stands for less rounded corners).
  </p>
  <p>Parameters for example below:
  </p>
  <ul>
<li> Percent:50 </li>
    <li> Behavior: 1 </li>
  </ul>
<p><img src="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/images/StraightenSegmentsExample.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Whirl</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Twists the selected paths around the specified center point.
  </p>

<title>Inkscape: TextAndPaths</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Text and Paths</h2>
<p>Text and path can be complementary elements that work together. <br>Some options of the <span class="blue">Text</span> menu are very interesting.
</p>
<h3>Put on Path / Remove from Path</h3>
<p>Inkscape has support for the SVG element &lt;textPath&gt;. <br>That allows putting a text on a path so that it follows its shape. <br>Both text and path remain fully editable (including kerns and letterspacing in text).
</p>
<p>Select the path and the text and use <span class="blue"><span class="guimenu">Text</span></span><span class="guimenu">-&gt;<span class="blue">Put on Path</span></span>. <br>When you move the path, its attached text moves with it; however, you can move the text away from its path or transform it without losing the link. <br>The <span class="blue"><span class="guimenu">Text</span></span><span class="guimenu">-&gt;<span class="blue">Remove from Path</span></span> command converts a text-on-path into a regular text object.

<h3>Flow into Frame / Unflow from Frame</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>The <span class="blue">Flow into frame</span> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">W</span></strong> command of the <span class="blue">Text</span> menu takes any selected text and puts it into the selected shape. <br>Word-wrapping is automatically done so that the text fits the shape as precisely as possible. <br>Manual adjustment can still be done on the text after this. <br>To separate the text from the path, just use <span class="blue">Unflow</span> or press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+ <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">W</span></strong>.

<title>Inkscape: CopyCloneDuplicate</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Copy, Clone and Duplicate</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The artist may have need, at some point in his work, to replicate an object he has created for any number of purposes. <br>Possibly he is populating a scene with bubbles or blades of grass which will all look exactly alike, or else he may want to create a very similar object which has some minor modifications.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, Inkscape offers several tools to replicate objects. <br>Each one has advantages in disadvantages, of course, which will be defined also by the purpose of the replicant object.
</p>
<p>A strict <em>copy</em> of an object repeats the object on screen and within the xml code, and the new object is entirely separate from the original. <br>This means that changes can be made to the replicant indifferently to the original, and changes made to the original do not affect the replicant either. <br>This is done with either the <strong>Copy</strong> or <strong>Duplicate</strong> commands.
  <br></p>
<p>A <em>clone</em> is merely a repetition of the original on screen and in the code. <br>Most modifications made to the original, like fill and transparency, are transferred to the replicant as well, and only a few modifications, such as transform and position, may be made to the replicant directly (some of these only under certain circumstances). <br>Clones are created with the <strong>Clone</strong> command.
  <br></p>
<h3>How to Use
  <br></h3>
<h4>Copy</h4>
<p>The <strong>Copy</strong> command ( <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">C</span> or <em><span class="blue">Edit</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Copy</span></em> or the command bar button) makes an exact copy of the selection in Inkscape's memory; the <strong>Paste</strong> command ( <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">V</span> or <em><span class="blue">Edit</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Paste</span></em> or the command bar button) puts an exact copy under the cursor. <br>The last selection to be copied can be pasted an indefinite number of times. <br>It is also possible to paste the object wherever it is needed, for instance on an other layer, without the trouble of having to reposition the copy after its creation.
</p>
<h4>Duplicate</h4>
<p>The <strong>Duplicate</strong> command ( <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">D</span> or <em><span class="blue">Edit</span></em> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Duplicate</span></em> ) allows you to copy and paste a selection automatically with one command. <br>The new object or selection is in exactly the same position as the original and is selected (instead of the original), ready for further manipulation.
</p>
<h4>Clone</h4>
<p>The <strong>Clone</strong> command ( <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap">Alt</span></span> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">D</span> or <span class="blue"><em><span class="guimenuitem">Edit</span></em></span> <span class="guimenuitem">&gt;</span> <span class="blue"><em><span class="guimenuitem">Clone</span></em></span> ) allows you to create a copy of the selection that is linked to the original, also known as its <em>parent</em>. <br>The clone's shape, style (fill and stroke, transparency) and dimensions are linked to its parent. <br>Thus, editing the parent's transparency (etc.) will also affect the clone's transparency.
  <br></p>
<div class="tips">
  <p>You can clone multiple object by grouping them first.
  </p>
  <p>A clone can be a parent to another clone. <br>Any modifications to the original will affect all clones down the hierarchy of clones.
  </p>
  <p>The <em>fill</em> and <em>stroke paint</em> of a clone is the same as its parent's <em>unless the <strong>parent</strong></em> has "Unset paint" activated for either in the <em><span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span></em> dialog. <br>Unsetting <em>fill</em> will make the parent's fill black as well as the clone's, but the clone's fill can then be reset while the parent's cannot; unsetting <em>stroke paint</em> will make the stroke disappear so that the clone's <em>stroke</em> and <em>stroke paint</em> can be adjusted while the parent's cannot (it will remain invisible unless paint is reset for the parent).
  </p>
</div>
<h4>Unlink clone</h4>
<div class="mediaobject"> <strong>Unlink clone</strong> ( <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap">Alt</span></span> <span class="keycap">+</span> <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap">Shift</span></span> <span class="keycap">+</span> <span class="keycap"><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">D</span></span> or <span class="guimenuitem"><span class="accel"><em><span class="blue">Edit</span></em> &gt; <span class="blue"><em>Clone</em></span> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Unlink clone</span></em></span></span> ) separates a clone definitively from its parent, effectively making it only a copy. <br>After that you can apply changes to the parent without changing the copy.
  <br>
</div>
<h4>Select original</h4>
<p>Use <strong>Select original</strong> ( <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap">Shift</span></span> + <span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><span class="keycap">D</span></span> or <em><span class="blue"><span class="guimenuitem"><span class="accel">E</span>dit</span></span></em> <span class="guimenuitem">&gt; <span class="blue"><em>Clone</em></span> &gt; <em><span class="blue">Select <span class="accel">o</span>riginal</span></em></span> ) to find the parent of a selected clone. <br>This is very useful when you have lost your parent.

<title>Inkscape: ClipAndMask</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Clipping paths and masks</h2>
<h3>Introduction
  <br></h3>
<p>Clip paths, masks, and patterns are greatly useful additions to an artist or designers' tool set. <br>A common property that all three share is the concept of boundaries. <br>Clip paths and masks bound the contents of the items they contain, whereas patterns are only visible inside the bounds of the object they are applied to (in all three cases cropping visibility).
</p>
<p>These methods do not delete parts of your objects, they merely tell the SVG renderer not to display them. <br>This non-destructive editing makes it so that we can also release objects from from their bounded areas as well.
</p>
<p>There are benefits to working with clip paths or masks combined with either individual or grouped objects.
</p>
<p>Use of patterns fills is addressed in a dedicated chapter.
</p>
<h3>Clipping</h3>
<p>The clip function in Inkscape allows an object or a group of objects to be clipped (cropped) so that only parts of the elements are visible. <br>Clipping can be applied to any object (including groups, layers, bitmaps, etc.)
</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand clipping is to see it in action. <br>Take the following assortment of objects:
</p>
<p><img title="clipmask_01" alt="clipmask_01" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/clip-and-mask/static/Inkscape-Clipmask-clipmask_01-en.png"></p>
<p>Now, place another object on top of all the others. <br>This is what we are using for our clipping object. <br>Note that the Z-order of the clipping object is important, as the default behavior in Inkscape takes the top-most object as the clipping object. <br>Also note that the style (fill, stroke, opacity etc.) of the object is irrelevant, all that is used when clipping is the shape of the object.
</p>
<p><span class="external free"><img title="clipmask_02" alt="clipmask_02" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/clip-and-mask/static/Inkscape-Clipmask-clipmask_02-en.png"></span>
</p>
<p>The next step is to select all the objects that you want clipped and the clipping object. <br>Then in the menus, go to <span class="blue">Object</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Clip</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Set</span>. <br>The result is:
</p>
<p><span class="external free"><img title="clipmask_03" alt="clipmask_03" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/clip-and-mask/static/Inkscape-Clipmask-clipmask_03-en.png"></span>
</p>
<p>Since this is all non-destructive editing, it means that we can also release objects from a clip. <br>Do this by selecting the object that you wish to release, and in the menus go to <span class="blue">Object</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Clip</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Release</span>. <br>In the following example the blue star object was selected, and the clip was released:
</p>
<p><img title="clipmask_04" alt="clipmask_04" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/clip-and-mask/static/Inkscape-Clipmask-clipmask_04-en.png"></p>
<p>So the purple clipping object has now returned, and the blue star object is no longer clipped. <br>Note that the other two objects are still clipped, as the clip was applied to 3 seperate objects. <br>These clips still apply and can be released if needed. <br>Because clipping paths can be applied to any object, if you wanted to treat the 3 objects as a whole, you would group them, then apply the clip to the group.
</p>
<p> Clipping can be done on any object, even objects that have had filters applied to them. <br>Below is an example of using clipping to create a bubble effect on a circle:
</p>
<p><img title="clipmask_05" alt="clipmask_05" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/clip-and-mask/static/Inkscape-Clipmask-clipmask_05-en.png"></p>
<p>A clip can also be done on bitmaps that are embedded into or linked from an SVG:
</p>
<p><img title="clipmask_06" alt="clipmask_06" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/clip-and-mask/static/Inkscape-Clipmask-clipmask_06-en.png"></p>
<h3>Masking</h3>
<span class="mw-headline"></span>
<p>Like clip paths, masks allows an object or a group of objects to be visually cropped. <br>The difference is that the mask's black or transparent areas become fully transparent in the masked object; mask's opaque white areas become fully opaque; and all intermediate colors translate into intermediate levels of opacity in the masked object. <br>This allows you to apply, for example, arbitrary transparency gradients to objects.
</p>
<p>In the following example you will see both the masks and the items they're applied to. <br>As you'll notice, masks offer the ability for you to texture objects, give them depth, and other things that clip paths can't provide:
</p>

<title>Inkscape: AlignandDistribute</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Align and Distribute</h2>
<p><strong>Align and Distribute</strong> moves multiple selected objects to the same axis and distributes them equally relative to a selected anchor object. <br>The <span class="green">Align and Distribute</span> dialog offers many ways of applying these functions to object selections.
  <br></p>
<h3>
<img title="alignanddistribute" alt="alignanddistribute" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/align-and-distribute/static/Inkscape-AlignAndDistribute-alignanddistribute-en.png"><br></h3>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>The Align and Distribute dialog can be called by pressing <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">A</span></strong>, selecting <span class="blue"><em>Object</em></span> &gt; <span class="blue"><em>Align and Distribute</em></span>, or clicking the icon on the Toolbar:
</p>
<p> <img title="ADicon" alt="ADicon" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/align-and-distribute/static/Inkscape-AlignAndDistribute-ADicon-en.png"></p>Make sure your objects are selected. <br>Depending on which object you wish to have as the <strong>anchor</strong> and which <em>relative to</em> setting you have selected, order of selection will be important.
<br><h4>"Relative to"</h4>
<p>Objects can be aligned and distributed relative to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the last or first selected
  <br>
</li>
  <li>the biggest or smallest item
  <br>
</li>
  <li>the page
  <br>
</li>
  <li>the drawing (all objects within the document)
  <br>
</li>
  <li>the selection of objects
  <br>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Align
  <br></h4>
<p>To align selected objects, click one of the <em>align</em> icons:
  <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Align right sides of objects to left side of anchor</li>
  <li>Align left sides</li>
  <li>Center on vertical axis</li>
  <li>Align right sides</li>
  <li>Align left sides of objects to right side of anchor</li>
  <li>Align baseline anchors of text vertically</li>
  <li>Align bottoms ob objects to top of anchor</li>
  <li>Align tops</li>
  <li>Center on horizontal axis</li>
  <li>Align bottoms</li>
  <li>Align tops of objects to bottom of anchor</li>
  <li>Align baseline anchors of texts horizontally</li>
</ul>
<h4>Distribute</h4>
<p>To distribute selected objects, click one of the <em>distribute</em> icons:
  <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Distribute left sides equidistanly</li>
  <li>Distribute centers equidistanly horizontally</li>
  <li>Distribute right sides equidistanly</li>
  <li>Make horizontal gaps between objects equal</li>
  <li>Distribute baseline anchors of text horizontally</li>
  <li>Distribute tops euidistanly</li>
  <li>Distribute centers equidistanly vertically</li>
  <li>Distribute bottoms equidistanly</li>
  <li>Make vertical gaps between objects equal</li>
  <li>Distribute baseline anchors of text vertically</li>
  <li>Randomize centers in both dimensions</li>
  <li>Unclump objects ; try to equalize edge-to-edge distances</li>
</ul>
<h4>Remove overlaps</h4>
<p>You can also define:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum horizontal gaps between objects,
  <br>
</li>
  <li>Mimimum vertical gaps,</li>
  <li>Move objects as little as possible so that their bounding boxes do not overlap</li>
</ul>
<h4>Connector network layout</h4>
<p>If you are using the connector tool and need to distribute the connected objects, use this button to rearrange the selected connectors.
</p>
<h4>Nodes</h4>
<p>There are 4 buttons to organize nodes in path. <br>Select the nodes with Node Tool and click one of the <em>node align</em> buttons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Align selected nodes horizontally</li>
  <li>Align selected nodes vertically</li>
  <li>Distribute selected nodes horizontally</li>
  <li>Distribute selected nodes vertically
  <br>
</li>
</ul>
<title>Inkscape: Layers</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Layers</h2>
<p class="definition"><strong>Layers</strong> are a type of object group within an <strong>SVG</strong> document. <br>As the name indicates, they are like stacked slices of the image which can be stacked, arranged, added and removed. <br>In addition, layers can be locked and made invisible to ease editing of objects within other layers of the document.
  <br></p>
<p> Layers can be very useful for several purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Arranging</strong> sets of <strong>objects</strong> by <strong>z-order</strong> (or <strong>stacking</strong>);
  <br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Grouping</strong> objects which should be made visible/invisible or locked/unlocked together;</li>
  <li>Setting background layers which are visible but not selectable;</li>
  <li>etc (limited only by your imagination)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Layers Widget on the Status Bar</h3>
<p>The quickest and easiest way to work with layers is to use the layers <strong>widget</strong> on the <strong>statusbar</strong>.
</p>
<p><img title="layers_status_bar" alt="layers_status_bar" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/layers/static/Inkscape-Layers-layers_status_bar-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>Once you have created multiple layers in your drawing, you can select a layer easily from the combo box. <br>You can also <strong>hide</strong> / <strong>unhide</strong> or <strong>lock</strong> / <strong>unlock</strong> the current layer from this widget.
  <br></p>
<h3>The Layers Dialog</h3>
<p>The <em><span class="green">Layers</span></em> dialog controls all layer functions - adding new layers, <strong>renaming</strong>, <strong>deleting</strong>, <strong>arranging</strong>, <strong>toggling</strong> visibility and <strong>edit-locking,</strong> and setting <strong>Blend</strong> mode and <strong>opacity</strong>.
</p>
<p><img title="layers_dialog" alt="layers_dialog" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/layers/static/Inkscape-Layers-layers_dialog-en.png"> 
</p>
<h3>Blend Mode and Opacity</h3>
<p>You can choose to apply a Blend mode to layers, which makes all objects in a layer blend together as if they were one object - i.e., the two objects within the same layer will not blend with each other when layer blend modes are used. <br>The available modes are the common <strong>Multiply</strong>, <strong>Screen</strong>, <strong>Darken</strong>, and <strong>Lighten</strong>.
</p>
<p>Opacity for an entire layer operates in a similar manner - objects within the layer have their opacity set as if they were a single object, so that one will not show through the others. <br>Only objects from layers beneath will show through the affected layers.
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<div> To open the <em><span class="green">Layers</span></em> dialog, press <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span></strong>+<strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shft</span></strong>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts"><strong>L</strong></span> or select <em><span class="green">Layer</span>&gt;</em><span class="blue"><em>Layers</em></span>.

<title>Inkscape: Grouping</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h1>Grouping</h2>
<p>Sometimes several <strong>objects</strong> need to be manipulated together in a <strong>group</strong> rather than separately. <br>For example, if you want to keep the position of several objects relative to each other but still be able to grab and move those objects around the <strong>canvas</strong> quickly and easily. <br>You might also want to adjust one setting for several objects at the same time, such as <strong>fill</strong> or <strong>transparency</strong>.
</p>
<p>A group is treated as a <em>single</em> object, and for most operations it can be manipulated as such. <br>For example, groups can be "stacked", meaning that you can create groups made of groups or groups other objects. <br>(This can be helpful, but it can also be very confusing if it becomes complicated.)
</p>
<p>Groups cannot, however, be created between groups; in other words, you cannot select one object from two groups and create a new group without destroying or modifying the original groups.

<title>Inkscape: FillAndStroke</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Fill and Stroke</h2>
<p>The <span class="green"><span class="guilabel">Fill</span></span><span class="guilabel"> and <span class="green">Stroke Paint</span> </span>panels are found in the <span class="green">Style</span> dialog. <br>The settings contained in these panels are used to apply color or pattern styles to their respective object elements, and function almost the same for each. <br>Fill affects the interior part of an object (anything inside the object's <strong>path</strong>), Stroke Paint affects the path's stroke following its border.
</p>
<p><strong>An interesting point:</strong> when stroke paint has partial transparency, the object's fill will show through the inner half of the stroke paint but not the outer half, since the path stops at the center of the stroke and bounds the object's fill. <br>This can either make for interesting drawing possibilities or frustrated artists. <br>This is by SVG specification design.
</p>
<p><img title="Fill" alt="Fill" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-Toolbox-objects-Fill-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>The fill or stroke paint of an object can be set to:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
  <ul type="disc">
<li>
    <p><strong>No Paint </strong>
    </p> </li>
    <li>
<strong>Plain Color </strong>
    <br>

    <li>
    <p><strong>Linear Gradient </strong>

    <li>
    <p><strong>Pattern </strong>
    </p> </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Unset</strong> (used mostly for creating <strong>clones</strong> that are styled independently from their master)
      <br></p> </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>In addition, there are a few settings that can really complicate the ease with which this dialogue might otherwise be understood:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even-odd</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Non-zero</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Blur</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>Opacity</strong>
  <br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Use
  <br></h3>
<p>Select one or more objects or groups you want to edit, then call the <span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog by selecting <span class="blue">Object</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Fill and Stroke</span> or by pressing<span class="guilabel"></span> <strong><span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F</span></strong>.
</p>The following list describes each property setting. <br>(Examples are given using the <strong>Fill</strong> properties since they are seen more easily.)
<h4>No Paint
  <br></h4>
<blockquote> <img title="no_paint" alt="no_paint" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-no_paint-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>No paint or fill is visible in the object or stroke. <br>This means that any visible object behind the invisible fill will show through it. <br>Though it may seem counterintuitive, this is not the same as <em>"Unset"</em> since this is actually a fill type rather than no fill type.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <div class="tips">
    <p> Objects set to <em>"No Paint"</em> still act as normal shapes and paths when they are manipulated in path operations. <br>For instance, a boolean operation will react to the path exactly the same whether it has <em>no paint</em> fill or any other kind of fill.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note: any object with 0% opacity (completely transparent) on both fill and stroke is not selectable by normal click selection. <br>Any other selection method should work for transparent objects.</strong>
      <br></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<h4>Plain Color</h4>
<blockquote> <img title="plain" alt="plain" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-plain-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>A solid color paints the object or stroke. <br>In both <span class="green">Fill</span> and <span class="green">Stroke Paint</span> tabs, there are sub-tabs whereby color selections can be made either precisely (with the numeric and alpha-numeric controls) or more generally (with wheels and sliders). <br>Each selector type also shows an RGBA definition box at the bottom-right in which one may define a specific <strong>hexadecimal color</strong>.
    <br></p>
  <ul>
<li>
    <p><strong>RGB</strong> offers four sliders representing percentages of <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, and <strong>alpha</strong>
      <br></p> </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>HSL </strong>offers four sliders representing percentages of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong>, <strong>lightness</strong>, and <strong>alpha</strong>
    </p> </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>CMYK </strong>offers five sliders representing percentages of <strong>cyan</strong>, <strong>magenta</strong>, <strong>yellow</strong>, <strong>black</strong> and <strong>alpha</strong>
    </p> </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Wheel </strong>offers a convenient (though less precise) selection apparatus consisting of a <strong>hue</strong> wheel and a combination <strong>saturation/lightness</strong> triangle, underneath which is an <strong>alpha</strong> slider
      <br></p> </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>CMS</strong> (only available in some distributions) allows selection of a <strong>color profile</strong> and offers an <strong>alpha</strong> slider underneath
      <br></p> </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Linear Gradient</h4>
<blockquote>  <img title="linear_gradient" alt="linear_gradient" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-linear_gradient-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>linear gradient</strong> paints the object or stroke according to two settings. <br>The <em>gradient selector box</em> chooses the gradient definition to use. <br>The <em>repeat type selector box</em> chooses <strong>none</strong> (the gradient only fills once from it's beginning point to its end point), <strong>direct</strong> (repeats the gradient infinitely, likely causing an abrupt color change at the end of each repetition if the ends are different colors), or <strong>reflected</strong> (repeats the gradient infinitely also, except that each repetition flips the gradient so the color changes are always smooth at the end of each repetition).
  </p>
  <p>The direction and extent of the gradient is adjusted by dragging the handles.
    <br></p>
  <p>Gradients may also be duplicated or edited from this dialog panel using the provided buttons.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Radial Gradient</h4>
<blockquote>  <img title="radial_gradient" alt="radial_gradient" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-radial_gradient-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>This panel works the same as linear gradient except that the gradient is applied <em>radially</em>.
  </p>
  <p>The elliptical "shape", placement and extent of the radius is controlled by the three handles.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Pattern</h4>
<blockquote> <img title="pattern_fill" alt="pattern_fill" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-pattern_fill-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>An SVG or bitmap pattern, selected from the selection box, paints the object. <br>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To create your own pattern, select the object from which the pattern will be created. <br>Then select <span class="blue">Object</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Pattern</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Object to Pattern</span> or press<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">I</span>. <br>Your object will dissapear from the canvas and appear on the list of patterns.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To do the reverse, select <span class="blue">Object</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Pattern</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Pattern to Object</span> or press <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Alt</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">I</span>.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="tips">If the object filled with pattern is transformed, the pattern will be also. <br>If you don't want the pattern to be transformed, uncheck "Transform patterns" from the <span class="green">Transforms</span> tab in the <span class="green">Preferences</span> dialog.
    <br>
</div>
  <p>
  </p>
  <input name="render" value="sidebyside" type="hidden"><input name="type" value="diff" type="hidden"><p>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Unset</h4>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><img title="unset_fill" alt="unset_fill" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-unset_fill-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Unset</strong> fill is applied to a master object of clones in order to make the clones paintable. <br>This must be applied individually to the object's fill and stroke to affect each. <br>This will make the object's fill appear black and its stroke appear invisible.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Even-Odd</h4>
<blockquote> <img title="even_odd" alt="even_odd" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-even_odd-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>This setting is available only for an object's Fill. <br>It causes the fill to be completely transparent wherever a path crosses over itself.
    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Non-Zero</h4>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img title="non_zero" alt="non_zero" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-non_zero-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p>This setting is available only for an object's Fill. <br>It causes the fill to be shown wherever a path crosses over itself. <br>This is the default setting.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Blur</h4>
<blockquote> <img title="blur" alt="blur" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-blur-en.png">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blur</strong> is not actually a paint function at all - it is actually an <strong>SVG filter effect</strong>. <br>However, it makes sense in <span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span>, since it is a very commonly useful visual effect. <br>It is also important to note that <strong><em>blur affects the entire object</em></strong>, not just the fill or the stroke, and cannot be applied separately to either.
    <br></p>
  <p>Apply blur by dragging the slider or setting the number box to the desired blur factor. <br>Usually only a small factor (0-10) is needed.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Opacity</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><img title="opacity" alt="opacity" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/fill-and-stroke/static/Inkscape-PaintFill-opacity-en.png"> 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Opacity</strong> sets the degree to which objects behind the affected object may be seen through it.
  </p>
  <p>This <strong>opacity</strong> setting is separate from the color alpha setting, which is particular to either the fill or stroke paint. <br>Like blur, <strong><em>opacity applies to the entire object</em></strong>, affecting both fill and stroke together.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>

<title>Inkscape: StrokeStyle</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Stroke Style</h2>
<p>Object <strong>strokes</strong> or <strong>outlines</strong> can have various styles applied to them from the <span class="green">Stroke Style</span> panel on the <span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog. <br>(<strong>Stroke paint</strong> is applied from the <span class="green">Stroke Paint</span> dialog and is not covered in this chapter.)
</p>
<p>The center of an object's stroke follows the path of the object. <br>For example, if the stroke is 10 pixels wide, the stroke will be drawn 5 pixels in opposite directions on either side of the path. <br>
</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>While an object is selected, activate the <span class="green">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog by pressing <span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Shift</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">Ctrl</span>+<span class="keyboard_shortcuts">F</span> or selecting <em></em><span class="blue"><em>Object</em></span> &gt; <span class="blue"><em>Fill and Stroke</em></span><em></em>. <br>Changes in the dialogue will immediately affect the selected object(s).
  <br></p>
<p> <img title="strokestyle" alt="strokestyle" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/stroke-style/static/Inkscape-StrokeStyle-strokestyle-en.png"><br></p>
<p> A brief list of stroke style options follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Width</strong> controls how thick the stroke is and your desired measurement unit.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Join</strong> controls the type of angle on a non-curve joint - <strong>miter</strong> (angled corners), <strong>round</strong> (rounded corners) or <strong>bevel</strong> (flat corners). <br>This affects the outside of the join only.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Miter limit</strong> keeps corners mitered at set limits of corner angle; the higher the miter limit setting, the sharper the corner can be while retaining its miter. <br></li>
  <li>
<strong>Cap</strong> controls the type of cap that is on the end of an open path - <strong>butt cap</strong> (flat), <strong>round cap</strong> (half-circle) or <strong>end cap</strong> (flat but extended).
  <br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Dashes</strong> controls the dash pattern and its offset from the primary node.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Start Markers</strong>, <strong>Mid Markers</strong> and <strong>End Markers</strong> set a marker selection from the dropdown (there is a pre-set selection of arrow-heads, etc). <br>Mid Markers places only one marker at the middle of the path.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Creating New Markers</h4>
<div class="tips">Create your object on the canvas, select it and then select <span class="blue">Object</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Objects to marker</span>. <br>Your marker will appear in the selection box for markers.
</div>
<div class="tips">If you are putting markers on a path and want to match them to the color of the path, select  <span class="blue">Effects</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Modify Path</span> &gt; <span class="blue">Color Markers</span>.

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>
<span class="mw-headline">Gears</span></h2>
<p>The <strong>Gears</strong> effect is a toy effect. <br>It generates a chain of interconnected gears from the path that has the effect applied to it. <br>The nodes of the path define the centers of the gears. <br>The first 3 nodes are special; the first defines the start angle of the chain, the second defines the center of the first gear and the third knot specifies the radius of the first gear. <br>That is, to create a chain of 2 gears, you will need a path with 4 nodes; for 3 gears, 5 nodes, and so on.

<h2>
<span class="editsection"></span><span class="mw-headline">Pattern along path</span></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h4></h4>
<p>The <strong>Pattern along Path</strong> effect can curve a path along another path. <br>When this effect is applied to path A (called <em>skeleton</em>), another path B (called <em>pattern</em>) can then be passed as a parameter. <br>The result is that path B is bent along path A. <br>With the node edit tool, path A can be changed <strong>on-canvas</strong> and the result is <strong>updated live</strong>. <br>This provides a direct equivalent of "vector brushes" or "skeletal strokes" features in other vector editors.
</p>
<p>In the effect's control panel in the Path Effects dialog, you can select how many copies of the pattern are attached (either <strong>single</strong> or <strong>repeated</strong>) and whether the pattern is <strong>stretched</strong> to fill the skeleton path. <br>You can also choose the pattern for the selected skeleton [either directly or] by <strong>pasting</strong> it from clipboard (that is, you select and copy to the clipboard the pattern, then select the skeleton, apply the Path along path effect, and paste the pattern). <br>The <strong>Scale width</strong> parameter allows you to change the width of the pattern applied to the path.

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Knot LPE</h2>
<p>Creates a knot from a flat self-intersecting curve: at each crossing, one strand is interrupted to make it look like it's going under the other. <br>The "sign" of each crossing (first strand interrupted, second interrupted, or no interruptions) can be set independently by clicking the on-screen handle which can be dragged from one crossing to the other.<em></em>
</p>
<p><em>Warning</em>: as far as possible, the LPE tries to keep the modifications of crossing signs unchanged under small deformations. <br>For large or topology changing deformations however, some or all crossings might jump back to their default orientation.

<h2> Color Management</h2>
<h3>Operation Systems Support</h3>
<p>Сolor management is supported in Linux and Mac OS X only in version 0.46 and in Windows in version 0.47+.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites </h3>
<p>*.icc color profile files need to be present in one of the following folders to be listed in the preferences dialog dropdown menus.
</p>
<h5> Linux:<em></em></h5>
<p><em>/home/<strong>&lt;user&gt;</strong>/.local/share/color/icc
  <br>/home/<strong>&lt;user&gt;</strong>/.config/.color/icc
  <br>/usr/local/share/color/icc

<h3>Calibrated SVG Color including CMYK
  <br></h3>
<p>Inkscape supports color-managed color definitions that use a colorspace other than sRGB (for example Adobe RGB, or calibrated CMYK colors). <br>In the SVG file, this is done using the optional "icc-color(...)" paint components as described in section 11.2 "Specifying paint" of the SVG 1.1 specification. <br>A fallback sRGB value will be used for non color managed workflows. <br>This allows using of calibrated color spaces, including using CMYK values that are preserved across applications.
</p>
<p>The CMS color selector tab allows these colors to be edited.
</p>

<h3>Display Adjustment</h3>
<p><span class="blue">Color Management</span> tab in <span class="blue">Inkscape Preferences</span> dialog provides options for enabling display adjustment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Display Profile</strong>. <br>Here you set an ICC file for you calibrated and profile display.
  <br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Retrieve profile from display</strong>. <br>On X11-based systems (i.e. <br>Unix and Mac OSX) use of <a href="http://www.burtonini.com/computing/x-icc-profiles-spec-latest.html" class="external text" title="http://www.burtonini.com/computing/x-icc-profiles-spec-latest.html" rel="nofollow">ICC Profiles In X Specification</a> (or XICC) can be enabled. <br>Support for version 0.2 of this specification has been implemented. <br>Enabling this option by choosing to retrieve profiles from the display will switch Inkscape to using profiles attached to screens at runtime. <br>These allow display adjustment to be changed on the fly, and to be set/cleared per-display. <br>This is especially helpful for a multi-display configuration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>When XICC support is enabled, windows will adjust to the proper profile as they are moved across monitors. <br>Also, as the windows are moved onto monitors with no profile attached, the adjustment toggle will become disabled. <br>When the windows are moved onto screens that do have profiles, the toggle will become enabled.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
  <p><strong>Display  Rendering Intent</strong>. <br>You can choose between <strong>Perceptual</strong>, <strong>Relative Colorimetric</strong>, <strong>Saturation</strong> and <strong>Absolute Colorimetric</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>
<strong>Perceptual</strong> intent prevents from gamut clipping by preserving relationships between color.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Saturation</strong> intent preserves saturation and best suits for illustrations with indexed color palette like logos.
    <br>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Relative</strong> colorimetric intent maps original white color to color of the paper and translates other colors accordingly.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Absolute</strong> colorimetric intent tries to produce closest match, but suits mostly spot color workflows.
    <br>
</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has to be noted that display adjustment is enabled and disabled for each Inkscape's window. <br>This allows for simultaneous viewing of adjusted and unadjusted views of a single document by using multiple windows. <br>There is a toggle at the bottom-right corner of the scrollbars that allows for turning on and off display adjustment. <br>The toggle will have a disabled state to provide visible feedback when no profile is set.
  <br></p>
<h3>Proofing</h3>
<p>This section in <span class="blue">Color Management</span> tab allows defining settings for an output device such as printer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> Simulate output on screen</strong> option enables softproofing, that is — the document will look exactly as it will be outputted to printer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Mark out of gamut colors</strong>. <br>All devices have a unique set of colors (gamut) they can reproduce, be it a display or a printer. <br>This option enables marking the colors that cannot be reproduced in destination color space with a user defined color. <br>By default neutral grey color is used.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Device profile</strong>. <br>This is an ICC profile for the output device (usually, a printer). <br>For Europe the <strong>Euroscale Uncoated v2</strong> profile is recommended to be used by default, and for USA — <strong>U.S. <br>Web Coated (SWOP) v2</strong> or  <strong>U.S. <br>Sheet-fed Coated v2</strong>.
  <br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Device Rendering Intent</strong>. <br>You can choose between Perceptual, Relative Colorimetric, Saturation and Absolute Colorimetric.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Black Point Compensation</strong>. <br>BPC's primary function is to map dynamic range of an image to dynamic range of an output device, so that contrast us not lost. <br>It is usually used for publications with a lot of full color graphics like photos. <br>Note that BPC is used only with <span class="nfakPe">relative</span> <span class="nfakPe">colorimetric</span> rendering intent and should be disabled for other rendering intent types.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Preserve Black</strong>. <br>Makes Inkscape do its best to provide same level of blackness in the output.

<title>Inkscape: GenerateTemplateEffects</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Generate Template</h2>
<p>The only available <strong>extension</strong> to create a <strong>template</strong> right now is <strong>Perfect-Bound Cover</strong> which modifies the document to create a cover for perfect-bound books using US size and paper weight measurements. <br>This extension will resize the document to include the width, height, spine width, and bleed measurements that are provided to the extensions, so it should be the first operation done before designing.
</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to know the <strong>PPI </strong>of the paper stock you’ll be using. <br><strong>Average caliper size</strong> or <strong>point size</strong> (which is <strong>the caliper size times 1000</strong>) are just as good. <br>Your printer should be able to tell you any of these measurements. <br>If not, you’ll have to guess. <br>Or find another printer. <br>If you don’t know the PPI, caliper, or point size of the paper your printer is using, but do know <strong>the type of paper and its weight</strong>, you can estimate PPI or caliper using the charts on the <strong>Case Paper</strong> ( <a href="http://www.casepaper.com/calc_chart_caliper.htm">http://www.casepaper.com/calc_chart_caliper.htm</a> ) or the <strong>Micro Format</strong> ( <a href="http://www.paper-paper.com/weight.html">http://www.paper-paper.com/weight.html</a> ) site.
</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say your printer uses <strong>20# bond paper</strong>, a pretty standard paper weight, to print the interior pages of your 200 page book. <br>Most likely, the caliper size of this paper is <strong>.004</strong>, but again, <em>verify this with your printer before proceeding</em>. <br>Calculate the PPI by diving the number 2 by the caliper size:
</p>
<p><strong>2/.004 = 500</strong>
</p>
<p>The PPI of this paper is <strong>500</strong>, which means that, for <strong>every 500 pages</strong> in your book, the spine will be <strong>1 inch thick</strong>.
</p>
<p>Now, with the PPI, you can calculate the thickness of the spine, without the allowance for the cover. <br>The size of the spine for the interior pages will be:
</p>
<p><strong>200/500 = .4 inches
  <br></strong>
</p>
<p>Next, do the same for the cover. <br>Let’s say your cover is going to be printed on 9pt paper stock. <br>Points to caliper is a really easy conversion — <strong>divide the points by 1000</strong> to get .009, then calculate:
</p>
<p><strong>2/.009 = 222</strong>
</p>
<p>Since the cover is four “pages” (outside and inside covers), the additional inches you need to add to the spine will be:
</p>
<p><strong>4/222 = .018</strong>
</p>
<p>So your final spine width in inches for a 200 page book printed on 20# bond with a cover that is printed on 9pt stock is:
</p>
<p><strong>(200 / (2/.004)) + (4 / (2/.009)) = .418</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>.4 + .018 = .418 inches
  <br></strong>
</p>
<p>All this is different in metric.
</p>
<p>Let's take an example. <br>You have a 6″x9″ book with 176 pages to be printed on paper with a PPI of 426 and the cover — on 9pt stock. <br>You also need 1/8″ bleeds. <br>Here’s how you would set up the document:
</p>
<p><img title="perfect_bound_cover_01_en" alt="perfect_bound_cover_01_en" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/generate-template/static/openoffice-GenerateTemplate-perfect_bound_cover_01_en-en.png"><br></p>
<p>And here is how the final document looks:
</p>
<p><img title="perfect_bound_cover_02" alt="perfect_bound_cover_02" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/generate-template/static/openoffice-GenerateTemplate-perfect_bound_cover_02-en.png"><br></p>
<p>You can also use the <strong>Live Preview</strong> option to see what you get.

<title>Inkscape: InstallWindows</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2> Installing Inkscape on Windows</h2>
<p> <strong>Software name :</strong> Inkscape
  <br><strong>Homepage :</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inkscape.org/">http://www.inkscape.org/</a>
  <br><strong>Software version used for this installation :</strong> 0.46
  <br><strong>Operating System use for this installation :</strong> Microsoft Windows (2000)
  <br><strong>Recommended Hardware :</strong> 200 Mhz processor (CPU) minimum
</p>
<p> Installing Inkscape is relatively easy. <br>You need only an internet connection and browser. <br>First visit the download page of Inkscape :  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inkscape.org/download/">http://www.inkscape.org/download/</a>
</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inkscape.org/download/"><img class="c1" title="homepage" alt="homepage" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-homepage-en.png"></a>
</p>
<p>Now scroll down to the Official Releases' section to the link that says 'Windows' :
</p>
<p><img title="windowslink" alt="windowslink" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-windowslink-en.png"></p>
<p>We will choose the '.exe installer' so click on this. <br>You will be redirected to a 'SourceForge' page. <br>This is where the installation files are hosted :
</p>
<p><img title="sf" alt="sf" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-sf-en.png"></p>
<p>The download will begin automatically. <br>You chould see a dialog like this (it may look different according to the browser you are using):
</p>
<p><img title="download" alt="download" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-download-en.png"></p>
<p>Press 'Save File'. <br>Your installation file will start downloading. <br>You need to know where the file is downloading to. <br>If you know where this is then you need to find the file on your computer. <br>You should see an icon like this :
</p>
<p><img title="icon" alt="icon" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-icon-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>Now you need to double-click on tis icon and the installation process will begin. <br>
</p>
<p><img title="1" alt="1" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-1-en.png"></p>
<p>You can click through the above introduction screen.
</p>
<p><img title="2" alt="2" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-2-en.png"></p>
<p>The above is just the license agreement. <br>If you don't agree to it then press cancel but this means you will not be able to install the software. <br>If you wish to install the  software click 'Next &gt;' :
</p>
<p><img title="3" alt="3" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-3-en.png"><br></p>
<p>The entire installation size is listed here as 215.9MB. <br>If this is too big then you may wish to turn off some of the boxes with green arrows. <br>The items with green arrows are optional, the best saving would be to turn of all the Translations (saves 45MB) - however this means you will not be able to use Inkscape in any language other than english. <br>When you finished with the options click 'Next &gt;' :
</p>
<p><img title="4" alt="4" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-4-en.png"></p>
<p> The above window just tells you where Inkscape will be installed. <br>Unless you have good reason to change the above settings then it is better to leave it as it is and press 'Install'. <br>Then the installation window appears and reports the progress:
</p>
<p><img title="5" alt="5" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-5-en.png"><br></p>
<p> When the install has finished you will see the following:
</p>
<p><img title="6" alt="6" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/installing-on-windows/static/Inkscape-InstallingWin-6-en.png"></p>
<p>To run Inkscape just leave the 'Run Inkscape 0.46' and press 'Finish'. <br>Inkscape then appears:

<title>Inkscape: CreateIcon</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<h2>Create a Basic Icon</h2>
<p><strong>Inkscape</strong> is an excellent tool for creating icons. <br>Generally speaking icons are required in different formats so that makes <strong>SVG</strong> an excellent format as it is a scalable graphics format. <br>This means you can shrink or enlarge the graphic to the required size without losing any quality.
</p>
<p>This tutorial was made with Ubuntu, but works with any operating system supported by Inkscape. <br>In this case, only the way you open Inkscape and the general look and feel may be different.
</p>
<h3>Create New Icon File </h3>
<p>First open Inkscape and to create a new file. <br>Click on the <u>F</u>ile menu and choose '<u>N</u>ew' and then 'icon_32x32'.
</p>
<p><img title="newicon" alt="newicon" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-newicon-en.png"></p>
<p>A new blank file will then open with, in this example, a grid:
</p>
<p><img title="new_icon_blank" alt="new_icon_blank" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-new_icon_blank-en.png"></p>
<p>The grid is a 32x32 block grid, the same size as many of the icons you will find on your computer. <br>The lines in this grid will not appear when the final image is exported to another type of file such as JPEG  or GIF. <br>The grid is just there to help you create the square icon within the standard 32x32 pixel dimensions. <br>It's possible to add or remove the grid using the <u>'V</u>iew&gt;<u>G</u>rid' menu<em></em>.
</p>
<h3>Save the File</h3>
<p>Before you start work it is a good idea to first save the file. <br>Even though the content of the file is empty it is good practice to always save the file before you start so that you can easily save the changes as you go. <br>By doing this you ensure yourself against losing your work if your computer crashes or turns off unintentionally. <br>Save the file by clicking on '<u>F</u>ile' and 'Save As...' :
</p>
<p><img title="saveas" alt="saveas" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-saveas-en.png"></p>
<p>This will pop open a dialog box. <br>The style of your dialog may differ from the following :
</p>
<p><img title="saveasdialog" alt="saveasdialog" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-saveasdialog-en.png"> 
</p>
<p>You can change the name of the file to anything to help you identify it (in the above example it is 'drawing.svg'). <br>Make sure when you save it the file name has '.svg' at the end. <br>You can also click through the folders on your computer using this dialog box until you find the folder where you wish to save the file. <br>When you have the right location click 'Save'.
</p>
<h3>Using the Icon Preview Window
  <br></h3>
<p>If you are going to be exporting the image into a bitmap version and using it for multiple reasons, it may be important to know how it will turn out as a icon during the creation process. <br>Therefore Inkscape has the added feature of a bitmap previewer. <br>This window will let you see what your icon will look like in the 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48 and 128x128 common size views. <br>Located in the Menu through: <img alt="iconpreviewer.png" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-Icon_Previewer-iconpreviewer-en.png" align="absmiddle"> View &gt; Ico<u>n</u> Preview...
</p>
<h3>Start Work</h3>
<p>Now we will proceed to draw the icon. <br>You can choose any of the tools for creating shapes and colors. <br>Currently icons that look three dimensional are very popular but we will look at creating a very two dimensional icon. <br>So lets make a simple radio icon. <br>It will end up looking something like this:
</p>
<p><img title="radio" alt="radio" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-radio-en.png"></p>
<p>Lets start with making the background circle. <br>Choose the circle tool from the tool bar on the left of Inkscape:
</p>
<p><img title="circletool" alt="circletool" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circletool-en.png"></p>
<p>With this tool selected you need to click in one of the corners of the grid and drag to the diagonally opposite corner. <br>It might take a bit of practice until you have this right. <br>The end result should look something like this:
</p>
<p><img title="circle1" alt="circle1" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle1-en.png"></p>
<p>You may have a dark line around the outside of the circle. <br>If you do we will look at how to remove this shortly. <br>For now we will change the color of the circle to the desired color. <br>I will choose the HTML color code '#ff7f00'. <br>You may wish to choose another color. <br>To change the color of the circle you must right-click on the circle and choose 'Fill and Stroke':
</p>
<p><img title="fillstroke" alt="fillstroke" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-fillstroke-en.png"><br></p>
<p>The following dialog should appear:
</p>
<p><img title="fs2" alt="fs2" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-fs2-en.png"></p>
<p>I know the HTML color code is the equivalent to the RGB code + 'ff'. <br>So I will add 'ff7f00ff' to the RGBA box near the bottom :
</p>
<p><img title="rgbbox" alt="rgbbox" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-rgbbox-en.png"></p>
<p>If you know your HTML color code then add it here. <br>Otherwise you can use the RGB sliders to choose a color. <br>As you change the values you will see the color of the circle change simultaneously. <br>If you had a line around the outside of the circle when you created it you can now delete it by clicking on the 'Stroke st<u>y</u>le' tab and set the 'Width' box (at the top of the tab) to 0 (zero) px. <br>When you are happy with the color of the circle just move the 'Fill and Stroke' dialog to the side (if you have enough room on your screen) or close it. <br>We will use it again a little later.
</p>
<p>My colored circle now looks like this :
</p>
<p><img title="circle2" alt="circle2" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle2-en.png"></p>
<p>Now we wish to add the radio to the middle of our circle. <br>We will first add a black box with rounded corners to the middle of the circle. <br>Click on the 'Square and Rectangle' tool on the left :
</p>
<p>
  <br><img title="squaretool" alt="squaretool" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-squaretool-en.png"></p>
<p>Now click somewhere in the circle and drag the mouse in a diagonal towards the bottom of the page. <br>You are now creating the square but you will not see anything happening on the screen so you have to guess the approximate distance you drag before you release the mouse. <br>You should see something like this :
</p>
<p><img title="circle3a" alt="circle3a" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle3a-en.png"><br></p>
<p>Now, return to the 'Fill and Stroke' dialog box and change the value of the RGBA box (In the 'Fill' tabe') to "000000ff" :
</p>
<p><img title="rgbbox2" alt="rgbbox2" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-rgbbox2-en.png"></p>
<p>Now the square should appear black :
</p>
<p> <img title="circle4" alt="circle4" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle4-en.png"></p>
<p>You could also have used the color sliders to choose a color.
</p>
<p>Now we wish to make nice rounded corners on the black box. <br>To do this mouse over the small round circle at the top right of the black box. <br>It should go 'red' :
</p>
<p><img title="sqtoolred" alt="sqtoolred" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-sqtoolred-en.png"></p>
<p>Click on the circle when it is red and drag it vertically down and you will all the corners of the black box change to rounded corners as you drag. <br>When you are satisfied with the amount of 'rounding' release the mouse button :
</p>
<p><img title="circle5" alt="circle5" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle5-en.png"></p>
<p>Now we need to create three white circles for the 'dial' and 'tuning buttons' of the radio. <br>Do this using the same method as you used for creating the first large circle, except you want to try and create them in the right place in the black box. <br>
</p>
<p><img title="circle6" alt="circle6" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle6-en.png"></p>
<p>Now we want an antenna on the top right. <br>We will use the pencil tool that you will also find on the left tool bar:
</p>
<p><img title="penciltool" alt="penciltool" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-penciltool-en.png"></p>
<p>To draw a straight line click where you wish the line to start and then click again where you wish it to finish:
</p>
<p><img title="cirlce7" alt="cirlce7" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-cirlce7-en.png"></p>
<p>Now we wish to give the antenna a nice circular tip so we return to the 'Fill and Stroke' dialog and look at the 'Stroke style' tab. <br>You will notice here a 'cap' section :
</p>
<p><img title="cap" alt="cap" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-cap-en.png"></p>
<p>Click on the middle box in this section and your antenna will be instantly rounded :
</p>
<p><img title="circle8" alt="circle8" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-circle8-en.png"> 
</p>
<h3>Exporting to PNG</h3>
<p>We will now export this to a PNG. <br>You may wish to use another graphic file format however Inkscape will only support export to PNG. <br>To convert the image to another format you will need to use an image software such as <strong>GIMP</strong>.
</p>
<p>Choose '<u>F</u>ile' and 'Export Bitmap...':
</p>
<p><img title="export" alt="export" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-export-en.png"></p>
<p>You will see a dialog appear like this:
</p>
<p><img title="export2" alt="export2" src="http://write.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/creating-icons/static/Inkscape-CreateIcon-export2-en.png"></p>
<p>If you just pressed 'Export' right now you would export a 32x32 PNG to the folder '/home/folder'. <br>You can change any of these settings. <br>To change the dimensions of the image click on the arrows next to the <u>W</u>idth and <u>H</u>eight boxes. <br>To change the file name and the location you wish to export the file to you must click on the '<u>B</u>rowse' button.
