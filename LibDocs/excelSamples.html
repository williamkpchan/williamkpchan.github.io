<h2>AutoFit</h2>
<a href="#autofit-column-width">AutoFit Column Width</a>  |  <a href="#autofit-row-height">AutoFit Row Height</a>
You probably know how to change the width of a column in <k>Excel</k>, but do you also know how to <k>automatically fit</k> the widest entry in a column?
<h3>AutoFit Column Width</h3>
The default width of a column is 64 pixels.

1. You can change the width of a column by clicking and dragging the right border of the column header.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/change-column-width.png">

2. To automatically fit the widest entry in a column, double click the right border of a column header.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/autofit-column.png">

3. To autofit multiple columns, first select multiple columns by clicking and dragging over the column headers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/select-multiple-columns.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to select non-adjacent columns, hold CTRL while clicking the column headers.

4. Next, double click the right border of one of the column headers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/autofit-multiple-columns.png" loading="lazy">

5. To change the width of all columns, first select all columns by clicking the Select All button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/select-all-columns.png" loading="lazy">

6. Next, change the width of a column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/change-width-of-all-columns.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>AutoFit Row Height</h3>
The techniques described above can also be used to change the height of a row.
Instead of clicking the right border of a column header, simply click the bottom border of a row header.
There's one more way to autofit columns or rows.

1. First, select multiple rows by clicking and dragging over the row headers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/select-multiple-rows.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Home tab, in the Cells group, click Format.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/click-format.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click AutoFit Row Height.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/click-autofit-row-height.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/autofit/autofit-row-height.png" loading="lazy">
Note: you can also use this technique to set a row height or a column width (see screenshot at step 3).
Be careful, don't think in pixels here.
The default width of a column is 8.43 units and the default height of a row is 15.00 units.
<h2>Transpose</h2>
<a href="#paste-special-transpose">Paste Special Transpose</a> | <a href="#transpose-function">Transpose Function</a> | <a href="#transpose-table-without-zeros">Transpose Table without Zeros</a> | <a href="#transpose-magic">Transpose Magic</a>
Use the '<k>Paste Special Transpose</k>' option to switch rows to columns or columns to rows in <k>Excel</k>.
You can also use the <k>TRANSPOSE function</k>.
<h3>Paste Special Transpose</h3>
To transpose data, execute the following steps.

1. Select the range A1:C1. 

2. Right click, and then click Copy.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/right-click-copy.png">

3. Select cell E2. 

4. Right click, and then click Paste Special.

5. Check Transpose.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/check-transpose.png">

6. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/paste-special-transpose-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Transpose Function</h3>
To insert the TRANSPOSE function, execute the following steps.

1. First, select the new range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/select-new-range.png" loading="lazy">

2. Type in =TRANSPOSE(

3. Select the range A1:C1 and close with a parenthesis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/transpose-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/transpose-function-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
To delete this array formula, select the range E2:E4 and press Delete.

5. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply select cell E2, enter the TRANSPOSE function and press Enter.
Bye bye curly braces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/dynamic-array-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the TRANSPOSE function, entered into cell E2, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h3>Transpose Table without Zeros</h3>
The TRANSPOSE function in Excel converts blank cells to zeros.
Simply use the IF function to fix this problem.

1. For example, cell B4 below is blank.
The TRANSPOSE function converts this blank cell to a zero (cell G3).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/transpose-table.png" loading="lazy">

2. If blank, the IF function below returns an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between) to transpose.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/transpose-table-without-zeros.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Transpose Magic</h3>
The '<a href="transpose.html#paste-special-transpose">Paste Special Transpose</a>' option is a great way to transpose data but if you want to link the source cells to the target cells, you need a few magic tricks.

1. Select the range A1:E2. 

2. Right click, and then click Copy.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/copy-data.png" loading="lazy">

4. Right click, and then click Paste Special.

5. Click Paste Link.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/click-paste-link.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/paste-link-result.png" loading="lazy">

6. Select the range A4:E5 and <a href="../basics/find-select.html#replace">replace</a> all equal signs with xxx.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/replace-all.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/ready-to-transpose.png" loading="lazy">

7. Use '<a href="transpose.html#paste-special-transpose">Paste Special Transpose</a>' to transpose this data.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/transposed-data.png" loading="lazy">

8. Select the range G1:H5 and <a href="../basics/find-select.html#replace">replace</a> all occurrences of 'xxx' with equal signs (the exact opposite of step 6).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transpose/transpose-magic.png" loading="lazy">
Note: for example, change the value in cell C2 from 16 to 36. The value in cell H3 will also change from 16 to 36. 
<h2>Split Cells</h2>
<a href="#split-cell">Split a Cell</a>  |  <a href="#text-to-columns">Text to Columns</a>  |  <a href="#flash-fill">Flash Fill</a>  |  <a href="#formulas-to-split-cells">Formulas to Split Cells</a>
To <k>split a cell in Excel</k>, add a new column, change the column widths and merge cells.
To split the contents of a cell into multiple cells, use the Text to Columns wizard, flash fill or formulas.
<h3>Split a Cell</h3>
Use the following trick to "split" a cell in Excel.

1. For example, task B starts at 13:00 and requires 2 hours to complete.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/split-cell-b3.png">
Suppose task B starts at 13:30. We would like to split cell B3 and color the right half.

7. Repeat steps 5-6 for cell B2 and cell C2 (and cell B4 and cell C4).

8. Change the background color of cell B3 to No Fill.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/split-cell.png" loading="lazy">
Note: suppose task A ends at 15:30. Use the trick explained above to "split" cell E2. Download the Excel file and give it a try.
<h3>Text to Columns</h3>
To <k>split the contents of a cell into multiple cells</k>, use the Text to Columns wizard.
For example, let's split full names into last and first names.
1. Select the range with full names.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/text-to-columns-example.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Text to Columns.

Note: this example has commas and spaces as delimiters.
You may have other delimiters in your data.
Experiment by checking and unchecking the different check boxes.
You get a live preview of how your data will be separated.
<h3>Flash Fill</h3>
Do you like Magic? Instead of using the Text to Columns wizard, use flash fill to quickly <k>split data into multiple columns</k>.

1. First, split the contents of one cell into multiple cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/flash-fill-example.png" loading="lazy">

2. Select cell B1 and press CTRL + E (flash fill shortcut).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/split-data-into-multiple-columns-1.png" loading="lazy">

3. Select cell C1 and press CTRL + E.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/split-data-into-multiple-columns-2.png" loading="lazy">

4. Select cell D1 and press CTRL + E.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/split-data-into-multiple-columns-3.png" loading="lazy">
Note: flash fill in Excel only works when it recognizes a pattern.
Download the Excel file and give it a try.
Visit our page about <a href="flash-fill.html">Flash Fill</a> to learn more about this great Excel tool.
<h3>Formulas to Split Cells</h3>
One drawback when using these tools is that the output will not automatically update when the source data changes.
Create formulas to overcome this limitation.
Let's split full names into first and last names.

1. The formula below returns the first name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/first-name.png" loading="lazy">

2. The formula below returns the last name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/last-name.png" loading="lazy">

3. Select the range B2:C2 and drag it down.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/formulas-to-split-cells.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about <a href="separate-strings.html">separating strings</a> to understand the logic behind these formulas.

4. If you have Excel 365, use the new TEXTSPLIT function to split text into rows or columns using delimiters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/split-cells/textsplit-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the TEXTSPLIT function, entered into cell B2, fills multiple cells (B2 and C2).
Wow! This behavior is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h2>Flash Fill</h2>

<h3>Flash Fill Limitations</h3>
Flash fill in Excel only works when it recognizes a pattern, and sometimes needs a little help.
For example, use flash fill in Excel to extract the numbers in column A below.
1. First, tell Excel what you want to do by entering the value 130 into cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/flash-fill/flash-fill-example-6.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Flash Fill (or press CTRL + E).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/flash-fill/click-flash-fill.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/flash-fill/flash-fill-result-6.png" loading="lazy">
Note: flash fill did not correctly extract the decimal numbers (only the digits after the decimal point).

3. Immediately after executing step 2, change the value in cell B3 to 26.2 and Excel will correctly extract all other decimal numbers for you.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/flash-fill/flash-fill-changed-cells.png" loading="lazy">
Finally, flash fill does not automatically update your results when your source data changes.

4. For example, if you change the number in cell A1 to 200, Excel will not update the number in cell B1.

<h2>ROW function</h2>
The <k>ROW function</k> in <k>Excel</k> returns the row number of a reference.
For example, =ROW(C4) returns 4. The ROW function can be quite useful.
1. The ROW function below returns 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/row-function/row-function.png">

2. If the reference is omitted, the ROW function returns the <k>row</k> number of the cell containing the ROW formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/row-function/row-function-without-reference.png">

3. To clearly see this, select cell A2, click on the lower right corner of cell A2, and drag the ROW function down to cell A9. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/row-function/multiple-row-functions.png">

4. If the reference is a range, the ROW function (entered in a single cell) returns the row number of the topmost row.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/row-function/topmost-row.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to return all 5 row numbers, first select the range A1:A5 (or another range of the same size), enter =ROW(C3:F7) and finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply select cell A1, enter =ROW(C3:F7) and press Enter.

5. Don't confuse the ROW function with the ROWS function.
The ROWS function counts the number of rows in a range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/row-function/rows-function.png" loading="lazy">
Why using the ROW function in Excel?

6. For example, you can use the ROW function to <a href="sum-every-nth-row.html">sum every nth row</a> in Excel (in the example below, every 3rd row).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/row-function/sum-every-nth-row.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: use ROW, MOD and conditional formatting to <a href="shade-alternate-rows.html">shade alternate rows</a> in Excel.
<h2>Most Used Functions</h2>

<h2>Subtract</h2>
There's no SUBTRACT function in Excel.
However, there are several ways to <k>subtract</k> numbers in <k>Excel</k>.
Are you ready to improve your Excel skills?

1. For example, the formula below subtracts numbers in a cell.
Simply use the minus sign (-) as the subtraction operator.
Don't forget, always start a formula with an equal sign (=).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtract/subtract-numbers-in-a-cell.png">

2. The formula below subtracts the value in cell A2 and the value in cell A3 from the value in cell A1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtract/subtract-numbers-in-a-range.png">

3. As you can imagine, this formula can get quite long.
Simply use the SUM function to shorten your formula.
For example, the formula below subtracts the values in the range A2:A9 from the value in cell A1. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtract/use-the-sum-function-to-subtract-numbers.png" loading="lazy">

Note: to divide numbers in one column by numbers in another column, at step 9, simply select a range instead of a cell.
<h2>Square Root</h2>
The <k>square root</k> of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number.
The <k>SQRT function</k> in <k>Excel</k> returns the square root of a number.

1. First, to square a number, multiply the number by itself.
For example, 4 * 4 = 16 or 4^2 = 16. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/square-a-number.png">
Note: to insert a caret ^ symbol, press SHIFT + 6. 

2. The square root of 16 is 4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/square-root.png">

3. Instead of using the SQRT function, you could also use an exponent of 1/2. Don't forget the parentheses.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/exponent-of-one-half.png" loading="lazy">

4. If a number is negative, the SQRT function returns the #NUM! error.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/num-error.png" loading="lazy">

5. You can use the <a href="absolute-value.html">ABS function</a> to remove the minus sign (-) from a negative number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/abs-function.png" loading="lazy">
Excel has no built-in function to calculate the nth root of a number.
To calculate the nth root of a number, simply raise that number to the power of 1/n.

6. For example, 5 * 5 * 5 or 5^3 is 5 raised to the third power.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/third-power.png" loading="lazy">

7. The cube root of 125 is 5. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/cube-root.png" loading="lazy">

8. For example, 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 or 2^6 is 2 raised to the sixth power.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/square-root/sixth-power.png" loading="lazy">

9. The sixth root of 64 is 2.

<h3>Status Bar Secrets</h3>
Here's a little secret: Excel uses the status bar in many other situations.
If you don't like this, hide the status bar.

1. For example, filter a <a href="../data-analysis/tables.html">table</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/status-bar/filtered-table.png" loading="lazy">

2. Excel uses the status bar to display the number of visible records.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/status-bar/status-bar-message.png" loading="lazy">

3. Hover over a cell with one or more <a href="comments.html">comments</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/status-bar/comments.png" loading="lazy">

4. Excel uses the status bar to display the name of the author.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/status-bar/new-status-bar-message.png" loading="lazy">

5. If you have Excel 2016, use the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + F1 to hide the ribbon and the status bar.

6. To only hide the status bar, add the following code line to the <a href="../vba/events.html#workbook-open-event">Workbook Open Event</a>:
Application.DisplayStatusBar = False

7. Use the <a href="../vba/examples/statusbar.html">StatusBar property</a> in Excel VBA to display a message on the status bar.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/status-bar/statusbar-property.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if you're new to Excel, you can skip step 6 and step 7. 
<h2>Checkbox</h2>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/checkbox-false.png" loading="lazy">
Note: read on for some cool examples.
<h3>Create a Checklist</h3>
To create a checklist, execute the following steps.

1. Draw a checkbox in cell B2. 

2. Click on the lower right corner of cell B2 and drag it down to cell B11. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/copy-checkbox.png" loading="lazy">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/if-function.png" loading="lazy">

9. Click all the checkboxes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/checklist.png" loading="lazy">
Note: we created a <a href="../data-analysis/conditional-formatting.html">conditional formatting</a> rule to automatically change the background color of cell B16. Try it yourself.
Download the Excel file and test the checklist (second sheet).
<h3>Dynamic Chart</h3>
Let's take a look at one more cool example that uses checkboxes.
A dynamic chart.

1. For example, create a <a href="combination-chart.html">combination chart</a> with two data series (Rainy Days and Profit).

2. Add two checkboxes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/chart-with-checkboxes.png" loading="lazy">

3. Right click the first checkbox and click Format Control.
Link this checkbox to cell B15. 

4. Right click the second checkbox and click Format Control.
Link this checkbox to cell C15. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/link-checkboxes.png" loading="lazy">

5. Uncheck the second checkbox.
Cell C15 below changes to FALSE.
We're now going to create two new data series.

6. Insert the IF function shown below.
Use the <a href="copy-formula.html#fill-handle">fill handle</a> to copy this formula down to cell F13. 

7. Repeat this step for the new Profit data series.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/new-data-series.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if the checkbox is checked, the old and new data series are the same.
If the checkbox is unchecked, the new data series changes to a range with #N/A errors.

8. Use the new data series to create the combination chart.
To achieve this, select the chart, right click, and then click <a href="data-series.html#select-data-source">Select Data</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/dynamic-chart.png" loading="lazy">

9. Uncheck the first checkbox and check the second checkbox.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/uncheck-first-checkbox-check-second-checkbox.png" loading="lazy">
Note: try it yourself.
Download the Excel file and test the dynamic chart (third sheet).
<h3>Delete Checkboxes</h3>
To delete multiple checkboxes, execute the following steps.

1. Hold down CTRL and use the left mouse button to select multiple checkboxes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/select-multiple-checkboxes.png" loading="lazy">

2. Press Delete.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/delete-checkboxes.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Powerful Checkboxes</h3>
Finally, you can use VBA to create powerful checkboxes in Excel.
Instead of inserting a Form control, simply insert an ActiveX control.

1. Insert a <a href="../vba/examples/check-box.html">checkbox (ActiveX control)</a>.

2. At step 6, you can add your own code lines to automate all kinds of tasks.
For example, add the following code lines to hide and unhide column F.If CheckBox1.Value = True Then Columns("F").Hidden = True
If CheckBox1.Value = False Then Columns("F").Hidden = False

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/use-checkbox-to-hide-column.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/checkbox/use-checkbox-to-unhide-column.png" loading="lazy">
Note: maybe coding is one step too far for you at this stage, but it shows you one of the many other powerful features Excel has to offer.

<h2>Group Worksheets</h2>
You can <k>group worksheets</k> in <k>Excel</k> if you want to edit multiple worksheets at the same time.
Our workbook contains 3 similar worksheets (North, Mid and South) and a blank fourth worksheet.

1. To group worksheets, hold down CTRL and click the sheet tabs of the sheets you want to group.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/group-worksheets/group-worksheets.png">

2. Release CTRL.
Now you can edit <k>multiple worksheets</k> at the same time.

3. For example, on the North sheet, change the value of cell B2 to $1000 and delete row 4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/group-worksheets/north.png">

4. Go to the other two worksheets and you'll see that these worksheets have been edited as well.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/group-worksheets/mid.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/group-worksheets/south.png" loading="lazy">

5. To ungroup, right click one of the sheet tabs and click Ungroup Sheets or click any sheet tab outside the group.
For example, the sheet tab of Sheet4. <h2>Consolidate</h2>
You can use <k>Excel's Consolidate</k> feature to consolidate your <k>worksheets</k> (located in one workbook or multiple workbooks) into one worksheet.
Below you can find the workbooks of three districts.
Before you start: if your worksheets are identical, it's probably easier to create <a href="3d-reference.html">3D-references</a> (if you have one workbook) or <a href="external-references.html">External References</a> (if you have multiple workbooks) to consolidate your data.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/district1.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/district2.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/district3.png" loading="lazy">
As you can see, the worksheets are not identical.
However, the beauty of the Consolidate feature is that it can easily sum, count, average, etc this data by looking at the labels.
This is a lot easier than creating formulas.

1. Open all three workbooks.

2. Open a blank workbook.
On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Consolidate.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/click-consolidate.png" loading="lazy">

3. Choose the Sum function to sum the data.

4. Click in the Reference box, select the range A1:E4 in the district1 workbook, and click Add.

5. Repeat step 4 for the district2 and district3 workbook.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/add-references.png" loading="lazy">

6. Check Top row, Left column and Create links to source data.
Note: if you don't check Top row and Left column, Excel sums all cells that have the same position.
For example,  cell B2 (in district1.xlsx) + cell B2 (in district2.xlsx) + cell B2 (in district3.xlsx).Because our worksheets are not identical, we want Excel to sum cells that have the same labels.
If you check Create links to source data, Excel creates a link to your source data (your consolidated data will be updated if your source data changes) and creates an <a href="outlining-data.html">outline</a>.

7. Click OK.
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/collapsed-consolidated-data.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/consolidate/expanded-consolidated-data.png" loading="lazy">

8. To quickly move to the next worksheet, press CTRL + Page Down.

9. To quickly move to the previous worksheet, press CTRL + Page Up.
<h2>Get Sheet Name</h2>
To <k>return the sheet name</k> in a cell, use CELL, FIND and MID in <k>Excel</k>.
There's no built-in function in Excel that can <k>get the sheet name</k>.

1. The CELL function below returns the complete path, workbook name and current worksheet name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/get-sheet-name/cell-function.png">
Note: instead of using A1, you can refer to any cell on the first worksheet to get the name of this worksheet.

2. Use the FIND function to find the position of the right bracket.
Add 1 to return the start position of the sheet name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/get-sheet-name/find-function.png">

3. To extract a substring, starting in the middle of a string, use the MID function.
First argument (formula from step 1).
Second argument (formula from step 2).
Third argument (31).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/get-sheet-name/get-name-of-current-worksheet.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the MID function shown above starts at position 24 and extracts 31 characters (maximum length of a worksheet name).

4. You may want to add text to the name of the sheet.
Simply use the ampersand (&amp;) operator as shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/get-sheet-name/add-text-to-sheet-name.png" loading="lazy">

5. To get the name of the second worksheet, simply refer to any cell on the second worksheet.

<h2>Decimal Places</h2>
<a href="#decrease-decimal">Decrease Decimal</a>  |  <a href="#increase-decimal">Increase Decimal</a>  |  <a href="#useful-functions">Useful Functions</a>
Learn how to show fewer or more <k>decimal places</k> in <k>Excel</k> without changing the number itself.
You can also <a href="../functions/round.html">round</a> a number.
<h3>Decrease Decimal</h3>
To decrease the number of decimal places displayed for a cell, simply click the Decrease Decimal button in Excel.

1. For example, enter the value 2.175 into cell A1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/three-decimal-places.png">

2. On the Home tab, in the Number group, click the Decrease Decimal button twice.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/decrease-decimal.png">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/one-decimal-place.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if you look at the formula bar, you can see that cell A1 still contains the value 2.175. 

3. We can still use this underlying precise value in calculations.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/calculation.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if you want to use 2.2 to get a result of 6.6, <a href="../functions/round.html">round</a> the value in cell A1. 
<h3>Increase Decimal</h3>
To show more decimal places, use the <k>Increase Decimal</k> button in Excel.

1. For example, select the range B1:B5 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/integers.png" loading="lazy">
Note: these numbers look like integers (whole numbers).

2. On the Home tab, in the Number group, click the Increase Decimal button six times.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/increase-decimal.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/show-more-decimals.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel stores the exact values of numbers, even if you can't see all the decimal places (except when you're using functions to change the number of decimal places, which we will see next).
<h3>Useful Functions</h3>
Excel offers several useful functions to <k>change the number of decimal places</k> of a number.

1. The ROUND function below rounds a number to two decimal places.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/round-to-two-decimal-places.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if you round a number, you lose precision.
For example, if you're using the value in cell B1 in calculations, Excel uses the value 114.73 (not 114.7261).
2. The TRUNC function in Excel removes decimal places from a given number (without rounding).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/remove-decimals.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if you use the TRUNC function, you lose precision.
Use the second argument to specify how many decimals you want to keep.

3. To extract only the decimal part of a number, use the following formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/decimal-places/decimal-part.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: visit our chapter about <a href="../functions/round.html">rounding numbers in Excel</a> for more information and examples.
<h2>Fractions</h2>
This example teaches you how to enter a <k>fraction in Excel</k> and how to change the format of a fraction.

1. To enter the mixed fraction 1 4/7 (one and four sevenths), type 1 4/7. To enter the <k>fraction 4/7</k> (four sevenths) into cell A1, select cell A1 and type 0 4/7 (with a 0 or Excel thinks you want to enter a date).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/fraction.png">
Now that you've entered a fraction correctly, Excel has applied a <k>Fraction format</k> to cell A1 and you can edit the fraction by simply typing 5/7 (without a 0).
You can find the decimal value of the fraction in the formula bar.

2. Let's take a look at the applied Fraction format.
Select cell A1, right click, and then click Format Cells.
Excel has applied the Up to one digit type.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/fraction-format.png">
Note: to enter a fraction like 4/11 into cell A1, change the type to Up to two digits.
To enter a fraction like 1/148 into cell A1, change the type to Up to three digits.

3a.
Excel rounds your fraction if it cannot display the right fraction.
For example, if you type 4/11 into cell A1 (with the Up to one digit type applied), Excel displays 1/3. The formula bar always shows the correct decimal value.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/rounded-fraction.png" loading="lazy">

3b.
Change the type to Up to two digits.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/correct-fraction.png" loading="lazy">
Note: of course, if you type 0 4/11 into a new cell, Excel automatically applies the Up to two digits type and correctly displays 4/11. 

4. Excel always reduces a fraction to its smallest denominator (bottom number of the fraction).
If you enter the fraction 2/8, Excel converts the fraction to 1/4. However, you can use the As eights (4/8) type to fix the denominator to 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/fixed-denominator.png" loading="lazy">

5. Sometimes, you cannot find the right denominator for your fraction.
For example, you want to display 40/50, but  Excel converts 40/50 to 4/5. However, the As fiftieths (25/50) type is not available.Create a <a href="custom-number-format.html">custom number format</a> (# ??/50) to fix this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/custom-fraction-format.png" loading="lazy">
Note: change the 50 to 60 to create the As sixtieths (30/60) type, etc.
If you don't want to use a fraction in a calculation, but only want to diplay a fraction somewhere on your worksheet, read on.

6. On the Insert tab, in the Symbols group, click the Pi symbol to add a new equation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/insert-equation.png" loading="lazy">

7. Add a fraction to the equation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/add-fraction-to-equation.png" loading="lazy">

8. Add a numerator (top number of the fraction) and a denominator (bottom number of the fraction).
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/fractions/write-fraction.png" loading="lazy">
Note: we increased the font size of the fraction and changed the background color of the cells to White.
<h2>Currency vs Accounting</h2>
The <k>Currency format</k> and the <k>Accounting format</k> in <k>Excel</k> are very similar to each other.
This example shows the difference.

1. Select the range of cells below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/currency-vs-accounting/general-format.png">

2. On the Home tab, in the Number group, apply the Currency format (or press Ctrl + Shift + 4).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/currency-vs-accounting/apply-currency-format.png">
The Currency format places the dollar sign right next to the number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/currency-vs-accounting/currency-format.png">

3. On the Home tab, in the Number group, select Accounting from the drop-down list (or simply click the $ symbol).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/currency-vs-accounting/apply-accounting-format.png" loading="lazy">
The Accounting format aligns dollar signs and decimal points, displays a dash for zero values and displays negative numbers in parentheses.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/currency-vs-accounting/accounting-format.png" loading="lazy">
You can use the Currency format to display negative numbers with a minus sign, in red, with parentheses, or in red with parentheses.

4. Select a cell with a negative number.

<h2>Text to Numbers</h2>
In Excel, text is left-aligned and numbers are right-aligned.
This example teaches you how to <k>convert 'text strings</k> that represent numbers' to <k>numbers</k>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/text-to-numbers-example.png">

1. Select the range A1:A4 and change the <a href="../basics/format-cells.html">number format</a> to General.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/general-format.png">

2. Numbers preceded by an apostrophe are also treated as text.
Select cell A5 and manually remove the apostrophe.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/remove-apostrophe.png" loading="lazy">

3a.
You can also combine step 1 and 2 by adding an empty cell to the range A1:A5. By doing this, you let <k>Excel</k> know that these text strings are numbers.
Copy an empty cell.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/copy-empty-cell.png" loading="lazy">

3b.
Select the range A1:A5, right click, and then click Paste Special.

3c.
Click Add.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/add-empty-cell.png" loading="lazy">

3d.
Click OK.
Result.
All numbers are right-aligned and treated as numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/text-to-numbers-result.png" loading="lazy">

4a.
You can also use the VALUE function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/value-function.png" loading="lazy">

4b.
Here's another example.
Use the RIGHT function (or any other <a href="../functions/text-functions.html">text function</a>) to extract characters from a text string and then use the VALUE function to convert these characters to a number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text-to-numbers/right-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Numbers to Text</h2>
In Excel, numbers are right-aligned and text is left-aligned.
This example teaches you how to <k>convert numbers</k> to <k>'text strings</k> that represent numbers'.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/numbers-to-text-example.png">

1. Select the range A1:A4 and change the <a href="../basics/format-cells.html">number format</a> to Text.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/text-format.png">

2. Precede a number by an apostrophe and it will also be treated as text.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/apostrophe.png" loading="lazy">
3a.
If you add text to a number and still want to format this number, use the <k>TEXT function</k>.
Without using the TEXT function this would be the result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/without-text-function.png" loading="lazy">

3b.
With the TEXT function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/with-text-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: #,## is used to add comma's to large numbers.

3c.
Here's another example.
Apply a percentage format.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/percentage-format.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 0 to display the nearest integer value.
Use 0.0 for one decimal place.
Use 0.00 for two decimal places, etc.

3d.
And another example.
Format a date.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/numbers-to-text/date-format.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use less/more m's, d's and y's to change the appearance of the date.
Visit our page about the <a href="text.html">TEXT function</a> for many more examples.
<h2>Custom Number Format</h2>
<a href="#leading-zeros">Leading Zeros</a> | <a href="#decimal-places">Decimal Places</a> | <a href="#add-text">Add Text</a> | <a href="#large-numbers">Large Numbers</a> | <a href="#repeat-characters">Repeat Characters</a> | <a href="#colors">Colors</a> | <a href="#dates-times">Dates &amp; Times</a>
<k>Excel</k> has many built-in formats that you can use: Currency, Accounting, Date, Time, Percentage, etc.
If you cannot find the right format, you can create a <k>custom number format</k>.
<h3>Leading Zeros</h3>
For example, you might have codes that consist of 5 numbers.Instead of typing 00041, simply type 41 and let Excel add the leading zeros.

1. Enter the value 41 into cell A1. 

2. Select cell A1, right click, and then click Format Cells.

3. Select Custom.

4. Type the following <k>number format code</k>: 00000

5. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/type-the-number-format-code.png">
Note: Excel gives you a live preview of how the number will be <k>formatted</k> (under Sample).
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/leading-zeros.png">
Note: cell A1 still contains the number 41. We only changed the appearance of this number, not the number itself.
<h3>Decimal Places</h3>
You can also control the number of decimal places.
Use 0 to display the nearest integer value.
Use 0.0 for one decimal place.
Use 0.00 for two decimal places, etc.

1. Enter the value 839.1274 into cell A1. 

2. Use the following number format code: 0.00
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/decimal-places.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Add Text</h3>
You can also add text to your numbers.
For example, add "ft".
1. Enter the value 839.1274 into cell A1. 

2. Use the following number format code: 0.0 "ft"
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/add-text.png" loading="lazy">
Note: remember, we only changed the appearance of this number, not the number itself.
You can still use this number in your calculations.
<h3>Large Numbers</h3>
You can also control large numbers.
Use one comma (,) to display thousands and use two commas (,,) to display millions.

1. Enter the following values in cells A1, B1, C1 and D1: 1000000, 2500000, 81000000 and 700000. 

2. Use the following number format code: 0.0,, "M"
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/large-numbers.png" loading="lazy">
Note: we used 0.0 for one decimal place and "M" to add the letter M.
<h3>Repeat Characters</h3>
Use the asterisk (*) followed with a character to fill a cell with that character.

1. Type Hi into cell  A1. 

2. Use the following number format code: @ *-
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/repeat-characters.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the @ symbol is used to get the text input.
<h3>Colors</h3>
You can control positive numbers, negative numbers, zero values and text all at the same time! Each part is separated with a semicolon (;) in your number format code.

1. Enter the following values in cells A1, B1, C1 and A2: 5000000, 0, Hi and -5.89. 

2. Use the following number format code: [Green]$#,##0_);[Red]$(#,##0);"zero";[Blue]"Text:" @
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/colors.png" loading="lazy">
Note: #,## is used to add comma's to large numbers.
To add a space, use the underscore "_" followed by a character.
The length of the space will be the length of this character.
In our example, we added a parenthesis ")".
As a result, the positive number lines up correctly with the negative number enclosed in parentheses.
Use two parts separated with a semicolon (;) to control positive and negative numbers only.
Use three parts separated with a semicolon (;) to control positive numbers, negative numbers and zero values only.
<h3>Dates and Times</h3>
You can also control dates and times.
Use one of the existing Date or Time formats as a starting point.

1. Enter the value 42855 into cell A1. 

2. Select cell A1, right click, and then click Format Cells.

3. Select Date and select the Long Date.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/long-date.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel gives you a live preview of how the number will be formatted (under Sample).

4. Select Custom.

5. Slightly change the number format code to: mm/dd/yyyy, dddd

6. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/custom-date-format.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/custom-number-format/date.png" loading="lazy">
General note: a custom number format is stored in the workbook where you create it.
If you copy a value with a custom number format to another workbook, it will also be available in that workbook.
<h2>Format Painter</h2>

<h2>Search Box</h2>
This example teaches you how to create your own <k>search box</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
If you are in a hurry, simply download the Excel file.
This is what the spreadsheet looks like.
If you enter a search query into cell B2, Excel searches through column E and the results appear in column B.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/search-box/search-box.png">
To create this search box, execute the following steps.

1. Select cell D4 and insert the SEARCH function shown below.
Create an <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> to cell B2. 

2. Double click the lower right corner of cell D4 to quickly copy the function to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/search-box/search-function.png">
Explanation: the <a href="search.html">SEARCH function</a> finds the position of a substring in a string.
The SEARCH function is case-insensitive.
For Tunisia, string "uni" is found at position 2. For United States, string "uni" is found at position 1. The lower the number, the higher it should be ranked.
3. Both United States and United Kingdom return the value 1. To return unique values, which will help us when we use the RANK function in a moment, slightly adjust the formula in cell D4 as shown below.

4. Again, double click the lower right corner of cell D4 to quickly copy the formula to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/search-box/row-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="row-function.html">ROW function</a> returns the row number of a cell.
If we divide the row number by a large number and add it to the result of the SEARCH function, we always have unique values.
However, these small increments won't influence the search rankings.
United States has a value of 1.00006 now and United Kingdom has a value of 1.00009.  We also added the IFERROR function.
If a cell contains an error (when a string cannot be found), an empty string ("") is displayed.

5. Select cell C4 and insert the RANK function shown below.

6. Double click the lower right corner of cell C4 to quickly copy the formula to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/search-box/rank-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="rank.html">RANK function</a> returns the rank of a number in a list of numbers.
If the third argument is 1, Excel ranks the smallest number first, second smallest number second, etc.
Because we added the ROW function, all values in column D are unique.
As a result, the ranks in column C are unique too (no ties).

7. We are almost there.
We'll use the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> to return the countries found (lowest rank first, second lowest rank second, etc.) Select cell B4 and insert the VLOOKUP function shown below.

8. Double click the lower right corner of cell B4 to quickly copy the formula to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/search-box/vlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">

9. Change the text color of the numbers in column A to white and <a href="hide-columns-rows.html">hide</a> columns C and D.
Result.
Your own search box in Excel.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget/months.png">

3. Enter some data.

4. Enter the SUM function into cell B6. To achieve this, select cell B6, type an equal sign (=), enter SUM(, select the range B4:B5, close with a ")" and press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget/enter-some-data.png" loading="lazy">
Note: on the Home tab, in the Font group, you can add a top border.

5. Select cell B6, click the lower right corner of the cell and drag it across to cell M6. Excel copies the function and border to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget/copy-function.png" loading="lazy">

6. Enter the SUM function into cell O4. Remember, select cell O4, type =SUM(, select the range B4:M4, close with a ")" and press Enter.

7. Drag cell O4 down to cell O6. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget/year-column.png" loading="lazy">

8. Repeat steps 4 to 7 for the expenses.

9. Add a Short/Extra row.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget/budget-result.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: we created two <a href="../data-analysis/conditional-formatting.html">conditional formatting</a> rules to highlight cells lower than 0 and greater than 0. You can follow the link to learn more about this topic.
Maybe this is one step too far for you at this stage, but it shows you one of the many other powerful features Excel has to offer.
<h2>Calendar</h2>
This example describes how to create a <k>calendar</k> in <k>Excel</k> (2023 calendar, 2024 calendar, etc).
If you are in a hurry, simply download the Excel file.
Note: the instructions below do not teach you how to format the worksheet.
We assume that you know how to change font sizes, font styles, insert rows and columns, add borders, change background colors, etc.
This is what January 2025 looks like.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/calendar/excel-2025-calendar.png">
The big question is: how do we tell Excel that January 2025 starts on a Wednesday?

1. First, to make the formulas easier to understand, we created the following <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>.
<table class="gridtable" width="100%">
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Cells</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CalendarYear</td>
<td>K5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JanOffset</td>
<td>=DATE(CalendarYear,1,1)-WEEKDAY(DATE(CalendarYear,1,1))</td>
</tr>
</table>

Explanation: dates are stored as numbers in Excel and count the number of days since January 0, 1900. The DATE function returns the number that represents the date.
The DATE function accepts three arguments: year, month and day.
The WEEKDAY function returns a number from 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday) representing the day of the week of a date.
For example, January 1st, 2025 is the same as 45658. This date falls on a Wednesday.In other words, =DATE(CalendarYear,1,1) equals 45658 and WEEKDAY(DATE(CalendarYear,1,1)) equals 4. As a result, JanOffset equals 45658 - 4 = 45654. 

2. Let's take a look at the formula in cell B4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/calendar/calendar-formula-cell-b4.png">
Explanation: JanOffset+1 is nothing more than a date.
In fact, it is (4-1) days earlier than January 1st, 2025. This formula checks if the year of this date equals CalendarYear <u>and</u> the month equals January (1).
If true, it returns the date.
If not, it returns an empty string ("").

3. Let's take a look at the formula in cell E4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/calendar/calendar-formula-cell-e4.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: JanOffset+4 is nothing more than a date.
In fact, it is (4-4) days earlier than January 1st, 2025. This is the first day of the year! This formula checks if the year of this date equals CalendarYear <u>and</u> the month equals January (1).
This is true! Excel returns the date.

4. We changed the format to "day format" to only display the day of the month.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/calendar/day-format.png" loading="lazy">
Note: in a similar way, you can create the formulas for the other days in January and the other months.
This calendar tool lets you create a calendar for every year you want! Just use the Spin Button to increase the calendar year.
<h2>Holidays</h2>
This example teaches you how to get the date of a <k>holiday</k> for any year (2023, 2024, etc).
If you are in a hurry, simply download the <k>Excel</k> file.
Before you start: the <a href="../functions/lookup-reference-functions.html#choose">CHOOSE function</a> returns a value from a list of values, based on a position number.
For example, =CHOOSE(3,"Car","Train","Boat","Plane") returns Boat.The <a href="weekdays.html#weekday">WEEKDAY function</a> returns a number from 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday) representing the day of the week of a date.

1. This is what the spreadsheet looks like.
If you enter a year into cell C2, Excel returns all the holidays for that year.
Of course, New Year's Day, Independence Day, Veteran's Day and Christmas Day are easy.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/holidays/holidays.png">

2. All other holidays can be described in a similar way: the xth day in a month (except Memorial day which is slightly different).
Let's take a look at Thanksgiving Day.
If you understand Thanksgiving Day, you understand all holidays.
Thanksgiving is celebrated the 4th Thursday in November.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/holidays/thanksgiving-day-2025.png">
The calendar below helps you understand Thanksgiving Day 2025. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/holidays/calendar-november-2025.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: DATE(C2,11,1) reduces to 11/1/2025. WEEKDAY(DATE(C2,11,1)) reduces to 7 (Saturday).
Now the formula reduces to 11/1/2025 + 21 + CHOOSE(7,4,3,2,1,0,6,5) = 11/1/2025 + 21 + 5 = 11/27/2025. We needed the 5 extra days because it takes 5 days until the first Thursday in November.
From there, it takes another 21 days (3 weeks) until the 4rd Thursday in November.
It doesn't matter on which day November 1 falls, the CHOOSE function correctly adds the number of days until the first Thursday in November (notice the pattern in the list of values).
From there, it always takes another 21 days until the 4rd Thursday in November.
Therefore, this formula works for every year.

3. Let's take a look at Martin Luther King Jr.
Day.
This formula is almost the same.
Martin Luther King Jr.
Day is celebrated the 3rd Monday in January.
The first DATE function reduces to the first of January this time.
The base position (0) in the list of values for the CHOOSE function is located at the second spot now (we are looking for a Monday)
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/holidays/martin-luther-king-jr-day-2025.png" loading="lazy" alt="Martin Luther King Jr.
Day 2025" width="604" class="fullwidth" height="187" title="Martin Luther King Jr.
Day 2025">
The calendar below helps you understand Martin Luther King Jr.
Day 2025. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/holidays/calendar-january-2025.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: DATE(C2,1,1) reduces to 1/1/2025. WEEKDAY(DATE(C2,1,1)) reduces to 4 (Wednesday).
Now the formula reduces to 1/1/2025 + 14 + CHOOSE(4,1,0,6,5,4,3,2) = 1/1/2025 + 14 + 5 = 1/20/2025. We needed the 5 extra days because it takes 5 days until the first Monday in January.

<h2>Automated Invoice</h2>
This article describes how to <k>automate</k> the generation of <k>invoices</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
If you are in a hurry, simply download the Excel file.
This is what the spreadsheet looks like.
If you select a Client nr from the <a href="drop-down-list.html">drop-down list</a> in cell E6, Excel automatically fills in the client information.
If you select a Product nr from one of the drop-down lists in cells A13 through A31, Excel automatically fills in the product information.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/automated-invoice.png">
Below we'll explain how we automated the entry of the product information.
The same tricks have been used for the client information.

1. On the Products sheet, type the product information.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/product-information.png">

2. On the Invoice sheet, select cells A13 through A31. 

3. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/click-data-validation.png" loading="lazy">

4. In the Allow box, click List.

5. Click in the Source box and select the range A2:A5 on the Products sheet.

6. Manually change the 5 to 1048576 (or any other large number) to include more cells.
Now you can add as many new products as you want.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/validation-criteria.png" loading="lazy">

7. Click OK.

8. Select cell B13 and enter the formula shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/description-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: If cell A13 is empty, the formula returns an empty string.
If not, the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> looks for the Product nr (1001) in the leftmost column of the range $A:$C (columns A to C) on the Products sheet, and returns the value in the same row from the second column (col_index_num is set to 2).

9. Select cell C13 and enter the formula shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/price-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: This formula is almost the same as the previous formula.
This time it returns the value in the same row from the third column (col_index_num is set to 3).

10. Select cell E13 and enter the formula shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/automated-invoice/amount-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: If cell A13 is empty, the formula returns an empty string.
If not, it returns the product of Price and Quantity.

11. To copy the formulas to the other cells, select the range B13:E13 and drag it down to row 31. Use the <a href="format-painter.html">Format Painter</a> to restore the formatting.
<h2>Default Templates</h2>
<a href="#book.xltx">Book.xltx</a>  |  <a href="#sheet.xltx">Sheet.xltx</a>
Book.xltx and Sheet.xltx are two special <k>templates</k> you can create and add to the XLStart folder.
As a result, <k>Excel</k> uses Book.xltx as the basis for new workbooks and Sheet.xltx as the basis for new worksheets.
<h3>Book.xltx</h3>
To create Book.xltx, execute the following steps.

1. Create a workbook.
For example, change the row height of all rows on the first sheet to 30 pixels.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/default-templates/create-book.xltx.png">
Note: you can also add a header or footer, change the styles, add or delete sheets, etc.

2. On the File tab, click Save As.

3. Click Browse.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/default-templates/click-browse.png">

4. Enter Book as filename.

5. Select Excel Template (*.xltx) from the drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/default-templates/save-as-template.png" loading="lazy">
Excel automatically activates the Templates folder.
Be careful not to store the template here.
Instead, go to the XLStart folder.
It's usually located here:
C:\Users\&lt;username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART

6. Click Save.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/default-templates/xlstart-folder.png" loading="lazy">

7. Close and reopen Excel.
Excel creates a new workbook based on Book.xltx.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/default-templates/new-workbook.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to stop using Book.xltx, simply delete the file from the XLStart folder.
To edit Book.xltx, on the File tab, click Open and then click Browse, to open the template.
Edit the file and save the file to its original location.
<h3>Sheet.xltx</h3>
Repeat the previous steps, but now create a workbook with a single sheet and name it Sheet.xltx.
This template will be used as the basis for new worksheets inserted into existing workbooks.
<h2>Time Sheet</h2>
This example teaches you how to create a simple <k>timesheet</k> calculator in <k>Excel</k>.
Cells that contain formulas are colored light yellow.
If you are in a hurry, simply download the Excel file.

1. To automatically calculate the next 4 days and dates when you enter a start date, use the formulas below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-sheet/date-formulas.png">

2. Select the cells containing the times.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-sheet/select-time-cells.png">

3. Right click, click Format Cells, and select the right Time format.
Use the circled format for cell K12, K13 and K14. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-sheet/time-format.png" loading="lazy">

4. To automatically calculate the hours worked each day, the total hours and the overtime hours, use the formulas below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-sheet/time-formulas.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>BMI calculator</h2>
Create a <k>BMI calculator</k> in Excel and find out if you are a healthy weight.
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
If you're in a hurry, simply download the Excel file.
Below you can find a screenshot of the BMI calculator.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/bmi-calculator.png">
Note: the instructions below do not teach you how to format the worksheet.
We assume that you know how to change font sizes, font styles, insert rows and columns, add borders, change background colors, etc.
To create this BMI calculator, execute the following steps.

1. Create a <a href="drop-down-list.html">drop-down list</a> in cell C5. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/drop-down-list.png">

2. Insert an <a href="if.html">IF function</a> into cell D7, D9 and D10 to show the correct units.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/if-function.png" loading="lazy">

3. Select Metric from the drop-down list.
The IF function in cell D10 returns an empty string.
Create a conditional formatting rule that changes the format of cell C10 when you select Metric from the drop-down list (step 6, 7 and 8).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/metric-units.png" loading="lazy">

4. Create the BMI formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/bmi-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: C9*12+C10 calculates the height in inches and C9/100 calculates the height in meters.
Using standard units, BMI = 703*pounds/inches^2. Using metric units, BMI = kg/m^2. Excel uses a default order in which calculations occur.
If a part of the formula is in parentheses, that part will be calculated first.
Also remember, Excel performs exponentiation (^) before multiplication (*) and division (/).

5. Enter a weight of 250 pounds.
Excel calculates the <k>body mass index (BMI)</k> and automatically changes the background color of the range C13:E13. This feature is called <a href="../data-analysis/conditional-formatting.html">conditional formatting</a> (step 6, 7 and 8).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/calculate-body-mass-index.png" loading="lazy">

6. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/click-conditional-formatting.png" loading="lazy">

7. Click Manage Rules.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/click-manage-rules.png" loading="lazy">
The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager appears.

8. From the drop-down list, change Current Selection to This Worksheet, to view all conditional formatting rules in this worksheet.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/bmi-calculator/bmi-categories.png" loading="lazy">
Note: select a rule and click Edit Rule to take a closer look at each rule.
The first 4 rules correspond with the BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese).
The 5th rule changes the format of cell C10 when you select Metric from the drop-down list (step 3).
<h2>Reject Invalid Dates</h2>
<a href="#outside-date-range">Outside a Date Range</a>  |  <a href="#sundays-saturdays">Sundays and Saturdays</a>
This example teaches you how to use data validation to <k>reject invalid dates</k>.

1. Select the range A2:A4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/select-range.png">

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/click-data-validation.png">
<h3>Outside a Date Range</h3>

3. In the Allow list, click Date.

4. In the Data list, click between.

5. Enter the Start date and End date shown below and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/validation-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: all dates between 5/20/2016 and today's date + 5 days are allowed.
All dates outside this date range are rejected.

6. Enter the date 5/19/2016 into cell A2. 
Result.
Excel shows an error alert.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/dates-outside-date-range-rejected.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to enter an input message and error alert message, go to the Input Message and Error Alert tab.
<h3>Sundays and Saturdays</h3>

3. In the Allow list, click Custom.

4. In the Formula box, enter the formula shown below and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/data-validation-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the WEEKDAY function returns a number from 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday) representing the day of the week of a date.
If a date's weekday is not equal to 1 (Sunday) AND not equal to 7 (Saturday), the date is allowed (&lt;> means not equal to).
In other words, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are allowed.
Sundays and Saturdays are rejected.
Because we selected the range A2:A4 before we clicked on Data Validation, <k>Excel</k> automatically copies the formula to the other cells.

5. To check this, select cell A3 and click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/formula-check.png" loading="lazy">
As you can see, this cell also contains the correct formula.

6. Enter the date 8/27/2016 (Saturday) into cell A2. 
Result.
Excel shows an error alert.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reject-invalid-dates/sundays-saturdays-rejected.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to enter an input message and error alert message, go to the Input Message and Error Alert tab.
<h2>Budget Limit</h2>
This example teaches you how to use data validation to prevent users from exceeding a <k>budget limit</k>.

1. Select the range B2:B8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget-limit/budget-limit-example.png">
Note: cell B10 contains a SUM function that calculates the sum of the range B2:B8. 

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget-limit/click-data-validation.png">

3. In the Allow list, click Custom.

4. In the Formula box, enter the formula shown below and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget-limit/data-validation-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the sum of the range B2:B8 may not exceed the budget limit of $100. Therefore, we apply data validation to the range B2:B8 (not cell B10!) because this is where the values are entered.
Because we selected the range B2:B8 before we clicked on Data Validation, <k>Excel</k> automatically copies the formula to the other cells.
Notice how we created an <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> ($B$2:$B$8) to fix this reference.

5. To check this, select cell B3 and click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget-limit/formula-check.png" loading="lazy">
As you can see, this cell also contains the correct formula.

6. Enter the value 30 into cell B7. 
Result.
Excel shows an error alert.
You cannot exceed your budget limit of $100. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/budget-limit/budget-limit-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to enter an error alert message, go to the Error Alert tab.
<h2>Prevent Duplicate Entries</h2>
This example teaches you how to use data validation to <k>prevent</k> users from entering <k>duplicate values</k>.

1. Select the range A2:A20. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/prevent-duplicate-entries/prevent-duplicate-entries-example.png">

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/prevent-duplicate-entries/click-data-validation.png">

3. In the Allow list, click Custom.

4. In the Formula box, enter the formula shown below and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/prevent-duplicate-entries/data-validation-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: The <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a> takes two arguments.
=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$20,A2) counts the number of values in the range A2:A20 that are equal to the value in cell A2. This value may only occur once (=1) since we don't want duplicate entries.
Because we selected the range A2:A20 before we clicked on Data Validation, <k>Excel</k> automatically copies the formula to the other cells.
Notice how we created an <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> ($A$2:$A$20) to fix this reference.

5. To check this, select cell A3 and click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/prevent-duplicate-entries/formula-check.png" loading="lazy">
As you can see, this function counts the number of values in the range A2:A20 that are equal to the value in cell A3. Again, this value may only occur once (=1) since we don't want duplicate entries.

6. Enter a duplicate invoice number.
Result.
Excel shows an error alert.
You've already entered that invoice number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/prevent-duplicate-entries/prevent-duplicate-entries-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to enter an input message and error alert message, go to the Input Message and Error Alert tab.
<h2>Product Codes</h2>
This example teaches you how to use data validation to <k>prevent</k> users from entering <k>incorrect product codes</k>.

1. Select the range A2:A7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/product-codes/select-range.png">

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/product-codes/click-data-validation.png">

3. In the Allow list, click Custom.

4. In the Formula box, enter the formula shown below and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/product-codes/data-validation-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: this AND function has three arguments.
LEFT(A2)="C" forces the user to start with the letter C.
LEN(A2)=4 forces the user to enter a string with a length of 4 characters.
ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(A2,3))) forces the user to end with 3 numbers.
RIGHT(A2,3) extracts the 3 rightmost characters from the text string.
The VALUE function converts this text string to a number.
ISNUMBER checks whether this value is a number.
The AND Function returns TRUE if all conditions are true.
Because we selected the range A2:A7 before we clicked on Data Validation, <k>Excel</k> automatically copies the formula to the other cells.

5. To check this, select cell A3 and click Data Validation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/product-codes/formula-check.png" loading="lazy">
As you can see, this cell also contains the correct formula.

6. Enter an incorrect product code.
Result.
Excel shows an error alert.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/product-codes/incorrect-product-code.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to enter an input message and error alert message, go to the Input Message and Error Alert tab.
<h2>Drop-down List</h2>
<a href="#create-drop-down-list">Create a Drop-down List</a> | <a href="#allow-other-entries">Allow Other Entries</a> | <a href="#add-remove-items">Add/Remove Items</a> | <a href="#dynamic-drop-down-list">Dynamic Drop-down List</a> | <a href="#remove-drop-down-list">Remove a Drop-down List</a> | <a href="#dependent-drop-down-lists">Dependent Drop-down Lists</a> | <a href="#table-magic">Table Magic</a>
<k>Drop-down lists</k> in <k>Excel</k> are helpful if you want to be sure that users select an item from a list, instead of typing their own values.
<h3>Create a Drop-down List</h3>
To create a drop-down list in Excel, execute the following steps.

1. On the second sheet, type the items you want to appear in the drop-down list.

5. Click in the Source box and select the range A1:A3 on Sheet2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/validation-criteria.png" loading="lazy">

6. Click OK.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/drop-down-list.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to copy/paste a drop-down list, select the cell with the drop-down list and press CTRL + c, select another cell and press CTRL + v.

7. You can also type the items directly into the Source box, instead of using a range reference.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/simple-drop-down-list.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this makes your drop-down list case sensitive.
For example, if a user types yes, an error alert will be displayed.<h3>Allow Other Entries</h3>
You can also create a drop-down list in Excel that allows other entries.

1. First, if you type a value that is not in the list, Excel shows an error alert.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/error-alert.png" loading="lazy">
To allow other entries, execute the following steps.

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.

5. You can now enter a value that is not in the list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/manual-input.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Add/Remove Items</h3>
You can add or remove items from a drop-down list in Excel without opening the 'Data Validation' dialog box and changing the range reference.
This saves time.

1. To add an item to a drop-down list, go to the items and select an item.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/select-item.png" loading="lazy">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/offset-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="offset.html">OFFSET function</a> takes 5 arguments.
Reference: Sheet2!$A$1, rows to offset: 0, columns to offset: 0, height: COUNTA(Sheet2!$A:$A) and width: 1. COUNTA(Sheet2!$A:$A) counts the number of values in column A on Sheet2 that are not empty.
When you add an item to the list on Sheet2, COUNTA(Sheet2!$A:$A) increases.
As a result, the range returned by the OFFSET function expands and the drop-down list will be updated.

5. Click OK.

6. On the second sheet, simply add a new item to the end of the list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/add-new-item.png" loading="lazy">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/structured-reference.png" loading="lazy">

5. Use this structured reference to create a dynamic drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/table-indirect.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="indirect.html">INDIRECT function</a> in Excel converts a text string into a valid reference.

6. On the second sheet, simply add a new item to the end of the list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/add-item.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/dynamic-drop-down-list.png" loading="lazy">
Note: try it yourself.
Download the Excel file and create this drop-down list.

7. When using tables, use the UNIQUE function in Excel 365/2021 to extract unique list items.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/unique-list-items.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell F1, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

8. Use this spill range to create a magic drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/create-drop-down-list.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: always use the first cell (F1) and a hash character to refer to a spill range.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/drop-down-list/drop-down-list-with-unique-values.png" loading="lazy">
Note: when you add new records, the UNIQUE function automatically extracts new unique list items and Excel automatically updates the drop-down list.
<h2>Dependent Drop-down Lists</h2>
This example describes how to create <k>dependent drop-down lists</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
Here's what we are trying to achieve:
The user selects Pizza from a drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dependent-drop-down-lists/first-drop-down-list.png">
As a result, a second drop-down list contains the Pizza items.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dependent-drop-down-lists/second-drop-down-list.png">
To create these dependent drop-down lists, execute the following steps.

1. On the second sheet, create the following <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>.
<table class="gridtable" width="292">

The schema defines the structure of the XML file.
We have to do this outside Excel.

1. For example, open Notepad and add the following lines.
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

&lt;data-set xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

 &lt;record>

 &lt;LastName>Smith&lt;/LastName>

 &lt;Sales>16753&lt;/Sales>

  &lt;Country>UK&lt;/Country>

  &lt;Quarter>Qtr 3&lt;/Quarter>

 &lt;/record>

 &lt;record>

 &lt;LastName>Johnson&lt;/LastName>

 &lt;Sales>14808&lt;/Sales>

  &lt;Country>USA&lt;/Country>

  &lt;Quarter>Qtr 4&lt;/Quarter>

 &lt;/record>

&lt;/data-set>
Note: the tags refer to the column names, but you can give them any name you want! For example, instead of LastName use Name.

2. Save the file as <a href="files/schema.xml">schema.xml</a>.

3. Open <a href="../data-set.xlsx">data-set.xlsx</a>.

4. On the <a href="developer-tab.html">Developer tab</a>, in the XML group, click Source to open the XML Source task pane.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xml/open-xml-source-task-pane.png" loading="lazy">

6. Click Add.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xml/click-add.png" loading="lazy">

7. Select <a href="files/schema.xml">schema.xml</a> and click OK twice.

8. Now simply drag (map) the 4 elements from the tree onto the worksheet (row 1).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xml/drag-elements-onto-worksheet.png" loading="lazy">

9. On the Developer tab, in the XML group, click Export.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xml/export-xml-file.png" loading="lazy">

You won't see curly braces.
Visit our page about <a href="count-errors.html">Counting Errors</a> for detailed instructions on how to create this array formula.
<h3>And Criteria</h3>
Counting with And criteria in Excel is easy.
The COUNTIFS function (with the letter S at the end) in Excel counts cells based on two or more criteria.

1. For example, to count the number of rows that contain Google <u>and</u> Stanford, simply use the COUNTIFS function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/countifs-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Or Criteria</h3>
Counting with Or criteria in Excel can be tricky.

1. The COUNTIF functions below count the number of cells that contain Google or Facebook (one column).
No rocket science so far.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/simple-or-criteria.png" loading="lazy">

2. However, if you want to count the number of rows that contain Google <u>or</u> Stanford (two columns), you cannot simply use the COUNTIF function twice (see the picture below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/wrong-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: rows that contain Google and Stanford are counted twice, but they should only be counted once.

4 is the answer we are looking for.

3. The array formula below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/count-with-or-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
Note: finish an array formula by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.

<h3>More about Countif</h3>
The COUNTIF function is a great function.
Let's take a look at a few more cool examples.

1. The COUNTIF function below uses a <a href="named-range.html">named range</a>.
The named range Ages refers to the range A1:A6. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/countif-named-range.png" loading="lazy">             

2. The COUNTIF function below counts the number of cells that are less than the average of the ages (32.2).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/countif-average.png" loading="lazy">

3. To count cells between two numbers, use the COUNTIFS function (with the letter S at the end).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/count-cells-between-two-numbers.png" loading="lazy">

4. Use the COUNTIF function to count how many times each value occurs in the named range Ages.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/count-how-many-times-each-value-occurs.png" loading="lazy">
Note: cell B2 contains the formula =COUNTIF(Ages,A2), cell B3 =COUNTIF(Ages,A3), etc.

5. Add the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> to find the duplicates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/use-countif-to-find-duplicates.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: use COUNTIF and conditional formatting to <a href="find-duplicates.html">find and highlight duplicates</a> in Excel.
<h3>Count Magic</h3>
The COUNTIF function can't count how many times a specific word occurs <u>in</u> a cell or range of cells.
All we need is a little magic!

1. The formula below counts how many times the word "dog" occurs in cell A1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/count-how-many-times-specific-word-occurs-in-cell.png" loading="lazy">

2. The formula below counts how many times the word "dog" occurs in the range A1:A2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/countif/count-how-many-times-specific-word-occurs-in-range.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about <a href="count-words.html">counting words</a> to learn more about these formulas.
<h2>Count Blank/Nonblank Cells</h2>
This example shows you how to count <k>blank</k> and <k>nonblank</k> cells in <k>Excel</k>.

1. The COUNTBLANK function below counts the number of blank cells in the range A1:A7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-blank-nonblank-cells/countblank-function.png">

2. The COUNTA function below counts the number of nonblank cells in the range A1:A7. COUNTA stands for count all.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-blank-nonblank-cells/counta-function.png">

3. The COUNTIFS function below counts the number of blank cells in the range B1:B7 with one additional criteria (blue).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-blank-nonblank-cells/count-blank-cells-using-countifs.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the COUNTIFS function (with the letter S at the end) in Excel counts cells based on two or more criteria.
Use an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between) to find blank cells.

4. The COUNTIFS function below counts the number of nonblank cells in the range B1:B7 with one additional criteria (pink).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-blank-nonblank-cells/count-nonblank-cells-using-countifs.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Count Characters</h2>
Use the LEN function to <k>count characters in Excel</k>.
Use LEN and SUBSTITUTE to <k>count specific characters in Excel</k>.

1. The LEN function in Excel counts the number of characters in a cell.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-characters/count-characters-in-a-cell.png">
Explanation: the LEN function counts 2 numbers, 1 space and 6 letters.

2. Use SUM and LEN to count the number of characters in a range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-characters/sum-len-function.png">
Note: as you can imagine, this formula can get quite long.

3. The array formula below counts the number of characters in a range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-characters/count-characters-in-a-range-of-cells.png" loading="lazy">
Note: finish an <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formula</a> by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
The array constant {9;4;6;5} is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 24. 

4. Use LEN and SUBSTITUTE to count how many times a specific character (in this example, the character a) occurs in a cell.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-characters/count-specific-character-in-a-cell.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the SUBSTITUTE function replaces the character a (second argument) with an empty string (third argument).
LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,"a","")) equals 8 (the length of the string without the character a).
If we subtract this number from 9 (total number of characters in cell A1), we get the number of occurrences of the character a in cell A1. 

5. The array formula below counts how many times a specific character (in this example, the character a) occurs in a range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-characters/count-specific-character-in-a-range-of-cells.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the array constant {1;1;2;1} is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 5. The SUBSTITUTE function is case-sensitive.
The A in Alaska is not counted.

6. The array formula below counts both lower and upper case occurrences of a specific character (in this example, the character a).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-characters/case-insensitive-character-count.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: The LOWER function converts all letters to lowercase first.
<h2>Not Equal To</h2>
In <k>Excel</k>, &lt;> means <k>not equal to</k>.
The &lt;> operator in Excel checks if two values are not equal to each other.
Let's take a look at a few examples.

1. The formula in cell C1 below returns TRUE because the text value in cell A1 is not equal to the text value in cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/not-equal-to-operator.png">

2. The formula in cell C1 below returns FALSE because the value in cell A1 is equal to the value in cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/false.png">

3. The IF function below calculates the progress between a start and end value if the end value is not equal to an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between), else it displays an empty string (see row 5).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/if-not-equal-to-empty-string.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> for more information about this Excel function.

4. The COUNTIF function below counts the number of cells in the range A1:A5 that are not equal to "red".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/count-cells-not-equal-to-red.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a> for more information about this Excel function.

5. The COUNTIF function below produces the exact same result.
The &amp; operator joins the 'not equal to' operator and the text value in cell C1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/concatenate-not-equal-to-operator-and-cell-value.png" loading="lazy">

6. The COUNTIFS function below counts the number of cells in the range A1:A5 that are not equal to "red" and not equal to "blue".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/count-cells-not-equal-to-red-and-blue.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the COUNTIFS function in Excel counts cells based on two or more criteria.
This COUNTIFS function has 2 range/criteria pairs.

7. The AVERAGEIF function below calculates the average of the values in the range A1:A5 that are not equal to 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/average-cells-not-equal-to-zero.png" loading="lazy">
Note: in other words, the <a href="averageif.html">AVERAGEIF function</a> above calculates the average excluding zeros.
You can use the NOT function in Excel to change FALSE to TRUE or TRUE to FALSE.
To illustrate this function, consider the following example.

8. The OR function below returns TRUE if the value in cell A2 equals "USA" or "UK".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/or-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: to quickly copy this formula to the other cells, double-click the fill handle (see orange arrow).

9. The formula below returns TRUE if the value in cell A2 is not equal to "USA" or "UK".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/not-equal-to/not-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: by adding the NOT function, the logical value returned by the <a href="or.html">OR function</a> is reversed, so that a TRUE value becomes FALSE, and vice versa.

<h2>Running Total</h2>
<a href="#use-the-sum-function">Use the SUM function</a>  |  <a href="#use-a-simple-formula">Use a Simple Formula</a>  |  <a href="#use-the-quick-analysis-tool">Use the Quick Analysis Tool</a>
This page teaches you how to create a <k>running total</k> (cumulative sum) in <k>Excel</k>.
A running total changes each time new data is added to a list.
<h3>Use the SUM function</h3>
First, let's use the SUM function to create a running total in Excel.

1. For example, select cell B9 below and enter a simple SUM function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/sum-function.png">

2. Next, select cell C2 and enter the SUM function shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/running-total-formula.png">
Explanation: the first cell ($B$2) in the range reference is an <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a>.
We <u>fixed</u> the reference to cell B2 by adding a $ symbol in front of the column letter and row number.
The second cell (B2) in the range reference is a normal <a href="../functions/cell-references.html#relative-reference">relative reference</a>.

3. Select cell C2, click on the lower right corner of cell C2 and drag it down to cell C7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/create-running-total.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: when we drag the formula down, the absolute reference ($B$2) stays the same, while the relative reference (B2) changes to B3, B4, B5, etc.

4. For example, take a look at the formula in cell C3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/absolute-reference.png" loading="lazy">

5. For example, take a look at the formula in cell C4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/running-total-check.png" loading="lazy">

6. At step 2, add the IF function as shown below (and drag it down to cell C7) to only display a cumulative sum if data has been entered.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/cumulative-sum.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if cell B2 is not empty (&lt;> means not equal to), the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> in cell C2 displays a cumulative sum, else it displays an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between).

7. Enter the sales in April.

<h3>Use a Simple Formula</h3>
You can also use a simple formula to quickly calculate a running total in Excel.

1. Start with the first value.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/first-value.png" loading="lazy">

2. Add the new value to the previous running total (and copy this simple formula down).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/add-new-value-to-previous-running-total.png" loading="lazy">

3. Select cell C3 (not cell C2!), click on the lower right corner of cell C3 and drag it down to cell C7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/running-total/copy-running-total-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the simple formula =C2+B3 changes to =C3+B4, =C4+B5, etc.
Each time the new value is added to the previous running total.

4. You can check this.

The powerful <k>SUMIF function</k> in <k>Excel</k> sums cells based on one criteria.
This page contains many easy to follow SUMIF examples.
<h3>Numeric Criteria</h3>
Use the SUMIF function in Excel to sum cells based on numbers that meet specific criteria.

1. The SUMIF function below (two arguments) sums values in the range A1:A5 that are less than or equal to 10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumif-function-with-two-arguments.png">

2. The following SUMIF function gives the exact same result.
The &amp; operator joins the 'less than or equal to' symbol and the value in cell C1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumif-function-ampersand-operator.png">

3. The SUMIF function below (three arguments, last argument is the range to sum) sums values in the range B1:B5 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A5 contain the value 25. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumif-function-with-three-arguments.png" loading="lazy">

4. The following SUMIF function gives the exact same result (second argument refers to cell D1).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/second-argument-refers-to-cell-d1.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Text Criteria</h3>
Use the SUMIF function in Excel to sum cells based on text strings that meet specific criteria.
Always enclose text in double quotation marks.

1. The SUMIF function below sums values in the range B1:B5 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A5 contain exactly circle.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sum-if-equal-to-text-value.png" loading="lazy">

2. The SUMIF function below sums values in the range B1:B5 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A5 do <u>not</u> contain exactly triangle.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sum-if-not-equal-to-text-value.png" loading="lazy">

3. The SUMIF function below sums values in the range B1:B5 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A5 contain exactly circle + 1 character.
A question mark (?) matches exactly one character.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumif-function-with-question-mark.png" loading="lazy">

4. The SUMIF function below sums values in the range B1:B5 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A5 contain a series of zero or more characters + le.
An asterisk (*) matches a series of zero or more characters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumif-function-with-asterisk.png" loading="lazy">

5. The SUMIF functions below sum values in the range B1:B5 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A5 contain exactly triangle <u>or</u> circle8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/two-sumif-functions.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Date Criteria</h3>
Use the SUMIF function in Excel to sum cells based on dates that meet specific criteria.

1. The SUMIF function below sums the sales after January 20th, 2018. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sum-if-date-is-greater-than.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the DATE function in Excel accepts three arguments: year, month and day.

2. The SUMIF function below sums today's sales.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumif-function-today-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: today is August 3rd, 2018. 

3. The SUMIFS function (with the letter S at the end) below sums the sales between two dates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sum-if-date-is-between.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the SUMIFS function in Excel sums cells based on two or more criteria (first argument is the range to sum, followed by two or more range/criteria pairs).
Adjust the dates to sum the sales in a specific month, year, etc.
<h3>And Criteria</h3>
Summing with And criteria in Excel is easy.

1. For example, to sum the cells that meet the following criteria: Google <u>and</u> Stanford (two criteria ranges), simply use the SUMIFS function (with the letter S at the end).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sumifs-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: remember, when using the SUMIFS function, the first argument is the range to sum, followed by two or more range/criteria pairs.
<h3>Or Criteria</h3>
Summing with Or criteria in Excel can be tricky.

1. The formula below sums the cells that meet the following criteria: Google or Facebook (one criteria range).
No rocket science so far.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/2x-sumif-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. However, if you want to sum the cells that meet the following criteria: Google <u>or</u> Stanford (two criteria ranges), you cannot simply use the SUMIF function twice (see the picture below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/wrong-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: cells that meet the criteria Google and Stanford are added twice, but they should only be added once.

10 is the answer we are looking for.

3. The array formula below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumif/sum-with-or-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
Note: finish an array formula by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Visit our page about <a href="sum-with-or-criteria.html">Summing with Or Criteria</a> for instructions on how to create this array formula.
<h2>SUMPRODUCT</h2>
<a href="#basic-use">Basic Use</a>  |  <a href="#advanced-use">Advanced Use</a>
To calculate the sum of the products of corresponding numbers in one or more ranges, use <k>Excel's powerful SUMPRODUCT function</k>.
<h3>Basic Use</h3>

1. For example, the SUMPRODUCT function below calculates the total amount spent.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/sumproduct-function.png">
Explanation: the SUMPRODUCT function performs this calculation: (2 * 1000) + (4 * 250) + (4 * 100) + (2 * 50) = 3500. 

2. The ranges must have the same dimensions or Excel will display the #VALUE! error.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/ranges-of-unequal-size.png">

3. The SUMPRODUCT function treats any entries that are not numeric as if they were zeros.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/non-numeric-entries.png" loading="lazy">

4. If you supply a single range, the SUMPRODUCT function produces the exact same result as the SUM function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/one-range.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Advanced Use</h3>
The SUMPRODUCT function is an extremely versatile function and can produce the same result as many built-in functions in Excel and even array formulas!

1a.
For example, the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a> below counts the number of cells that contain exactly star.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/countif-function.png" loading="lazy">

1b.
The SUMPRODUCT function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/double-negative.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: --(A1:A7="star") reduces to the following array constant:
--{TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE}
The double negative -- coerces these Booleans to 1's and 0's (TRUE=1, FALSE=0).
Result:
{1;0;0;0;0;1;0}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUMPRODUCT function, giving a result of 2. 

2a.
The COUNTIF function below counts the number of cells that contain exactly star + 1 character.
A question mark (?) matches exactly one character.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/wildcard-character.png" loading="lazy">

2b.
The SUMPRODUCT function is not perfect! You <u>cannot</u> use <a href="wildcards.html">wildcard characters</a> (? and *) when you use the SUMPRODUCT function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/sumproduct-limitation.png" loading="lazy">

3a.
The array formula below counts the number of characters in a range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/count-characters.png" loading="lazy">
Note: finish an <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formula</a> by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.

3b.
The SUMPRODUCT function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/elegant-sumproduct-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the array constant {9;4;6;5} is used as an argument for the SUMPRODUCT function, giving a result of 24. The SUMPRODUCT function handles arrays natively so you don't have to finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.

4a.
The array formula below sums the sales in 2018. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/sum-by-year.png" loading="lazy">

4b.
The SUMPRODUCT function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sumproduct/multiplication-operator.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: (YEAR(A1:A5)=2018)*B1:B5 reduces to:
({2018;2017;2018;2017;2017}=2018)*{10;1;7;20;3} and this reduces to:
{TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE}*{10;1;7;20;3}
We don't need a double negative (see example 1b) because the multiplication operator * automatically coerces the Booleans to 1's and 0's (TRUE=1, FALSE=0).
Result:
{10;0;7;0;0}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUMPRODUCT function, giving a result of 17. 
<h2>IF</h2>
<a href="#simple-if-examples">Simple If Examples</a>  |  <a href="#and-or-criteria">And/Or Criteria</a>  |  <a href="#nested-if">Nested If</a>  |  <a href="#more-about-if">More about If</a>
The <k>IF function</k> is one of the most used functions in <k>Excel</k>.
This page contains many easy to follow IF examples.
<h3>Simple If Examples</h3>
The IF function checks whether a condition is met, and returns one value if true and another value if false.

1a.
For example, take a look at the IF function in cell B2 below.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/if-greater-than.png">
Explanation: if the price is greater than 500, the IF function returns High, else it returns Low.

1b.
The following IF function produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/if-less-than.png">
Note: you can use the following <a href="comparison-operators.html">comparison operators</a>: = (equal to), > (greater than), &lt; (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less than or equal to) and &lt;> (not equal to).

2. Always enclose text in double quotation marks.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/simple-if-function.png" loading="lazy">

3a.
The formula below calculates the progress between two points in time.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/calculate-progress.png" loading="lazy">  

3b.
You can use the IF function to display an empty string if the end value hasn't been entered yet (see row 5).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/display-empty-string.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if the end value is not empty (&lt;> means not equal to), the IF function calculates the progress between the start and end value, else it displays an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between).
<h3>And/Or Criteria</h3>
Use the IF function in combination with the AND function and the <a href="or.html">OR function</a> and become an Excel expert.

1. For example, take a look at the IF function in cell D2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/if-this-and-that.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the AND function returns TRUE if the first score is greater than or equal to 60 and the second score is greater than or equal to 90, else it returns FALSE.
If TRUE, the IF function returns Pass, if FALSE, the IF function returns Fail.

2. For example, take a look at the IF function in cell D2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/if-this-or-that.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the OR function returns TRUE if at least one score is greater than or equal to 60, else it returns FALSE.
If TRUE, the IF function returns Pass, if FALSE, the IF function returns Fail.

3. For example, take a look at the IF function in cell D2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/advanced-if-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the AND function above has two arguments separated by a comma (Table, Green or Blue).
The AND function returns TRUE if Product equals "Table" and Color equals "Green" or "Blue".
If TRUE, the IF function reduces the price by 50%, if FALSE, the IF function reduces the price by 10%.
<h3>Nested If</h3>
The IF function in Excel can be nested, when you have multiple conditions to meet.
The FALSE value is being replaced by another IF function to make a further test.

1. For example, take a look at the nested IF formula in cell C2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/nested-if-example.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if the score equals 1, the nested IF formula returns Bad, if the score equals 2, the nested IF formula returns Good, if the score equals 3, the nested IF formula returns Excellent, else it returns Not Valid.
If you have Excel 2016 or later, simply use the <a href="ifs.html">IFS function</a>.

2. For example, take a look at the nested IF formula in cell C2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/nested-if-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if the score is less than 60, the nested IF formula returns F, if the score is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70, the formula returns D, if the score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, the formula returns C, if the score is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, the formula returns B, else it returns A.
<h3>More about If</h3>
The IF function is a great function.
Let's take a look at a few more cool examples.

1. For example, use IF and AND to test if a value is between two numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/if-value-is-between-two-numbers.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the AND function returns TRUE if the person is older than 12 and younger than 20, else it returns FALSE.
If TRUE, the IF function returns Yes, if FALSE, the IF function returns No.

2. You can combine IF with AVERAGE, SUM and other Excel functions.
The sky is the limit!
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if/if-average-sum.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the AND function returns TRUE if the input value is greater than 100 and the average of the values in the <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Data1 is greater than 100, else it returns FALSE.
If TRUE, the IF function returns the sum of Data2, if FALSE, the IF function returns 0. 
Confused? You can always use the Evaluate Formula tool to step through your IF formula.
This Excel tool helps you understand a formula.

3. For example, select cell G3 above.

4. On the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing group, click Evaluate Formula.

<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
<a href="#equal-to">Equal to</a> | <a href="#greater-than">Greater than</a> | <a href="#less-than">Less than</a> | <a href="#greater-than-or-equal-to">Greater than or equal to</a> | <a href="#less-than-or-equal-to">Less than or equal to</a> | <a href="#not-equal-to">Not equal to</a>
Use comparison operators in <k>Excel</k> to check if two values are equal to each other, if one value is greater than another value, if one value is less than another value, etc.
<h3>Equal to</h3>
The equal to operator (=) returns TRUE if two values are <k>equal to</k> each other.

1. For example, take a look at the formula in cell C1 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/comparison-operators/equal-to-operator.png">
Explanation: the formula returns TRUE because the value in cell A1 is equal to the value in cell B1. Always start a formula with an equal sign (=).

2. The IF function below uses the equal to operator.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/comparison-operators/if-function.png">
Explanation: if the two values (numbers or text strings) are equal to each other, the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> returns Yes, else it returns No.
<h3>Greater than</h3>
The greater than operator (>) returns TRUE if the first value is <k>greater than</k> the second value.

1. For example, take a look at the formula in cell C1 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/comparison-operators/greater-than-operator.png" loading="lazy">

<h2>OR</h2>
The <k>OR function</k> in Excel returns TRUE if any of the conditions are true and returns FALSE if all conditions are false.
Combine the OR function with other functions and become an <k>Excel</k> expert.

1. For example, take a look at the OR function in cell D2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/or-function.png">
Explanation: the OR function returns TRUE if the first score is greater than 70 or the second score is equal to 100, else it returns FALSE.

2. Combine the <k>OR function</k> with the <a href="if.html">IF function</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/if-or-function.png">
Explanation: the OR function returns TRUE or FALSE (see previous example).
If TRUE, the IF function returns Pass, if FALSE, the IF function returns Fail.

3. For example, take a look at the OR function in cell E2 below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/multiple-conditions.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the OR function returns TRUE if at least one score is greater than or equal to 90, else it returns FALSE.
The OR function can test up to 255 conditions.
The only way for the OR function to return FALSE is if all the conditions are FALSE (row 6).

4. The array formula below uses the OR function to return TRUE if any cell in the range A1:E6 is greater than or equal to 90. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/array-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: finish an array formula by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
The value in cell D4 is greater than or equal to 90. As a result, the array formula returns TRUE.

5. Combine the OR function with the AND function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/and-or-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the AND Function returns TRUE if all conditions are true and returns FALSE if any of the conditions are false.
The AND function above has two arguments separated by a comma (Table, Green or Blue).
The AND function returns TRUE if Product equals "Table" and Color equals "Green" or "Blue".

6. Combine the OR function with the WEEKDAY function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/or-weekday-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the WEEKDAY function in Excel returns a number from 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday) representing the day of the week of a date.
As a result, the OR function returns TRUE if the date falls on a weekend.

7. Don't confuse the OR function with the XOR (Exclusive OR) function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/or/xor-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the XOR function returns TRUE if an odd number of conditions are true, and FALSE otherwise.
With two conditions (see example above) the XOR function returns TRUE if one condition is true (row 2) and returns FALSE if both conditions are false (row 3, 4 and 6) or both conditions are true! (row 5).

<h2>IFS</h2>
Use the <k>IFS function</k> in <k>Excel 2016</k> or later when you have multiple conditions to meet.
The IFS function returns a value corresponding to the first TRUE condition.
Note: if you don't have Excel 2016 or later, you can <a href="if.html#nested-if">nest the IF function</a>.

1a.
If the value in cell A1 equals 1, the IFS function returns Bad.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifs/first-ifs-function-value-1.png">

1b.
If the value in cell A1 equals 2, the IFS function returns Good.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifs/first-ifs-function-value-2.png">

1c.
If the value in cell A1 equals 3, the IFS function returns Excellent.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifs/first-ifs-function-value-3.png" loading="lazy">

1d.
If the value in cell A1 equals another value, the IFS function returns No Valid Score.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifs/first-ifs-function-else.png" loading="lazy">
Note: instead of TRUE, you can also use 1=1 or something else that is always TRUE.
Here's another example.

2a.
If the value in cell A1 is less than 60, the IFS function returns F.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifs/second-ifs-function-value-41.png" loading="lazy">

2b.
If the value in cell A1 is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70, the IFS function returns D.

<h2>Contains Specific Text</h2>
To check <k>if a cell contains specific text</k>, use ISNUMBER and SEARCH in <k>Excel</k>.
There's no CONTAINS function in Excel.

1. To find the position of a substring in a text string, use the <a href="search.html">SEARCH function</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/contains-specific-text/search-function.png">
Explanation: "duck" found at position 10, "donkey" found at position 1, cell A4 does not contain the word "horse" and "goat" found at position 12. 

2. Add the ISNUMBER function.
The ISNUMBER function returns TRUE if a cell contains a number, and FALSE if not.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/contains-specific-text/isnumber-function.png">
Explanation: cell A2 <k>contains</k> the word "duck", cell A3 contains the word "donkey", cell A4 does not contain the word "horse" and cell A5 contains the word "goat".

3. You can also check if a cell contains specific text, without displaying the substring.
Make sure to enclose the substring in double quotation marks.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/contains-specific-text/double-quotation-marks.png" loading="lazy">

4. To perform a case-sensitive search, replace the SEARCH function with the FIND function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/contains-specific-text/case-sensitive-search.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the formula in cell C3 returns FALSE now.
Cell A3 does not contain the word "donkey" but contains the word "Donkey".

5. Add the <a href="if.html">IF function</a>.
The formula below (case-insensitive) returns "Found" if a cell contains specific text, and "Not Found" if not.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/contains-specific-text/check-if-a-cell-contains-specific-text.png" loading="lazy">

6. You can also use IF and COUNTIF in Excel to check if a cell contains specific text.
However, the COUNTIF function is always case-insensitive.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/contains-specific-text/if-and-countif-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the formula in cell C2 reduces to =IF(COUNTIF(A2,"*duck*"),"Found","Not Found").
An asterisk (*) matches a series of zero or more characters.

<h2>SWITCH</h2>
<a href="#simple-switch">Simple SWITCH</a>  |  <a href="#advanced-switch">Advanced SWITCH</a>  |  <a href="#combine-switch-with-other-functions">Combine SWITCH with other Functions</a>  |  <a href="#switch-or-ifs?">SWITCH or IFS?</a>
The <k>SWITCH function in Excel</k> looks up a specified value in a list of values and returns the result corresponding to the first match found.
<h3>Simple SWITCH</h3>
Let's start simple.
The <k>SWITCH</k> function below looks up the value in cell B3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/switch/simple-switch-function.png">
Explanation: if the value is 1, the SWITCH function returns "Bad".
If the value is 2, the SWITCH function returns "Good".
If the value is 3, the SWITCH function returns "Excellent".
The last argument (a dash in this example) is always the default value (if there's no match).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/switch/default-value.png">
<h3>Advanced SWITCH</h3>
Let's kick it up a notch! The SWITCH function below reduces the price of green and blue tables by 50% (see orange arrows).
All other products are discounted by 10%.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/switch/advanced-switch-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the formula shown above uses the &amp; operator to <a href="concatenate.html">concatenate</a> (join) the string in cell B3 and cell C3. If the value is "TableGreen", the SWITCH function reduces the price by 50%.
If the value is "TableBlue", the SWITCH function also reduces the price by 50%.
The last argument (10% discount) is always the default value (if there's no match).
<h3>Combine SWITCH with other Functions</h3>
Let's combine the SWITCH function with other Excel functions.
For example, the SWITCH function below looks up the result of the RIGHT function.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/switch/switch-and-right.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the RIGHT function extracts the 2 rightmost characters from the string in cell B3. If UT, the SWITCH function returns "Utah".
If TX, the SWITCH function returns "Texas".
If OH, the SWITCH function returns Ohio.
The last argument (a question mark in this example) is always the default value (if there's no match).
<h3>SWITCH or IFS?</h3>
The IFS function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/switch/ifs-function.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: the SWITCH function is shorter and easier to read.
However, the SWITCH can only perform an exact match.
When using <a href="comparison-operators.html">comparison operators</a> like "=", use IFS instead of SWITCH.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/switch/use-ifs-instead-of-switch.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="ifs.html">IFS function</a> to learn more about this powerful Excel function.
IFS and SWITCH are only available in Excel 2016 and later versions.
If you don't have Excel 2016 or later, you can <a href="if.html#nested-if">nest the IF function</a>.

<h2>If Cell is Blank</h2>
<a href="#if-blank">If Blank</a>  |  <a href="#if-not-blank">If Not Blank</a>  |  <a href="#highlight-blank-cells">Highlight Blank Cells</a>
Use the IF function and an empty string in <k>Excel</k> to check <k>if a cell is blank</k>.
Use IF and <k>ISBLANK</k> to produce the exact same result.
<h3>If Blank</h3>
Remember, the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> in Excel checks whether a condition is met, and returns one value if true and another value if false.

1. The IF function below returns Yes if the input value is equal to an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between), else it returns No.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/check-if-a-cell-is-blank.png">
Note: if the input cell contains a space, it looks blank.
However, if this is the case, the input value is not equal to an empty string and the IF function above will return No.

2. Use IF and ISBLANK to produce the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/isblank-function.png">
Note: the ISBLANK function returns TRUE if a cell is empty and FALSE if not.
If the input cell contains a space or a formula that returns an empty string, it looks blank.
However, if this is the case, the input cell is not empty and the formula above will return No.
<h3>If Not Blank</h3>
In Excel, &lt;> means not equal to.

1. The IF function below multiplies the input value by 2 if the input value is not equal to an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between), else it returns an empty string.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/check-if-a-cell-is-not-blank.png" loading="lazy">

2. Use IF, NOT and ISBLANK to produce the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/not-isblank-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Highlight Blank Cells</h3>
You can use conditional formatting in Excel to highlight cells that are blank.

1. For example, select the range A1:H8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/select-cells.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/click-conditional-formatting.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click Highlight Cells Rules, More Rules.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/more-rules.png" loading="lazy">

4. Select Blanks from the drop-down list, select a formatting style and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/if-cell-is-blank/select-blanks.png" loading="lazy">
Result.

<h2>Absolute Value</h2>
The ABS function in <k>Excel</k> returns the <k>absolute value</k> of a number.
In other words: the ABS function removes the minus sign (-) from a negative number, making it positive.

1. For example, the ABS function in cell B1 below returns the absolute value of a negative number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/absolute-value.png">
The ABS function has no effect on 0 (zero) or positive numbers.

2. The absolute value of 0 is 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/abs-function.png">

3. The absolute value of a positive number is the same positive number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/positive-number.png" loading="lazy">
When do we need the ABS function in Excel?

4. For example, calculate the forecast error (difference between the actual and the forecast value) for each month.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/forecast-error.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if we look at the sum of these errors (zero), this forecast model seems perfect, but it's not!

5. Simply use the ABS function to calculate the absolute error for each month.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/absolute-error.png" loading="lazy">

6. If you don't want to display the forecast errors on the sheet, use SUMPRODUCT and ABS.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/sumproduct-abs.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="sumproduct.html">SUMPRODUCT function</a> to learn more about this function.
Let's take a look at one more cool example.

7. Use the ABS function to calculate the absolute value of each difference.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/absolute-value-of-each-difference.png" loading="lazy">

8. Add the IF function to test if the values are within tolerance.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/if-abs.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if the difference is less than or equal to 3, the IF function returns 1, else it returns 0. 

9. Add icons.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-value/icons.png" loading="lazy">

10. Change the tolerance.

<h2>Copy a Formula</h2>
<a href="#copy-101">Copy 101</a>  |  <a href="#fill-handle">Fill Handle</a>  |  <a href="#absolute-reference">Absolute Reference</a>  |  <a href="#move-formula">Move a Formula</a>  |  <a href="#exact-copy">Exact Copy</a>  |  <a href="#copy-magic">Copy Magic</a>
When you <k>copy a formula</k>, <k>Excel</k> automatically adjusts the cell references for each new cell the formula is copied to.
<h3>Copy 101</h3>
Simply use CTRL + c and CTRL + v to <k>copy and paste</k> a formula in Excel.

1. For example, to copy a formula, select cell A3 below and press CTRL + c.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/copy-formula.png">

2. To paste this formula, select cell B3 and press CTRL + v.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/paste-formula.png">

3. Click in the formula bar to clearly see that the formula references the values in column B.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/formula-bar.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Fill Handle</h3>
Use the fill handle in Excel to quickly copy a formula to other cells.

1. For example, select cell A3 below, click on the lower right corner of cell A3 (the fill handle) and drag it across to cell F3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/copy-formula-across.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/formula-copied-across.png" loading="lazy">
You can also use the fill handle to quickly copy a formula down a column.

2. For example, select cell C1 below, click on the lower right corner of cell C1 (the fill handle) and drag it down to cell C6. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/copy-formula-down.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/formula-copied-down.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: instead of dragging the fill handle down, simply select cell C1 and double click the fill handle.
If you have hundreds of rows of data, this can save time!
<h3>Absolute Reference</h3>
Create an absolute reference to fix the reference to a cell or range of cells.
When you copy a formula, an absolute reference never changes.

1. For example, fix the reference to cell E2 below by placing a $ symbol in front of the column letter and row number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/absolute-cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">

2. Select cell C2, click on the lower right corner of cell C2 and drag it down to cell C7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/copy-absolute-cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Check:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/copy-formula/fixed-cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the absolute reference ($E$2) stays the same, while the relative reference (B2) changes to B3, B4, B5, B6 and B7. Visit our page about <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> to learn more about this topic.
<h3>Move a Formula</h3>
To move a formula in Excel, simply use cut (CTRL + x) and paste (CTRL + v).

Conclusion: cell B6 and cell E6 contain the exact same formula, cell B7 and cell E7 contain the exact same formula, etc.
<h2>3D-reference</h2>
A <k>3D-reference</k> in <k>Excel</k> refers to the same cell or range on multiple worksheets.
First, we'll look at the alternative.

1. On the Company sheet, select cell B2 and type an equal sign =
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/3d-reference/alternative-step1.png">

2. Go to the North sheet, select cell B2 and type a +
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/3d-reference/alternative-step2.png">

3. Repeat step 2 for the Mid and South sheet.
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/3d-reference/formula.png" loading="lazy">

4. This is quite a lot of work.
Instead of doing this, use the following 3D-reference: North:South!B2 as the argument for the SUM function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/3d-reference/3d-reference.png" loading="lazy">

5. If you add worksheets between North and South, this worksheet is automatically included in the formula in cell B2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/3d-reference/add-worksheet.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Name Box</h2>
You can use the <k>name box in Excel</k> to select a cell, range or named range.
You can also use the name box to quickly create a named range (important).

1. We start simple.
The name box below displays the address of the active cell (B6).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/name-box/name-box-displays-active-cell.png">

2. You can use the name box to select a cell, range or named range.
For example, click in the name box and type E2:F8. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/name-box/use-name-box-to-select-range.png">

3. Press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/name-box/upper-left-cell-of-selected-range.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the name box only displays the upper-left cell of a selected range.

4. Use the <k>name box</k> to quickly <k>create a named range</k>.
For example, select the range A2:A9 below, click in the name box and type Scores.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/name-box/use-name-box-to-create-named-range.png" loading="lazy">

5. Press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/name-box/named-range.png" loading="lazy">

6. Now let's use this named range in a formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/name-box/named-range-in-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use the Name Manager to edit and delete named ranges.

This example illustrates how to use the <k>union</k> and <k>intersect</k> operators in <k>Excel</k> (borders below for illustration only).

1. The union operator (comma) adds two ranges.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/union-intersect/union-operator.png">
Explanation: the SUM function reduces to =SUM(C4:D8) + SUM(D7:E11), 20. 

2. The intersect operator (single space) returns the intersection of two ranges.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/union-intersect/intersect-operator.png">
Explanation: the SUM function reduces to =SUM(D7:D8), 2. 
Let's look at a few cool examples.

3. Excel automatically adds union operators (commas).
For example, type =SUM( and hold down CTRL to select the ranges below.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/union-intersect/multiple-union-operators.png" loading="lazy">
Note: press Enter to insert this function.
Excel adds the closing parenthesis for you.

4. You can use the intersect operator (space) to return the intersection of two named ranges.

<h2>Absolute Reference</h2>
<a href="#cell">Cell</a>  |  <a href="#range">Range</a>  |  <a href="#named-range">Named Range</a>  |  <a href="#f4">F4</a>
An <k>absolute reference in Excel</k> refers to a fixed location on a worksheet.
When you copy a formula, an absolute reference never changes.
<h3>Cell</h3>
Let's start with fixing a reference to a cell.

1. Cell C2 below refers to cell B2 and cell E2. Both references are relative.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/relative-cell-reference.png">

2. This is what happens when we <a href="copy-formula.html">copy the formula</a> in cell C2 to cell C3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/copy-relative-cell-reference.png">

3. Fix the reference to cell E2 by placing a $ symbol in front of the column letter and row number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/absolute-cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">

4. To quickly copy the formula in cell C2 to the other cells, select cell C2, click on the lower right corner of cell C2 and drag it down to cell C7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/copy-absolute-cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Check:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/fixed-cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <k>absolute reference</k> ($E$2) stays the same, while the relative reference (B2) changes to B3, B4, B5, B6 and B7. 
<h3>Range</h3>
Sometimes you need to fix a reference to a range.
For example, when using the <a href="rank.html">RANK function</a> to rank numbers in a data set.
1. Cell C2 below refers to cell B2 and the range B2:B7. Both references are relative.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/relative-range-reference.png" loading="lazy">

2. This is what happens when we <a href="copy-formula.html">copy the formula</a> in cell C2 to cell C3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/copy-relative-range-reference.png" loading="lazy">

3. Fix the reference to the range B2:B7 by placing $ symbols in front of the column letters and row numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/absolute-range-reference.png" loading="lazy">

4. To quickly copy the formula in cell C2 to the other cells, select cell C2, click on the lower right corner of cell C2 and drag it down to cell C7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/copy-absolute-range-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Check:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/fixed-range-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the absolute reference ($B$2:$B$7) stays the same, while the relative reference (B2) changes to B3, B4, B5, B6 and B7. 
<h3>Named Range</h3>
Instead of using absolute range references, create a named range.
This way you can make your formulas easier to understand.

1. Select the range B2:B7, type a name in the Name box and press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/create-named-range.png" loading="lazy">

2. Now you can use this named range in your formulas.
Select cell C2, enter the RANK function shown below and copy this formula to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/copy-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Check:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/named-range.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a> to learn more about this topic.
<h3>F4</h3>
Use the F4 key to quickly toggle between all 4 types of cell references.

1. For example, select cell C2 below, click in the formula bar and move the insertion point in or to the right of E2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/relative-reference.png" loading="lazy">

2. Press F4 to create an absolute reference.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/absolute-reference.png" loading="lazy">

3. Press F4 again to create a mixed reference where the column is relative and the row is absolute.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/absolute-row-reference.png" loading="lazy">

4. Press F4 again to create a mixed reference where the column is absolute and the row is relative.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/absolute-reference/absolute-column-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about <a href="../functions/cell-references.html">cell references</a> to learn more about mixed reference in Excel.
<h2>ADDRESS</h2>
The <k>ADDRESS function in Excel</k> creates a cell reference as text, based on a given row and column number.

1. The ADDRESS function below returns $E$8. The row number is 8 and the column number is 5. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/address/address-function.png">

2. The ADDRESS function below returns $G$3. The row number is 3 and the column number is 7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/address/absolute-reference.png">

3. The ADDRESS function returns a text value.
Use the INDIRECT function in Excel to convert this text value into a valid cell reference.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/address/indirect-address.png" loading="lazy">

4. By default, the ADDRESS function creates an absolute reference.
To create a relative reference, use 4 for the third argument.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/address/relative-reference.png" loading="lazy">

5. For example, use the ADDRESS function in Excel to find the <k>cell address</k> of the maximum value in a column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/address/cell-address-of-maximum-value.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about <a href="locate-maximum-value.html">locating the maximum value</a> in a column for detailed instructions on how to create this formula.

6. Simply use the INDEX function in Excel to return a specific value in a two-dimensional range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/address/index-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 92 found at the intersection of row 3 and column 2 in the range E4:F7. Use <a href="index-match.html">INDEX and MACTH</a> in Excel to perform advanced lookups.
<h2>DATEDIF</h2>
To calculate the number of days, months or years between two dates in <k>Excel</k>, use the <k>DATEDIF function</k>.
The DATEDIF function has three arguments.

1. Fill in "d" for the third argument to get the number of days between two dates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/datedif/days.png">
Note: =A2-A1 produces the exact same result!

2. Fill in "m" for the third argument to get the number of months between two dates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/datedif/months.png">

3. Fill in "y" for the third argument to get the number of years between two dates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/datedif/years.png" loading="lazy">

4. Fill in "yd" for the third argument to ignore years and get the number of days between two dates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/datedif/ignore-years-get-days.png" loading="lazy">

5. Fill in "md" for the third argument to ignore months and get the number of days between two dates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/datedif/ignore-months-get-days.png" loading="lazy">

<h2>Time Difference</h2>
<a href="#simple-formula">Simple Formula</a> | <a href="#time-difference-formula">Time Difference Formula</a> | <a href="#time-difference-in-hours-as-decimal-value">Time Difference in Hours as Decimal Value</a> | <a href="#time-sheet">Time Sheet</a>
Calculating the <k>difference between two times</k> in <k>Excel</k> can be tricky.
Times are handled internally as numbers between 0 and 1. 
<h3>Simple Formula</h3>
Let's start with a simple formula that calculates the difference between two times in the same day.

1. Simply subtract the start time from the end time.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-difference/calculate-difference-between-two-times.png">
Note: AM is used for times in the night and morning.
PM is used for times in the afternoon and evening.
Change the <a href="date-time-formats.html">Time format</a> to display a time with or without AM/PM.

2. Change the number format of the values in cell A2, B2 and C2 to General.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-difference/numbers-between-0-and-1.png">
Note: times are handled internally as numbers between 0 and 1. For example, 6:00 AM is represented as 0.25 (quarter through the day).
<h3>Time Difference Formula</h3>
The simple formula shown above doesn't work if the start time is before midnight and the end time is after midnight.

1. Times that are negative show as ######.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-difference/negative-time.png" loading="lazy">

2. To clearly see this, change the number format of the values in cell A2, B2 and C2 to General.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-difference/time-calculation.png" loading="lazy">

3. The <k>time difference formula</k> below always works.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-difference/time-difference-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if the end time is greater than or equal to the start time, simply subtract the start time from the end time.
If not, add 1 (full day) to the end time to represent a time on the next day and subtract the start time.
<h3>Time Difference in Hours as Decimal Value</h3>
To calculate the difference between two times in hours as a decimal value, multiply the previous formula by 24 and change the number format to General.

1. The formula below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/time-difference/time-difference-in-hours-as-decimal-value.png" loading="lazy">

Use a string of 0's and 1's (third argument) to specify which days are weekend days.

1. The NETWORKDAYS.INTL function below returns 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/weekdays/networkdays.intl.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the first 0 tells Excel that Monday is not a weekend day.
The second 0 tells Excel that Tuesday is not a weekend day, etc.
In this example, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are weekend days.
The calendar below helps you understand this formula.

Excel copies the formula to the other cells.
Use the formula =OR(WEEKDAY(A1)=1,WEEKDAY(A1)=7) to highlight weekend dates.
<h2>Days until Birthday</h2>
To calculate the number of <k>days until</k> your <k>birthday</k> in <k>Excel</k>, execute the following steps.

1. Enter the date of birth into cell B2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/days-until-birthday/date-of-birth.png">

2. Enter the TODAY function into cell C2 to return today's date.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/days-until-birthday/today.png">

3. The most difficult part in order to get the number of days until your birthday is to find your next birthday.
The formula below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/days-until-birthday/next-birthday.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: The DATE function accepts three arguments: year, month and day.
We used the <a href="datedif.html">DATEDIF function</a> to find the number of complete years ("y") between Date of Birth and Today.
In this example, DATEDIF(B2,C2,"y") equals 42. If 42 complete years have passed since your date of birth (in other words, you have already celebrated your 42nd birthday), your next birthday will be 42 + 1 = 43 years after your date of birth.

4. Next, we use the DATEDIF function to find the number of days ("d") between Today and Next Birthday.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/days-until-birthday/days-until-birthday.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: Sharon's birthday is in 32 days.
If you have a list of names and birthdates, you can use Excel to highlight upcoming birthdays.
This is pretty cool.

5. For example, the formula below calculates how many days are left until Emily's birthday.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/days-until-birthday/days-until-birthday-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this formula isn't new.
To create this formula, take the formula from step 4 and replace D2 with the formula from step 3. Next, replace C2 with $F$1. 

6. Double click the lower right corner of cell C2 to quickly copy the formula to the other cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/days-until-birthday/upcoming-birthdays.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the absolute reference ($F$1) stays the same, while the relative reference (B2) changes to B3, B4, etc.
Visit our page about <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> to learn more about this topic.

7. To highlight upcoming birthdays within a week (green) or within a day (red), you can use conditional formatting in Excel.

<h2>Quarter</h2>
An easy formula that returns the <k>quarter</k> for a given date.
There's no built-in function in <k>Excel</k> that can do this.

1. Enter the formula shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quarter/quarter-formula.png">
Explanation: ROUNDUP(x,0) always rounds x up to the nearest integer.
The MONTH function returns the month number of a date.
In this example, the formula reduces to =ROUNDUP(5/3,0), =ROUNDUP(1.666667,0), 2. May is in Quarter 2. 

2. Let's see if this <k>formula</k> works for all months.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quarter/months-to-quarters.png">
Explanation: now it's not difficult to see that the first three values (months) in column B are rounded up to 1 (Quarter 1), the next three values (months) in column B are rounded up to 2 (Quarter 2), etc.

3. You can also use MONTH and CHOOSE in Excel to return the quarter for a given date.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quarter/quarter-from-date.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: in this formula, MONTH(A1) returns 5. As a result, the CHOOSE function returns the fifth choice.
May is in Quarter 2. 

4. This formula works for all months.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quarter/quarters.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: in this formula, MONTH(A1) returns 1. As a result, the CHOOSE function returns the first choice.
January is in Quarter 1.

1. To get the year of a date, use the YEAR function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/day-of-the-year/year-function.png">

2. Use the DATE function below to return January 1, 2016. The DATE function accepts three arguments: year, month and day.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/day-of-the-year/date-function.png">

3. The formula below returns the day of the year.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/day-of-the-year/day-of-the-year.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: dates and times are stored as numbers in Excel and count the number of days since January 0, 1900. June 23, 2016 is the same as 42544. January 1, 2016 is the same as 42370. Subtracting these numbers and adding 1 gives the day of the year.

42544 - 42370 + 1 = 174 + 1 = 175. 

4. 2016 is a leap year.
A leap year has 366 days.
December 31st is the last day of the year.
We can check this.

<h2>Separate Strings</h2>
<a href="#formulas">Formulas</a>  |  <a href="#flash-fill">Flash Fill</a>  |  <a href="#textsplit">TextSplit</a>
To <k>separate strings in Excel</k>, use RIGHT, LEN, FIND and LEFT.
If you're not a formula hero, use Flash Fill to split text strings in Excel.
<h3>Formulas</h3>
The problem we are dealing with is that we need to tell Excel where we want to separate the string (see picture below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/separate-strings-example.png">
In case of Smith, Mike the comma is at position 6 while in case of Williams, Janet the comma is at position 9. 

1. To get the first name, use the formula below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/first-name.png">
Explanation: to find the position of the comma, use the FIND function (position 6).
To get the length of a string, use the LEN function (11 characters).
=RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2)-1) reduces to =RIGHT(A2,11-6-1).
=RIGHT(A2,4) extracts the 4 rightmost characters and gives the desired result (Mike).

2. To get the last name, use the following formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/last-name.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: to find the position of the comma, use the FIND function (position 6).
=LEFT(A2,FIND(",", A2)-1) reduces to =LEFT(A2,6-1).
=LEFT(A2,5) extracts the 5 leftmost characters and gives the desired result (Smith).

3. Select the range B2:C2 and drag it down.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/separate-strings-result.png" loading="lazy">
There's an even quicker way to achieve this result.
Read on.
<h3>Flash Fill</h3>
If you're not a formula hero, use Flash Fill to <k>split text strings in Excel</k>.

1. First, tell Excel what you want to do by entering the first name Mike into cell B2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/flash-fill-example-1.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Flash Fill (or press CTRL + E).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/click-flash-fill.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/flash-fill-result-1.png" loading="lazy">
That's pretty cool!

3. Next, enter the last name Smith into cell C2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/flash-fill-example-2.png" loading="lazy">

4. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Flash Fill (or press CTRL + E).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/click-flash-fill.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/flash-fill-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Note: one drawback when using Flash Fill is that the output will not automatically update when the source data changes.
Create formulas (see first paragraph) to overcome this limitation.
<h3>TextSplit</h3>
If you have Excel 365, use the new TEXTSPLIT function to split text into rows or columns using delimiters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/separate-strings/textsplit-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the TEXTSPLIT function, entered into cell B2, fills multiple cells (B2 and C2).
Wow! This behavior is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h2>Count Words</h2>
Use TRIM, LEN, SUBSTITUTE and SUMPRODUCT in <k>Excel</k> to <k>count words</k>.
First, let's count the total number of words in a cell or range of cells.

1. The TRIM function below returns a string with only regular spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/trim-function.png">

2. To get the length of this string, add the LEN function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/len-trim.png">

3. The SUBSTITUTE function below returns a string without spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/substitute-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. To get the length of this string, add the LEN function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/len-substitute.png" loading="lazy">

5. To count the total number of words in cell A1, subtract the length of the string without spaces (formula from step 4) from the length of the string with only regular spaces (formula from step 2) and add 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/count-total-number-of-words-in-cell.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: to <k>count the total number of words</k> in a cell, simply count the number of spaces and add 1 to this result.

1 space means 2 words, 2 spaces means 3 words, etc.

6. To count the total number of words in the range A1:A2, add the SUMPRODUCT function and replace A1 with A1:A2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/count-total-number-of-words-in-range.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="sumproduct.html">SUMPRODUCT function</a> to learn more about this Excel function.
Finally, let's <k>count how many times a specific word occurs</k> in a cell or range of cells.
This trick is pretty cool.

7. The LEN function below returns the length of the original text in cell A1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/length-original-text.png" loading="lazy">

8. The SUBSTITUTE function below returns the string without the word "dog".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/remove-substring.png" loading="lazy">

9. The LEN function below returns the length of this string.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/length-text-without-substring.png" loading="lazy">

10. Subtract the length of the string without the word "dog" (formula from step 9) from the length of the original text in cell A1 (formula from step 7).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-words/missing-characters.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: after removing the word "dog" from the original text, 12 characters are missing.

11. We know the length of the word "dog" (3), so the word "dog" occurs 12 / 3 = 4 times in cell A1.

<h2>Remove Spaces</h2>
The TRIM function in <k>Excel</k> removes leading <k>spaces</k>, extra spaces and trailing spaces.
Use the SUBSTITUTE function to <k>remove</k> all spaces or non-breaking spaces.

1. The TRIM function below removes 2 leading spaces, 3 extra spaces and 2 trailing spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/remove-spaces.png">
Note: the TRIM function does not remove single spaces between words.

2. To get the length of a string, use the LEN function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/len-function.png">
Explanation: the LEN function counts 2 spaces, 2 characters, 4 spaces, 3 characters and 2 spaces.

3. You can use the SUBSTITUTE function to remove all spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/remove-all-spaces.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the SUBSTITUTE function substitutes spaces (second argument) with empty strings (third argument).
Text imported from other applications may contain ASCII characters.
The CLEAN function removes the first 32 non-printable ASCII characters (codes 0 through 31).

4. The CLEAN function below removes a non-printable character, CHAR(7).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/clean-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. Simply combine CLEAN and TRIM to remove non-printable characters and spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/clean-trim-function.png" loading="lazy">

6. The CLEAN function removes line breaks.
To enter a line break, press ALT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/remove-line-breaks.png" loading="lazy">

7. You can also use the SUBSTITUTE function to remove a line break, CHAR(10), and replace it with something else.
For example, a comma and a space.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/substitute-line-breaks.png" loading="lazy">
The CLEAN function doesn't remove all ASCII characters.
Simply use the SUBSTITUTE function to remove other ASCII characters.

8. First, find out the code number of the character.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/code-number.png" loading="lazy">

9. Next, use SUBSTITUTE and CHAR to return the text string without this character.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/substitute-function.png" loading="lazy">

10. If your text contains non-breaking spaces, CHAR(160), the TRIM function doesn't work.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/non-breaking-spaces.png" loading="lazy">

11. You can use the SUBSTITUTE function to substitute non-breaking spaces, CHAR(160) with normal spaces, CHAR(32).
Don't forget to add a TRIM function to remove the extra spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/remove-spaces/remove-non-breaking-spaces.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Compare Text</h2>
This example shows two ways to <k>compare text strings</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
One is case-sensitive and one is case-insensitive.

1. Use the EXACT function (case-sensitive).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-text/case-sensitive-comparison.png">
Explanation: the string "Frog" in cell A1 and the string "frog" in cell B1 are not exactly equal to each other (first letter in uppercase and first letter in lowercase).

2. Use the formula =A1=B1 (case-insensitive).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-text/case-insensitive-comparison.png">
Explanation: this formula ignores lowercase and uppercase differences.
As a result, the first six formulas return TRUE.

3. Add the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> to replace TRUE and FALSE with a word or message.
The formula below uses the EXACT function (see step 1).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-text/if-exact.png" loading="lazy">

4. Do you want to compare two or more columns by highlighting the differences in each row? Visit our page about <a href="row-differences.html">Row Differences</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-text/row-by-row-comparison.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Substitute vs Replace</h2>
If you know the text to be replaced, use the <k>SUBSTITUTE function in Excel</k>.
If you know the position of the text to be replaced, use the <k>REPLACE function</k>.

1. The <k>SUBSTITUTE</k> function below replaces 2013 with 2016. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/substitute-function.png">

2. The 4th argument (optional) specifies which occurrence you want to replace.
The SUBSTITUTE function below only replaces the second occurrence.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/substitute-second-occurrence.png">

3. The SUBSTITUTE function below substitutes spaces with empty strings.
In other words, this formula removes all spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/remove-spaces.png" loading="lazy">

4. The <k>REPLACE</k> function below starts at position 4 and replaces 2 characters with -P.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/replace-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. The REPLACE function below starts at position 1 and replaces 3 characters with an empty string.
In other words, this formula removes the first 3 characters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/remove-first-3-characters.png" loading="lazy">
You can also use Excel's Find and Replace feature to quickly find specific text and replace it with other text.

6. For example, select the range A1:A10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/select-range.png" loading="lazy">

10. Click 'Replace All'.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/replace-all.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
Excel replaces all occurrences of TX with CA.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substitute-vs-replace/4-replacements.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>TEXT</h2>
When joining text and a number, use the <k>TEXT function</k> in <k>Excel</k> to format that number.
This page contains many easy to follow TEXT function examples.

1a.
For example, without using the TEXT function this would be the result.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/without-text-function.png">

1b.
With the TEXT function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/text-function.png">
Note: #,## is used to add comma's to large numbers.
Always enclose the format code (second argument) in double quotation marks.

2. Here's another example.
Apply a percentage format.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/percentage-format.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 0 to display the nearest integer value.
Use 0.0 for one decimal place.
Use 0.00 for two decimal places, etc.

3. And another example.
Format a date.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/date-format.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use less/more m's, d's and y's to change the appearance of the date.

4. For example, use the TEXT function to only display the day of the week.
This time we simply use the TEXT function without adding text.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/day-of-the-week.png" loading="lazy">

5. Use the TEXT function to display a number in scientific notation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/scientific-notation.png" loading="lazy">

6. Use the TEXT function to display a fraction and add the TRIM function to remove the leading space.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/fraction.png" loading="lazy">
Simply use the '<a href="../basics/format-cells.html">Format Cells</a>' dialog box to find the right format code.

7a.
For example, enter a time into cell A1 and select cell A1. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/select-cell.png" loading="lazy">

7b.
Right click, and then click Format Cells (or press CTRL + 1).

7c.
Select the Custom category and click a format code.
Next, click in the Type box, select the format code and press CTRL + c to copy this code.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/copy-format-code.png" loading="lazy">

7d.
Click Cancel.

7e.
Paste (CTRL + v) the format code into your <k>TEXT</k> function.
Don't forget to enclose the format code in double quotation marks.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/text/time-format.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>CONCATENATE</h2>
Use <k>CONCATENATE</k>, CONCAT, TEXTJOIN or the &amp; operator in <k>Excel</k> to concatenate (join) two or more text strings.

1. The CONCATENATE function below concatenates the string in cell A1 and the string in cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concatenate-function.png">

2. Use the &amp; operator to produce the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/&amp;-operator.png">

3. The CONCATENATE function below concatenates the string in cell A1, the string " and " (enclose text in double quotation marks) and the string in cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concatenate-function-with-three-arguments.png">

4. Use the &amp; operator to produce the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/join-strings.png" loading="lazy">

5. The CONCATENATE function below concatenates the string in cell A1, a space and the string in cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concatenation.png" loading="lazy">

6. Use the &amp; operator to produce the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/insert-space.png" loading="lazy">
The CONCAT function in Excel 2016 or later produces the exact same result as the <k>CONCATENATE function</k>.
Simply replace CONCATENATE with CONCAT in the formulas shown above.

7. The CONCAT function can also join a range of strings.
If you don't need a delimiter (space, comma, dash, etc.) this can be useful.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concat-function.png" loading="lazy">
The TEXTJOIN function in Excel 2016 or later joins a range of strings using a delimiter (first argument).

8. First, take a look at all the extra spaces in column E below when you drag the CONCATENATE function in cell E2 down to cell E11. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concatenate.png" loading="lazy">

9. The beauty of the TEXTJOIN function is that it can ignore empty cells (if the second argument is set to TRUE).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/textjoin-function.png" loading="lazy">

10. When using the CONCATENATE function, use the TEXT function to format numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concatenate-text.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 0 to display the nearest integer value.
Use 0.0 for one decimal place.
Use 0.00 for two decimal places, etc.
Visit our page about the <a href="text.html">TEXT function</a> for many more examples.

11. Use CHAR(10) to insert a line break.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/concatenation-with-line-breaks.png" loading="lazy">
Note: don't forget to enable text wrapping.
On the Home tab, in the Alignment group, click Wrap Text.

12. Let's take a look at one more cool example that uses the TEXTJOIN function.
First, the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> below finds all members of Team 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/if-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the IF function checks each cell in the <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Teams.
If equal to the value in cell E3, it returns the name from the named range Names, else it returns an empty string (two double quotes with nothing in between).

13. The IF function returns an array constant stored in Excel's memory.
Select the formula in the formula bar and press F9 to see this array constant.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/array-constant.png" loading="lazy">

14. Add the powerful TEXTJOIN function to concatenate these names.
Use a comma and space as the delimiter (first argument) and set the second argument to TRUE to ignore the empty strings.
Finish an <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formula</a> by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/concatenate/advanced-textjoin-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Mia, James and Sophia are in Team 1. Double click the lower right corner of cell F3 to quickly copy this formula to the other cells.
<h2>Substring</h2>
<a href="#mid">Mid</a> | <a href="#left">Left</a> | <a href="#right">Right</a> | <a href="#substring-between-parentheses">Substring between parentheses</a> | <a href="#substring-containing-specific-text">Substring containing specific text</a> | <a href="#flash-fill">Flash Fill</a> | <a href="#excel-365">Excel 365</a>
There's no <k>SUBSTRING</k> function in <k>Excel</k>.
Use MID, LEFT, RIGHT, FIND, LEN, SUBSTITUTE, REPT, TRIM and MAX in Excel to extract substrings.
<h3>Mid</h3>
To <k>extract a substring</k>, starting in the middle of a string, use the MID function in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/extract-substring.png">
Explanation: the MID function starts at position 7 (O) and extracts 6 characters.
<h3>Left</h3>
To extract the leftmost characters from a string, use the LEFT function in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/left-function.png">
To extract a substring (of any length) before the dash, add the FIND function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/leftmost-characters.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the FIND function finds the position of the dash.
Subtract 1 from this result to extract the correct number of leftmost characters.
The formula shown above reduces to LEFT(A1,4-1).
<h3>Right</h3>
To extract the rightmost characters from a string, use the RIGHT function in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/right-function.png" loading="lazy">
To extract a substring (of any length) after the dash, add LEN and FIND.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/rightmost-characters.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the LEN function returns the length of the string.
The FIND function finds the position of the dash.
Subtract these values to extract the correct number of rightmost characters.
The formula shown above reduces to RIGHT(A1,6-4).
<h3>Substring between parentheses</h3>
To extract a substring between parentheses (or braces, brackets, slashes, etc.), use MID and FIND in Excel.

1. The formula below is almost perfect.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/mid-find.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the FIND function finds the position of the opening parenthesis.
Add 1 to find the start position of the substring.
The formula shown above reduces to MID(A1,6+1,2).
This MID function always extracts 2 characters.

2. Replace the 2 (third argument) with a formula that returns the length of the substring.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/substring-between-parentheses.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: subtract the position of the opening parenthesis and the value 1 from the position of the closing parenthesis to find the correct length of the substring.
<h3>Substring containing specific text</h3>
To extract a substring containing specific text (for example, the @ symbol), use SUBSTITUTE, REPT, MID, FIND, TRIM and MAX in Excel.

1. First, use SUBSTITUTE and REPT to substitute a single space with 100 spaces (or any other large number).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/substitute-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. The MID function below starts 50 (1/2 * large number) positions before the position of the @ symbol and extracts 100 (large number) characters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/substring-with-spaces.png" loading="lazy">

3. Use the TRIM function to remove the leading and the trailing spaces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/trim-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. Put it all together.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/substring-containing-specific-text.png" loading="lazy">
Note: at step 2, the MID function starts 50 positions before the position of the @ symbol.
If the email address is the first word in the sentence (cell A3), this results in a negative start position.
In this case, the MAX function (see formula above) returns 1. 
<h3>Flash Fill</h3>
If you're not a formula hero, use <a href="flash-fill.html">Flash Fill</a> in Excel to automatically extract substrings.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/flash-fill.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel does not insert formulas, if you change the text strings in column A, Excel will not update the numbers in Column B.
<h3>Excel 365</h3>
If you have Excel 365, use TEXTBEFORE or TEXTAFTER to extract substrings in Excel.
These functions are simple and powerful.

1. We used the formula below to extract a substring (of any length) before the dash.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/leftmost-characters.png" loading="lazy">

2. The TEXTBEFORE function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/textbefore-function.png" loading="lazy">

3. We used the formula below to extract a substring (of any length) after the dash.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/rightmost-characters.png" loading="lazy">

4. The TEXTAFTER function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/textafter-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. We used the formula below to extract a substring between parentheses.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/substring-between-parentheses.png" loading="lazy">
Combine TEXTBEFORE and TEXTAFTER to produce the exact same result.

6. First, use the TEXTAFTER function to extract the substring after the opening parenthesis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/substring/substring-after-opening-parenthesis.png" loading="lazy">

7. Next, add the TEXTBEFORE function to extract the substring before the closing parenthesis.

<h2>VLOOKUP</h2>
<a href="#exact-match">Exact Match</a> | <a href="#approximate-match">Approximate Match</a> | <a href="#vlookup-looks-right">Vlookup Looks Right</a> | <a href="#first-match">First Match</a> | <a href="#partial-match">Partial Match</a> | <a href="#vlookup-is-case-insensitive">Vlookup is Case-insensitive</a> | <a href="#multiple-criteria">Multiple Criteria</a> | <a href="#na-error">#N/A error</a> | <a href="#multiple-lookup-tables">Multiple Lookup Tables</a> | <a href="#index-match">Index and Match</a> | <a href="#table-magic">Table Magic</a> | <a href="#xlookup">Xlookup</a>
The <k>VLOOKUP function</k> is one of the most popular functions in <k>Excel</k>.
This page contains many easy to follow VLOOKUP examples.
<h3>Exact Match</h3>
Most of the time you are looking for an exact match when you use the VLOOKUP function in Excel.
Let's take a look at the arguments of the VLOOKUP function.

1. The VLOOKUP function below looks up the value 53 (first argument) in the leftmost column of the red table (second argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/vlookup-arguments.png">

2. The value 4 (third argument) tells the VLOOKUP function to return the value in the same row from the fourth column of the red table.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/vlookup-result.png">
Note: the Boolean FALSE (fourth argument) tells the VLOOKUP function to return an exact match.
If the VLOOKUP function cannot find the value 53 in the first column, it will return a <a href="#na-error">#N/A error</a>.

3. Here's another example.
Instead of returning the salary, the VLOOKUP function below returns the last name (third argument is set to 3) of ID 79. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/exact-match.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Approximate Match</h3>
Let's take a look at an example of the VLOOKUP function in approximate match mode (fourth argument set to TRUE).

1. The VLOOKUP function below looks up the value 85 (first argument) in the leftmost column of the red table (second argument).
There's just one problem.
There's no value 85 in the first column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/vlookup-function-approximate-match-mode.png" loading="lazy"> 

2. Fortunately, the Boolean TRUE (fourth argument) tells the VLOOKUP function to return an approximate match.
If the VLOOKUP function cannot find the value 85 in the first column, it will return the largest value smaller than 85. In this example, this will be the value 80. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/largest-value-smaller-than-lookup-value.png" loading="lazy">

3. The value 2 (third argument) tells the VLOOKUP function to return the value in the same row from the second column of the red table.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/approximate-match.png" loading="lazy">
Note: always sort the leftmost column of the red table in ascending order if you use the VLOOKUP function in approximate match mode (fourth argument set to TRUE).
<h3>Vlookup Looks Right</h3>
The VLOOKUP function always looks up a value in the leftmost column of a table and returns the corresponding value from a column to the <u>right</u>.

1. For example, the VLOOKUP function below looks up the first name and returns the last name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/right-lookup.png" loading="lazy">

2. If you change the column index number (third argument) to 3, the VLOOKUP function looks up the first name and returns the salary.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/change-column-index-number.png" loading="lazy">
Note: in this example, the VLOOKUP function cannot lookup the first name and return the ID.
The VLOOKUP function only looks to the right.
No worries, you can use INDEX and MATCH in Excel to perform a <a href="left-lookup.html">left lookup</a>.
<h3>First Match</h3>
If the leftmost column of the table contains duplicates, the VLOOKUP function matches the first instance.
For example, take a look at the VLOOKUP function below.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/first-match.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the VLOOKUP function returns the salary of Mia Clark, not Mia Reed.
<h3>Partial Match</h3>
The VLOOKUP function supports <a href="wildcards.html">wildcards</a> for partial matches.
For example, take a look at the VLOOKUP function below.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/partial-match.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: an asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters.
The VLOOKUP function matches the first instance that begins with "Jess".
Use "*"&amp;G2 for an "ends with" match.
Use "*"&amp;G2&amp;"*" for a "contains" match.
<h3>Vlookup is Case-insensitive</h3>
The VLOOKUP function in Excel performs a case-insensitive lookup.
For example, the VLOOKUP function below looks up MIA (cell G2) in the leftmost column of the table.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/case-insensitive-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the VLOOKUP function is case-insensitive so it looks up MIA or Mia or mia or miA, etc.
As a result, the VLOOKUP function returns the salary of Mia Clark (first instance).
Use INDEX, MATCH and EXACT in Excel to perform a <a href="case-sensitive-lookup.html">case-sensitive lookup</a>.
<h3>Multiple Criteria</h3>
Do you want to look up a value based on multiple criteria? Use INDEX and MATCH in Excel to perform a <a href="two-column-lookup.html">two-column lookup</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/two-column-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the array formula above looks up the salary of James Clark, not James Smith, not James Anderson.
<h3>#N/A error</h3>
If the VLOOKUP function cannot find a match, it returns a #N/A error.

1. For example, the VLOOKUP function below cannot find the value 28 in the leftmost column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/na-error.png" loading="lazy">

2. If you like, you can use the IFNA function to replace the #N/A error with a friendly message.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/ifna-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the IFNA function was introduced in Excel 2013. If you're using Excel 2010 or Excel 2007, combine IF and ISNA or use IFERROR.
<h3>Multiple Lookup Tables</h3>
When using the VLOOKUP function in Excel, you can have multiple lookup tables.
You can use the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> to check whether a condition is met, and return one lookup table if TRUE and another lookup table if FALSE.

1. Create two <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>: Table1 and Table2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/first-table.png" loading="lazy">

2. Select cell E4 and enter the VLOOKUP function shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/vlookup-function-with-multiple-lookup-tables.png" loading="lazy"> 
Explanation: the bonus depends on the market (UK or USA) and the sales amount.
The second argument of the VLOOKUP function does the trick.
If UK, the VLOOKUP function uses Table1, if USA, the VLOOKUP function uses Table2. Set the fourth argument of the VLOOKUP function to TRUE to return an approximate match.

3. Press Enter.

4. Select cell E4, click on the lower right corner of cell E4 and drag it down to cell E10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/copy-vlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: for example, Walker receives a bonus of $1,500. Because we're using named ranges, we can easily copy this VLOOKUP function to the other cells without worrying about cell references.
<h3>Index and Match</h3>
Instead of using VLOOKUP, use <a href="index-match.html">INDEX and MATCH</a>.
To perform advanced lookups, you'll need INDEX and MATCH.
Maybe this is one step too far for you at this stage, but it shows you one of the many other powerful formulas Excel has to offer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/index-match.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Table Magic</h3>
Tables can make VLOOKUP formulas a lot easier.
In the example below, a single VLOOKUP function automatically looks up all country codes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/table-magic.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about <a href="merge-tables.html">merging tables</a> to learn how to create this VLOOKUP function and bring your Excel game to a new level.
<h3>Xlookup</h3>
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, use <a href="xlookup.html">XLOOKUP</a> instead of VLOOKUP.
The XLOOKUP function is easier to use and has some additional advantages.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/vlookup/xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Tax Rates</h2>
This example teaches you how to calculate the tax on an income using the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> in <k>Excel</k>.
The following <k>tax rates</k> apply to individuals who are residents of Australia.
<table class="gridtable">
<tr>
<th>Taxable income</th>
<th>Tax on this income</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0 - $18,200</td>
<td>Nil</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$18,201 - $37,000</td>
<td>19c for each $1 over $18,200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$37,001 - $87,000</td>
<td>$3,572 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $37,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$87,001 - $180,000</td>
<td>$19,822 plus 37c for each $1 over $87,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$180,001 and over</td>
<td>$54,232 plus 45c for each $1 over $180,000</td>
</tr>
</table>

Example: if income is 39000, tax equals  3572 + 0.325 * (39000 - 37000) = 3572 + 650 = $4222
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/tax-rates/tax-rates-example.png">
To automatically calculate the tax on an income, execute the following steps.

1. On the second sheet, create the <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Rates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/tax-rates/named-range.png">

2. When you set the fourth argument of the VLOOKUP function to TRUE, the VLOOKUP function returns an exact match or if not found, it returns the largest value smaller than lookup_value (A2).
That's exactly what we want!
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/tax-rates/vlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: Excel cannot find 39000 in the first column of Rates.
However, it can find 37000 (the largest value smaller than 39000).
As a result, it returns 3572 (col_index_num, the third argument, is set to 2).

3. Now, what's left is the remainder of the equation, + 0.325 * (39000 - 37000).
This is easy.
We can return 0.325 by setting col_index_num to 3 and return 37000 by setting col_index_num to 1. The complete formula below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/tax-rates/tax-rates-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: when you set the fourth argument of the VLOOKUP function to TRUE, the first column of the table must be sorted in ascending order.
<h2>INDEX and MATCH</h2>
<a href="#match">Match</a> | <a href="#index">Index</a> | <a href="#index-match">Index and Match</a> | <a href="#two-way-lookup">Two-way Lookup</a> | <a href="#case-sensitive-lookup">Case-sensitive Lookup</a> | <a href="#left-lookup">Left Lookup</a> | <a href="#two-column-lookup">Two-column Lookup</a> | <a href="#closest-match">Closest Match</a> | <a href="#xlookup">Xlookup</a>
Use <k>INDEX and MATCH</k> in <k>Excel</k> and impress your boss.
Instead of using <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP</a>, use INDEX and MATCH.
To perform advanced lookups, you'll need INDEX and MATCH.
<h3>Match</h3>
The MATCH function returns the position of a value in a given range.
For example, the MATCH function below looks up the value 53 in the range B3:B9. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/match-function.png">
Explanation: 53 (first argument) found at position 5 in the range B3:B9 (second argument).
In this example, we use MATCH to return an exact match so we set the third argument to 0. 
<h3>Index</h3>
The INDEX function below returns a specific value in a one-dimensional range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/index-function.png">
Explanation: the INDEX function returns the 5th value (second argument) in the range E3:E9 (first argument).
<h3>Index and Match</h3>
Replace the value 5 in the INDEX function (see previous example) with the MATCH function (see first example) to lookup the salary of ID 53. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/index-match.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the MATCH function returns position 5. The INDEX function needs position 5. It's a perfect combination.
If you like, you can also use the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a>.
It's up to you.
However, you'll need <k>INDEX and MATCH</k> to perform advanced lookups, as we will see next.
<h3>Two-way Lookup</h3>
The INDEX function can also return a specific value in a two-dimensional range.
For example, use INDEX and MATCH in Excel to perform a <a href="two-way-lookup.html">two-way-lookup</a>.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/two-way-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Case-sensitive Lookup</h3>
By default, the VLOOKUP function performs a case-insensitive lookup.
However, you can use INDEX, MATCH and EXACT in Excel to perform a <a href="case-sensitive-lookup.html">case-sensitive lookup</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/case-sensitive-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula correctly looks up the salary of MIA Reed, not Mia Clark.
<h3>Left Lookup</h3>
The VLOOKUP function only looks to the right.
No worries, you can use INDEX and MATCH in Excel to perform a <a href="left-lookup.html">left lookup</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/left-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Note: when we drag this formula down, the absolute references ($E$4:$E$7 and $G$4:$G$7) stay the same, while the relative reference (A2) changes to A3, A4, A5, etc.
<h3>Two-column Lookup</h3>
Do you want to look up a value based on multiple criteria? Use INDEX and MATCH in Excel to perform a <a href="two-column-lookup.html">two-column lookup</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/two-column-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the array formula above looks up the salary of James Clark, not James Smith, not James Anderson.
<h3>Closest Match</h3>
To find the <a href="closest-match.html">closest match</a> to a target value in a data column, use INDEX, MATCH, ABS and MIN in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/closest-match.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Xlookup</h3>
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, use <a href="xlookup.html">XLOOKUP</a> instead of INDEX and MATCH.
The XLOOKUP function is easier to use and has some additional advantages.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/index-match/xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Two-way Lookup</h2>
To <k>lookup</k> a value in a <k>two-dimensional range</k>, use INDEX and MATCH in <k>Excel</k>.
Below you can find the sales of different ice cream flavors in each month.

1. To find the position of Feb in the range A2:A13, use the MATCH function.
The result is 2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-way-lookup/match-function-month.png">

2. To find the position of Chocolate in the range B1:D1, use the MATCH function.
The result is 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-way-lookup/match-function-flavour.png">

3. Use these results and the INDEX function to find the sales of Chocolate in February.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-way-lookup/index-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 217 found at the intersection of row 2 and column 1 in the range B2:D13. 

4. Put it all together.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-way-lookup/two-way-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
You can also lookup a value in a two-dimensional range without using INDEX and MATCH.
The following trick is pretty awesome.

5. Select the range A1:D13. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-way-lookup/select-range.png" loading="lazy">

6. On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Create from Selection.

10. Create a dynamic two-way lookup.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-way-lookup/dynamic-two-way-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="indirect.html">INDIRECT</a> functions convert the text strings ("Feb" in cell G2 and "Chocolate" in cell G3) into valid named ranges.
<h2>OFFSET</h2>
<a href="#return-a-cell">Return a Cell</a>  |  <a href="#return-a-range">Return a Range</a>  |  <a href="#negative-offset">Negative Offset</a>
The <k>OFFSET function</k> in <k>Excel</k> returns a cell or range of cells that is a specified number of rows and columns from a cell or range of cells.
<h3>Return a Cell</h3>
First, let's use the OFFSET function in Excel to return a cell.
Here we go.

1. The OFFSET function below returns the cell that is 3 rows below and 2 columns to the right of cell A2. The OFFSET function returns a cell because the height and width are both set to 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/offset-cell-example.png">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/offset-cell-result.png">
The last 2 arguments of the OFFSET function are optional.
When height and width are omitted, the new reference has the same height and width as the starting reference (first argument).

2. For example, the OFFSET function below returns the cell that is 12 rows below and 0 columns to the right of cell A2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/height-width-omitted.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/simple-offset-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Return a Range</h3>
Alright.
Let's now use the OFFSET function in Excel to return a range (two or more cells).

1. The OFFSET function below returns the 1 x 2 range that is 8 rows below and 1 column to the right of cell A2. The SUM function calculates the sum of this range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/offset-range-example.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/offset-range-result.png" loading="lazy">
The last 2 arguments of the OFFSET function are optional (as previously mentioned).
When height and width are omitted, the new reference has the same height and width as the starting reference (first argument).

2. For example, the OFFSET function below returns the range that is 4 rows below and 0 columns to the right of the range B2:C2. The SUM function calculates the sum of this range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/range-as-starting-point.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/sum-offset-formula.png" loading="lazy">

3. The OFFSET function below returns the range that is 4 rows below and 0 columns to the right of the range B2:C2. This time without a SUM function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/offset-as-array-formula-example.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/offset-as-array-formula-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: before inserting this formula, select the range E8:F8 (or another range of the same size).
Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
The formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
To delete this array formula, select the range E8:F8 and press Delete.

4. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply select cell E8, enter the OFFSET function and press Enter.
Bye bye curly braces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/dynamic-array-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the OFFSET function, entered into cell E8, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h3>Negative Offset</h3>
If you want to return a cell or range of cells that is a specified number of rows above or columns to the left, use negative numbers.
The OFFSET function below returns the cell that is 12 rows above and 1 column to the left of cell C14. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/negative-offset-example.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/offset/negative-offset-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Case-sensitive Lookup</h2>
By default, the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> performs a case-insensitive lookup.
However, you can use INDEX, MATCH and EXACT in <k>Excel</k> to perform a <k>case-sensitive lookup</k>.

1. For example, the simple VLOOKUP function below returns the salary of Mia Clark.
However, we want to lookup the salary of MIA Reed (see cell G2).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/case-insensitive-lookup.png">

2. The EXACT function in Excel returns TRUE if two strings are exactly the same.
The EXACT function below returns FALSE.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/exact-function.png">

3. The EXACT function below returns TRUE.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/exact-match.png" loading="lazy">

4. Replace B8 with B3:B9. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/array-constant.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the EXACT function is stored in Excel's memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE}

5. All we need is a function that finds the position of TRUE in this array constant.
MATCH function to the rescue! Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/match-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: TRUE (first argument) found at position 6 in the array constant (second argument).
In this example, we use the MATCH function to return an exact match so we set the third argument to 0. The formula bar indicates that this is an <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formula</a> by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.

6. Use the INDEX function (two arguments) to return a specific value in a one-dimensional range.
In this example, the salary at position 6 (second argument) in the range D3:D9 (first argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/index-function.png" loading="lazy">

7. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/case-sensitive-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula correctly looks up the salary of MIA Reed, not Mia Clark.

8. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply use the XLOOKUP function to perform a case-sensitive lookup.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/case-sensitive-lookup/xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="xlookup.html">XLOOKUP function</a> to learn more about this great new Excel function.
<h2>Left Lookup</h2>
The <k><a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a></k> only looks to the right.
To look up a value in <k>any</k> column and return the corresponding value to the <u><k>left</k></u>, simply use <k>INDEX</k> and <k>MATCH</k>.

1. The MATCH function returns the position of a value in a given range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/left-lookup/match-function.png">
Explanation: 104 found at position 4 in the range $G$4:$G$7. 

2. Use this result and the INDEX function to return the 4th value in the range $E$4:$E$7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/left-lookup/index-function.png">

3. Drag the formula in cell B2 down to cell B11. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/left-lookup/drag-formula-down.png" loading="lazy">
Note: when we drag this formula down, the <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute references</a> ($E$4:$E$7 and $G$4:$G$7) stay the same, while the relative reference (A2) changes to A3, A4, A5, etc.

4. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply use the XLOOKUP function to perform a left lookup.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/left-lookup/xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the XLOOKUP function, entered into cell B2, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

<h2>Locate Maximum Value</h2>
To <k>find the maximum value in Excel</k>, use the MAX function.
To find the <k>cell address</k> of the maximum value in a column, use MAX, MATCH and ADDRESS.

1. First, we use the MAX function to find the maximum value in column A.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/locate-maximum-value/max-function.png">

2. Second, we use the MATCH function to find the row number of the maximum value.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/locate-maximum-value/match-function.png">
Explanation: the MATCH function reduces to =MATCH(12,A:A,0), 7. The MATCH function returns the position of the maximum value in column A.
Set the third argument to 0 to return an exact match.

3. Finally, we use the ADDRESS function to return the cell address.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/locate-maximum-value/address-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the ADDRESS function in Excel creates a cell reference as text, based on a given row and column number.
The ADDRESS function reduces to =ADDRESS(7,1), $A$7. 
<h2>INDIRECT</h2>
<a href="#cell-reference">Cell Reference</a>  |  <a href="#range-reference">Range Reference</a>  |  <a href="#named-range">Named Range</a>  |  <a href="#worksheet-reference">Worksheet Reference</a>
Use the <k>INDIRECT function</k> in <k>Excel</k> to convert a text string into a valid reference.
You can use the &amp; operator to create text strings.
<h3>Cell Reference</h3>
Use the INDIRECT function in Excel to convert a text string into a valid cell reference.

1. For example, take a look at the INDIRECT function below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/indirect-function.png">
Explanation: =INDIRECT(A1) reduces to =INDIRECT("D1").
The INDIRECT function converts the text string "D1" into a valid cell reference.
In other words, =INDIRECT("D1") reduces to =D1. 

2. The simple <k>INDIRECT</k> function below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/simple-indirect-function.png">

3. Do we really need the INDIRECT function? Yes.
Without using the INDIRECT function, this would be the result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/without-indirect-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. Use the &amp; operator to join the string "D" with the value in cell A1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/cell-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the formula above reduces to =INDIRECT("D1").
Again, =INDIRECT("D1") reduces to =D1. 
<h3>Range Reference</h3>
Use the INDIRECT function in Excel to convert a text string into a valid range reference.
For example, use SUM and INDIRECT.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/sum-indirect-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the formula above reduces to =SUM(INDIRECT("D3:D6")).
The INDIRECT function converts the text string "D3:D6" into a valid range reference.
In other words, =SUM(INDIRECT("D3:D6")) reduces to =SUM(D3:D6).
<h3>Named Range</h3>
Use the INDIRECT function in Excel to convert a text string into a valid named range.

1. For example, the AVERAGE function below uses the named range Scores.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/simple-named-range.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Scores refers to the range D1:D3. 

2. However, the AVERAGE function below returns an error.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/div-error.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: =AVERAGE("Scores") returns an error because Excel cannot calculate the average of a text string!

3. The INDIRECT function below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/average-indirect-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: =AVERAGE(INDIRECT("Scores")) reduces to =AVERAGE(Scores).
<h3>Worksheet Reference</h3>
Use the INDIRECT function in Excel to create a dynamic worksheet reference.

1. This is what a simple worksheet reference looks like.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/worksheet-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Note: cell A1 on Sheet1 contains the value 10. Cell A1 on Sheet2 contains the value 20. Cell A1 on Sheet3 contains the value 30. 

2. On the Summary sheet, enter the INDIRECT function shown below.
Use the &amp; operator to join the sheet name in cell A1 with "!A1".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/dynamic-worksheet-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the formula above reduces to =INDIRECT("Sheet1!A1").
The INDIRECT function converts the text string "Sheet1!A1" into a valid worksheet reference.
In other words, =INDIRECT("Sheet1!A1") reduces to =Sheet1!A1. 

3. If your sheet names contain spaces or other special characters, enclose the sheet name in single quotation marks.
Modify the INDIRECT function as shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/indirect/add-single-quotation-marks.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Two-column Lookup</h2>
This example teaches you how to perform a <k>two-column lookup</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
See the example below.
We want to look up the salary of James Clark, not James Smith, not James Anderson.

1. To join strings, use the &amp; operator.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-column-lookup/join-strings.png">

2. The MATCH function returns the position of a value in a given range.
Insert the MATCH function shown below.

3. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-column-lookup/match-function.png">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formula</a> by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
Explanation: the range (array constant) A2:A8&amp;B2:B8 is stored in Excel's memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{"JamesSmith";"JamesAnderson";"JamesClark";"JohnLewis";"JohnWalker";"MarkReed";"RichardLopez"}
This array constant is used as an argument for the MATCH function, giving a result of 3 (JamesClark found at position 3).

4. Use this result and the INDEX function to return the 3rd value in the range C2:C8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-column-lookup/index-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply use the XLOOKUP function to perform a two-column lookup.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/two-column-lookup/xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="xlookup.html">XLOOKUP function</a> to learn more about this great new Excel function.
<h2>Closest Match</h2>
To find the <k>closest match</k> to a target value in a data column, use INDEX, MATCH, ABS and MIN in <k>Excel</k>.
Use the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> in Excel to find an approximate match.

1. The ABS function in Excel returns the <a href="absolute-value.html">absolute value</a> of a number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/closest-match/abs-function.png">
Explanation: C3-F2 equals -39. The ABS function removes the minus sign (-) from a negative number, making it positive.
The ABS function has no effect on 0 (zero) or positive numbers.

2. To calculate the differences between the target value and the values in the data column, replace C3 with C3:C9. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/closest-match/array-constant.png">
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the ABS function is stored in Excel's memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{39;14;37;16;22;16;17}

3. To find the <k>closest match</k>, add the MIN function and finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/closest-match/min-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formula</a> by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
The array constant is used as an argument for the MIN function, giving a result of 14. 

4. All we need is a function that finds the position of the value 14 in the array constant.
MATCH function to the rescue! Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/closest-match/match-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 14 (first argument) found at position 2 in the array constant (second argument).
In this example, we use the MATCH function to return an exact match so we set the third argument to 0. 

5. Use the INDEX function (two arguments) to return a specific value in a one-dimensional range.
In this example, the name at position 2 (second argument) in the range B3:B9 (first argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/closest-match/index-function.png" loading="lazy">

6. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/closest-match/closest-match.png" loading="lazy">
Note: in Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
<h2>Compare Two Columns</h2>
<a href="#display-duplicates">Display Duplicates</a>  |  <a href="#unique-values-in-each-column">Unique Values in Each Column</a>  |  <a href="#row-by-row-comparison">Row by Row Comparison</a>
To compare two columns, use IF, ISERROR and MATCH in Excel.
You can display the duplicates or the unique values.
Before we start: do you want to compare two columns by highlighting the unique values in each column? Visit our page about <a href="compare-two-lists.html">comparing two lists</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/highlight-unique-values-in-each-column.png">
<h3>Display Duplicates</h3>
Let's start by comparing two columns and displaying the duplicates.

1. Display the duplicates in the first column (these values also occur in the second column).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/compare-two-columns.png">
Explanation: the MATCH function in cell C1 returns the number 5 (letter A found at position 5 in the range B1:B7).
As a result, the ISERROR function returns FALSE and the IF function returns the value in cell A1. The MATCH function in cell C4 returns a #N/A error (no letter D in the range B1:B7).
As a result, the ISERROR function returns TRUE and the IF function returns an empty string.

2. You can also display the duplicates in the second column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/duplicates-in-second-column.png" loading="lazy">
Note: at step 1, we matched each value in the first column with the range in the second column.
At step 2, we match each value in the second column with the range in the first column.
<h3>Unique Values in Each Column</h3>
Do you want to compare two columns by displaying the unique values in each column? Simply swap the last 2 arguments of the IF function.

1. Display the unique values in the first column (these values do not occur in the second column).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/unique-values-in-first-column.png" loading="lazy">
Note: take a look at the second picture on this page to see that we swapped the last 2 arguments of the IF function.

2. You can also display the unique values in the second column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/unique-values-in-second-column.png" loading="lazy">
Note: take a look at the third picture on this page to see that we swapped the last 2 arguments of the IF function.
<h3>Row by Row Comparison</h3>
For a quick row by row comparison, simply use the IF function in Excel.
1. The IF function in cell C1 below returns Match because the value in cell A1 is equal to the value in cell B1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/row-by-row-comparison.png" loading="lazy">

2. To perform a case-sensitive comparison, add the EXACT function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/case-sensitive-comparison.png" loading="lazy">

3. Do you want to compare two columns by highlighting the differences in each row? Visit our page about <a href="row-differences.html">Row Differences</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-columns/highlight-row-differences.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>XLOOKUP</h2>
<a href="#exact-match">Exact Match</a>  |  <a href="#not-found">Not Found</a>  |  <a href="#approximate-match">Approximate Match</a>  |  <a href="#left-lookup">Left Lookup</a>  |  <a href="#multiple-values">Multiple Values</a>  |  <a href="#horizontal-lookup">Horizontal Lookup</a>  |  <a href="#last-match">Last Match</a>
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, use XLOOKUP instead of <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP</a>.
The <k>XLOOKUP function</k> is easier to use and has some additional advantages.
<h3>Exact Match</h3>
By default, the XLOOKUP function in <k>Excel 365/2021</k> performs an exact match.

1. The XLOOKUP function below looks up the value 53 (first argument) in the range B3:B9 (second argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/xlookup-arguments.png">

2. Next, it simply returns the value in the same row from the range E3:E9 (third argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/xlookup-function.png">

3. Here's another example.
Instead of returning the salary, the XLOOKUP function below returns the last name (replace E3:E9 with D3:D9) of ID 79. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/exact-match.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Not Found</h3>
If the XLOOKUP function cannot find a match, it returns a #N/A error.

1. For example, the XLOOKUP function below cannot find the value 28 in the range B3:B9. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/na-error.png" loading="lazy">

2. Use the fourth argument of the XLOOKUP function to replace the #N/A error with a friendly message.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/not-found.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Approximate Match</h3>
Let's take a look at an example of the XLOOKUP function in approximate match mode.

1. The XLOOKUP function below looks up the value 85 (first argument) in the range B3:B7 (second argument).
There's just one problem.
There's no value 85 in this range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/xlookup-function-approximate-match-mode.png" loading="lazy"> 

2. Fortunately, the value -1 (fifth argument) tells the XLOOKUP function to find the next smaller value.
In this example, the value 80. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/next-smaller-value.png" loading="lazy">

3. Next, it simply returns the value in the same row from the range C3:C7 (third argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/approximate-match.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 1 instead of -1 for the fifth argument to find the next larger value.
In this example, the value 90. The XLOOKUP function also works with unsorted data.
In this example, there's no need to sort the scores in ascending order.
<h3>Left Lookup</h3>
Instead of using INDEX and MATCH in Excel to perform a <a href="left-lookup.html">left lookup</a>, simply use the XLOOKUP function.
For example, take a look at the XLOOKUP function below.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/left-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the XLOOKUP function looks up the last name and returns the ID.
<h3>Multiple Values</h3>
The XLOOKUP function in Excel 365/2021 can return multiple values.

1. First, the XLOOKUP function below looks up the ID and returns the first name (nothing new).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/basic-xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. Replace C6:C12 with C6:E12 to return the first name, last name and salary.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/xlookup-can-return-multiple-values.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the <k>XLOOKUP</k> function, entered into cell C3, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h3>Horizontal Lookup</h3>
Instead of using the <a href="../functions/lookup-reference-functions.html#hlookup">HLOOKUP function</a> in Excel to perform a horizontal lookup, simply use the XLOOKUP function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/horizontal-lookup.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the <k>XLOOKUP</k> function, entered into cell B2, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h3>Last Match</h3>
By default, the XLOOKUP function performs a first to last search (nothing new).
To perform a last to first search, set the sixth argument to -1 (see example below).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/xlookup/last-match.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: this XLOOKUP function returns the salary of Mia Reed, not Mia Clark.
<h2>PMT</h2>
<a href="#pmt-examples">PMT examples</a>  |  <a href="#ppmt-ipmt">PPMT and IPMT</a>
The <k>PMT function in Excel</k> calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.
This page contains many easy to follow <k>PMT examples</k>.
<h3>PMT examples</h3>
Consider a loan with an annual interest rate of 6%, a 20-year duration, a present value of $150,000 (amount borrowed) and a future value of 0 (that's what you hope to achieve when you pay off a loan).

1. The PMT function below calculates the annual payment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/annual-payment.png">
Note: if the fifth argument is omitted, it is assumed that payments are due at the end of the period.
We pay off a loan of $150,000 (positive, we received that amount) and we make annual payments of $13,077.68 (negative, we pay).

2. The PMT function below calculates the quarterly payment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/quarterly-payment.png">
Note: we make quarterly payments, so we use 6%/4 = 1.5% for Rate and 20*4 = 80 for Nper (total number of periods).

3. The PMT function below calculates the monthly payment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/monthly-payment.png" loading="lazy">
Note: we make monthly payments, so we use 6%/12 = 0.5% for Rate and 20*12 = 240 for Nper (total number of periods).
Consider an <a href="investment-annuity.html#investment">investment</a> with an annual interest rate of 8% and a present value of 0. How much money should you deposit at the end of each year to have $1,448.66 in the account in 10 years?

4. The PMT function below calculates the annual deposit.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/annual-deposit.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: in 10 years time, you pay 10 * $100 (negative) = $1000, and you'll receive $1,448.66 (positive) after 10 years.
The higher the interest, the faster your money grows.
Consider an <a href="investment-annuity.html#annuity">annuity</a> with an annual interest rate of 6% and a present value of $83,748.46 (purchase value).
How much money can you withdraw at the end of each month for the next 20 years?

5. The PMT function below calculates the monthly withdrawal.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/monthly-withdrawal.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: you need a one-time payment of $83,748.46 (negative) to pay this annuity.
You'll receive 240 * $600 (positive) = $144,000 in the future.
This is another example that money grows over time.
<h3>PPMT and IPMT</h3>
Consider a loan with an annual interest rate of 5%, a 2-year duration and a present value (amount borrowed) of $20,000. 

1. The PMT function below calculates the monthly payment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/pmt-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: we make monthly payments, so we use 5%/12 for Rate and 2*12 for Nper (total number of periods).

2. The PPMT function in Excel calculates the principal part of the payment.
The second argument specifies the payment number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/ppmt-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the PPMT function above calculates the principal part of the 5th payment.

3. The IPMT function in Excel calculates the interest part of the payment.
The second argument specifies the payment number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/ipmt-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the IPMT function above calculates the interest part of the 5th payment.

4. It takes 24 months to pay off this loan.
Create a <a href="loan-amortization-schedule.html">loan amortization schedule</a> (see picture below) to clearly see how the principal part increases and the interest part decreases with each payment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/pmt/loan-amortization-schedule.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the principal part and the interest part always add up to the payment amount.
<h2>Loans with Different Durations</h2>
This example teaches you how to compare <k>loans with different durations</k> in <k>Excel</k>.

1. First, we calculate the monthly payment on a loan with an annual interest rate of 6%, a 20-year duration and a present value (amount borrowed) of $150,000. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loans-with-different-durations/monthly-payment.png">
Note: we make monthly payments, so we use 6%/12 = 0.5% for Rate and 20*12 = 240 for Nper (total number of periods).

2. Next, select the range A2:D2 and drag it down two rows.

3. Change the duration of the other two loans to 25 and 30 years.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loans-with-different-durations/loans-with-different-durations-example.png">
The monthly payment over 30 years ($899,33) looks good in contrast to the $966,45 and $1,074.65. Right?

4. But now we calculate the Total Paid for each loan.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loans-with-different-durations/loans-with-different-durations-result.png" loading="lazy">
The monthly payment over 30 years ($899,33) suddenly does not look so attractive anymore.
Conclusion: the longer the duration of the loan, the more interest you pay.
<h2>Investment or Annuity</h2>
<a href="#investment">Investment</a>  |  <a href="#annuity">Annuity</a>
This example teaches you how to calculate the <k>future value</k> of an <k>investment</k> or the <k>present value</k> of an <k>annuity</k>.
Tip: when working with financial functions in Excel, always ask yourself the question, am I making a payment (negative) or am I receiving money (positive)?
<h3>Investment</h3>
Assume that at the end of every year, you deposit $100 into a savings account.
At an annual interest rate of 8%, how much will your investment be worth after 10 years?

1. Insert the FV (Future Value) function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/investment-annuity/insert-fv-function.png">

2. Enter the arguments.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/investment-annuity/future-value-investment.png">
In 10 years time, you pay 10 * $100 (negative) = $1000, and you'll receive $1,448.66 (positive) after 10 years.
The higher the interest, the faster your money grows.
Note: the last two arguments are optional.
If omitted, Pv = 0 (no present value).
If Type is omitted, it is assumed that payments are due at the end of the period.
<h3>Annuity</h3>
Assume you want to purchase an annuity that will pay $600 a month, for the next 20 years.
At an annual interest rate of 6%, how much does the annuity cost?

1. Insert the PV (Present Value) function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/investment-annuity/insert-pv-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. Enter the arguments.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/investment-annuity/present-value-annuity.png" loading="lazy">
You need a one-time payment of $83,748.46 (negative) to pay this annuity.
You'll receive 240 * $600 (positive) = $144,000 in the future.
This is another example that money grows over time.
Note: we receive monthly payments, so we use 6%/12 = 0.5% for Rate and 20*12 = 240 for Nper.
The last two arguments are optional.
If omitted, Fv = 0 (no future value).
If Type is omitted, it is assumed that payments are due at the end of the period.
This annuity does not take into account life expectancy, inflation etc.
<h2>Compound Interest</h2>
What's <k>compound interest</k> and what's the formula for compound interest in <k>Excel</k>? This example gives you the answers to these questions.

1. Assume you put $100 into a bank.
How much will your investment be worth after 1 year at an annual interest rate of 8%? The answer is $108. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/compound-interest-example.png">

2. Now this interest ($8) will also earn interest (compound interest) next year.
How much will your investment be worth after 2 years at an annual interest rate of 8%? The answer is $116.64. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/investment-after-2-years.png">

3. How much will your investment be worth after 5 years? Simply drag the formula down to cell A6. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/investment-after-5-years.png" loading="lazy">
The answer is $146.93. 

4. All we did was multiplying 100 by 1.08, 5 times.
So we can also directly calculate the value of the investment after 5 years.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/compound-interest-result.png" loading="lazy">
which is the same as:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/compound-interest-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: there is no special function for compound interest in Excel.
However, you can easily create a <k>compound interest calculator</k> to compare different rates and different durations.

5. Assume you put $100 into a bank.
How much will your investment be worth after 5 years at an annual interest rate of 8%? You already know the answer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/compounded-interest-calculator.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the <k>compound interest formula</k> reduces to =100*(1+0.08/1)^(1*5), =100*(1.08)^5

6. Assume you put $10,000 into a bank.
How much will your investment be worth after 15 years at an annual interest rate of 4% compounded quarterly? The answer is $18,167. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/compounded-quarterly.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the compound interest formula reduces to =10000*(1+0.04/4)^(4*15), =10000*(1.01)^60

7. Assume you put $10,000 into a bank.
How much will your investment be worth after 10 years at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded monthly? The answer is $16,470. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compound-interest/compounded-monthly.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the compound interest formula always works.

<h2>CAGR</h2>
There's no <k>CAGR</k> function in <k>Excel</k>.
However, simply use the RRI function in Excel to calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of an investment over a period of years.

1. The RRI function below calculates the CAGR of an investment.
The answer is 8%.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/cagr/compound-annual-growth-rate.png">
Note: the RRI function has three arguments (number of years = 5, start = 100, end = 147).

2. The CAGR measures the growth of an investment as if it had grown at a steady rate on an annually compounded basis.
We can check this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/cagr/compounded-annually.png">
which is the same as:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/cagr/steady-rate.png" loading="lazy">
Note: again, number of years or n = 5, start = 100, end = 147, CAGR = 8%.

3. Knowing this, we can easily create a <k>CAGR formula</k> that calculates the compound annual growth rate of an investment in Excel.
A2 = A1 * (1 + CAGR)<sup>n</sup>
end = start * (1 + CAGR)<sup>n</sup>
end/start = (1 + CAGR)<sup>n</sup>
(end/start)<sup>1/n</sup> = (1 + CAGR)
CAGR = (end/start)<sup>1/n</sup> - 1

4. The CAGR formula below does the trick.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/cagr/cagr-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: in other words, to calculate the CAGR of an investment in Excel, divide the value of the investment at the end by the value of the investment at the start.
Next, raise this result to the power of 1 divided by the number of years.
Finally, subtract 1 from this result.
<h2>Loan Amortization Schedule</h2>
This example teaches you how to create a <k>loan amortization schedule</k> in <k>Excel</k>.

1. We use the <a href="pmt.html">PMT function</a> to calculate the monthly payment on a loan with an annual interest rate of 5%, a 2-year duration and a present value (amount borrowed) of $20,000. We use <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a> for the input cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loan-amortization-schedule/pmt-function.png">

2. Use the PPMT function to calculate the principal part of the payment.
The second argument specifies the payment number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loan-amortization-schedule/principal-part.png">

3. Use the IPMT function to calculate the interest part of the payment.
The second argument specifies the payment number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loan-amortization-schedule/interest-part.png" loading="lazy">

4. Update the balance.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loan-amortization-schedule/update-balance.png" loading="lazy">

5. Select the range A7:E7 (first payment) and drag it down one row.
Change the balance formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loan-amortization-schedule/different-balance-formula.png" loading="lazy">

6. Select the range A8:E8 (second payment) and drag it down to row 30. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/loan-amortization-schedule/loan-amortization-schedule.png" loading="lazy">
It takes 24 months to pay off this loan.
See how the principal part increases and the interest part decreases with each payment.
<h2>NPV</h2>
<a href="#net-present-value">Net Present Value</a>  |  <a href="#understanding-the-npv-function">Understanding the NPV function</a>
The correct <k>NPV formula</k> in <k>Excel</k> uses the NPV function to calculate the present value of a series of future cash flows and subtracts the initial investment.
<h3>Net Present Value</h3>
For example, project X requires an initial investment of $100 (cell B5).
1. We expect a profit of $0 at the end of the first period, a profit of $50 at the end of the second period and a profit of $150 at the end of the third period.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/cash-flows.png">

2. The discount rate equals 15%.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/discount-rate.png">
Explanation: this is the rate of return of the best alternative investment.
For example, you could also put your money in a high-yield savings account at an interest rate of 15%.
3. The NPV formula below calculates the <k>net present value</k> of project X.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/net-present-value-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: a positive net present value indicates that the project’s rate of return exceeds the discount rate.
In other words, it's better to invest your money in project X than to put your money in a high-yield savings account at an interest rate of 15%.

4. The NPV formula below calculates the net present value of project Y.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/project-y.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the net present value of project Y is higher than the net present value of project X.
Therefore, project Y is a better investment.
<h3>Understanding the NPV function</h3>
The NPV function simply calculates the present value of a series of future cash flows.
This is not rocket science.

1. For example, project A requires an initial investment of $100 (cell B5).
We expect a profit of $0 at the end of the first period, a profit of $0 at the end of the second period and a profit of $152.09 at the end of the third period.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/net-present-value-of-0.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: a net present value of 0 indicates that the project generates a rate of return equal to the discount rate.
In other words, both options, investing your money in project A or putting your money in a high-yield savings account at an interest rate of 15%, yield an equal return.

2. We can check this.
Assume you put $100 into a bank.
How much will your investment be worth after 3 years at an annual interest rate of 15%? The answer is $152.09. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/compound-interest.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the internal rate of return of project A equals 15%.
The internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value equal to zero.
Visit our page about the <a href="irr.html">IRR function</a> to learn more about this topic.

3. The NPV function simply calculates the present value of a series of future cash flows.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/npv-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. We can check this.
First, we calculate the present value (pv) of each cash flow.
Next, we sum these values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/sum-present-values.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: $152.09 in 3 years is worth $100 right now.
$50 in 2 years is worth 37.81 right now.
$25 in 1 year is worth $21.74 right now.
Would you trade $159.55 for $100 right now? Of course, so project B is a good investment.

5. The NPV formula below calculates the net present value of project B.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/npv/net-present-value.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: project B is a good investment because the net present value ($159.55 - $100) is greater than 0. 
<h2>IRR</h2>
<a href="#simple-irr-example">Simple IRR example</a>  |  <a href="#present-values">Present Values</a>  |  <a href="#irr-rule">IRR rule</a>
Use the <k>IRR function</k> in <k>Excel</k> to calculate a project's internal rate of return.
The internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value equal to zero.
<h3>Simple IRR example</h3>
For example, project A requires an initial investment of $100 (cell B5).
1. We expect a profit of $0 at the end of the first period, a profit of $0 at the end of the second period and a profit of $152.09 at the end of the third period.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/cash-flows.png">
Note: the discount rate equals 10%.
This is the rate of return of the best alternative investment.
For example, you could also put your money in a savings account at an interest rate of 10%.
2. The correct <a href="npv.html">NPV formula</a> in Excel uses the NPV function to calculate the present value of a series of future cash flows and subtracts the initial investment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/net-present-value.png">
Explanation: a positive net present value indicates that the project’s rate of return exceeds the discount rate.
In other words, it's better to invest your money in project A than to put your money in a savings account at an interest rate of 10%.

3. The IRR function below calculates the <k>internal rate of return</k> of project A.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/irr-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. The internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value equal to zero.
To clearly see this, replace the discount rate of 10% in cell B2 with 15%.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/net-present-value-of-0.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: a net present value of 0 indicates that the project generates a rate of return equal to the discount rate.
In other words, both options, investing your money in project A or putting your money in a high-yield savings account at an interest rate of 15%, yield an equal return.

5. We can check this.
Assume you put $100 into a bank.
How much will your investment be worth after 3 years at an annual interest rate of 15%? The answer is $152.09. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/compound-interest.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: you can compare the performance of a project to a savings account with an interest rate equal to the IRR.
<h3>Present Values</h3>
For example, project B requires an initial investment of $100 (cell B5).We expect a profit of $25 at the end of the first period, a profit of $50 at the end of the second period and a profit of $152.09 at the end of the third period.

1. The IRR function below calculates the internal rate of return of project B.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/internal-rate-of-return.png" loading="lazy">

2. Again, the internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value equal to zero.
To clearly see this, replace the discount rate of 15% in cell B2 with 39%.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/npv-equals-0.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: a net present value of 0 indicates that the project generates a rate of return equal to the discount rate.
In other words, both options, investing your money in project B or putting your money in a high-yield savings account at an interest rate of 39%, yield an equal return.

3. We can check this.
First, we calculate the present value (pv) of each cash flow.
Next, we sum these values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/sum-present-values.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: instead of investing $100 in project B, you could also put $17.95 in a savings account for 1 year, $25.77 in a savings account for 2 years and $56.28 in a savings account for three years, at an annual interest rate equal to the IRR (39%).
<h3>IRR rule</h3>
The IRR rule states that if the IRR is greater than the required rate of return, you should accept the project.
IRR values are frequently used to compare investments.

1. The IRR function below calculates the internal rate of return of project X.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/irr.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: if the required rate of return equals 15%, you should accept this project because the IRR of this project equals 29%.

2. The IRR function below calculates the internal rate of return of project Y.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/higher-irr.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: in general, a higher IRR indicates a better investment.
Therefore, project Y is a better investment than project X.

3. The IRR function below calculates the internal rate of return of project Z.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/irr/low-cash-flows.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: a higher IRR isn't always better.
Project Z has a higher IRR than project Y but the cash flows are much lower.
<h2>Depreciation</h2>
<a href="#sln">SLN</a>  |  <a href="#syd">SYD</a>  |  <a href="#db">DB</a>  |  <a href="#ddb">DDB</a>  |  <a href="#vdb">VDB</a>
<k>Excel</k> offers five different <k>depreciation functions</k>.
We consider an asset with an initial cost of $10,000, a salvage value (residual value) of $1000 and a useful life of 10 periods (years).
Below you can find the results of all five functions.
Each function will be explained separately in the next 5 paragraphs.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/depreciation-results.png">
Most assets lose more value in the beginning of their useful life.
The SYD, DB, DDB and VDB functions have this property.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/depreciation-chart.png">
<h3>SLN</h3>
The SLN (Straight Line) function is easy.
Each year the <k>depreciation value</k> is the same.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/sln-function.png" loading="lazy">
The SLN function performs the following calculation.
Deprecation Value = (10,000 - 1,000) / 10 = 900.00. If we subtract this value 10 times, the asset depreciates from 10,000 to 1000 in 10 years (see first picture, bottom half).
<h3>SYD</h3>
The SYD (Sum of Years' Digits) function is also easy.
As you can see below, this function also requires the period number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/syd-function.png" loading="lazy">
The SYD function performs the following calculations.
A useful life of 10 years results in a sum of years of 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55. The asset loses 9000 in value.
Depreciation value period 1 = 10/55 * 9000 = 1,636.36. Deprecation value period 2 = 9/55 * 9000 = 1,472,73, etc.
If we subtract these values, the asset depreciates from 10,000 to 1000 in 10 years (see first picture, bottom half).
<h3>DB</h3>
The DB (Declining Balance) function is a bit more complicated.
It uses a fixed rate to calculate the depreciation values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/db-function.png" loading="lazy">
The DB function performs the following calculations.
Fixed rate = 1 - ((salvage / cost) ^ (1 / life)) = 1 - (1000/10,000)^(1/10) = 1 - 0.7943282347 = 0.206 (rounded to 3 decimal places).
Depreciation value period 1 = 10,000 * 0.206 = 2,060.00. Deprecation value period 2 = (10,000 - 2,060.00) * 0.206 = 1635.64, etc.
If we subtract these values, the asset depreciates from 10,000 to 995.88 in 10 years (see first picture, bottom half).
Note: the DB function has a fifth optional argument.
You can use this argument to indicate the number of months to go in the first year (If omitted, it is assumed to be 12).
For example, set this argument to 9 if you purchase your asset at the beginning of the second quarter in year 1 (9 months to go in the first year).Excel uses a slightly different formula to calculate the deprecation value for the first and last period (the last period represents an 11th year with only 3 months).
<h3>DDB</h3>
The DDB (Double Declining Balance) function is easy again.
However, sometimes you don't reach the salvage value when you use this function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/ddb-function.png" loading="lazy">
The DDB function performs the following calculations.
A useful life of 10 years results in a rate of 1/10 = 0.1. Because this function is called Double Declining Balance we double this rate (factor = 2).
Depreciation value period 1 = 10,000 * 0.2 = 2,000.00. Deprecation value period 2 = (10,000 - 2,000.00) * 0.2 = 1600.00, etc.
As said earlier, sometimes you don't reach the salvage value when you use this function.
In this example, if we subtract the depreciation values, the asset depreciates from 10,000 to 1073.74 in 10 years (see first picture, bottom half).
However, read on to fix this.
Note: the DDB function has a fifth optional argument.
You can use this argument to use a different factor.
<h3>VDB</h3>
The VDB (Variable Declining Balance) function uses the DDB (Double Declining Balance) method by default.
The 4th argument indicates the starting period, the 5th argument indicates the ending period.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/depreciation/vdb-function.png" loading="lazy">
The VDB function performs the same calculations as the DDB function.
However, it switches to Straight Line calculation (yellow values) to make sure you reach the salvage value (see first picture, bottom half).
It only switches to Straight Line calculation when Depreciation Value, Straight Line is higher than Depreciation Value, DDB.
In period 8, Depreciation Value, DDB = 419.43. We still have 2097.15 - 1000 (see first picture, bottom half) to depreciate.
If we use the Straight Line method this results in 3 remaining depreciation values of 1097.15 / 3 = 365.72. Depreciation Value, Straight Line is not higher so we do not switch.
In period 9, Depreciation Value, DDB = 335.54. We still have 1677.72 - 1000 (see first picture, bottom half) to depreciate.
If we use Straight line method this results in 2 remaining depreciation values of 677.72 / 2 = 338.86. Depreciation Value, Straight Line is higher so we switch to Straight Line calculation.
Note: the VDB function is much more versatile than the DDB function.
It can calculate the depreciation value of multiple periods.
In this example, =VDB(Cost,Salvage,Life,0,3) reduces to 2000 + 1600 + 1280 = 4880. It contains a 6th and 7th optional argument.
You can use the 6th argument to use a different factor.
If you set the 7th argument to TRUE it does not switch to Straight Line calculation (the same as DDB).
<h2>Profit Margin</h2>
<a href="#gross-profit-margin">Gross Profit Margin</a>  |  <a href="#operating-profit-margin">Operating Profit Margin</a>  |  <a href="#net-profit-margin">Net Profit Margin</a>
Calculating gross <k>profit margin</k>, operating profit margin and <k>net profit margin in Excel</k> is easy.
Simply use the formulas explained on this page.
<h3>Gross Profit Margin</h3>
Assume your business had a total revenue of $10,000 in July and the cost of goods sold (COGS) equaled $4,000. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/profit-margin/total-revenue-and-cogs.png">
To calculate the gross profit margin (GPM), use the following formula:
<table class="fraction" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:left">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" nowrap>
Gross Profit MarginGPM
</td>
<td width="24" rowspan="2" nowrap> = </td>
<td nowrap>Total Revenue - COGS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="upper_line">Total Revenue</td>
</tr>

<h2>AVERAGE</h2>
<a href="#average">Average</a>  |  <a href="#averagea">AverageA</a>  |  <a href="#average-top-3">Average Top 3</a>  |  <a href="#averageif">AverageIf</a>  |  <a href="#weighted-average">Weighted Average</a>  |  <a href="#moving-average">Moving Average</a>
The <k>AVERAGE function</k> in <k>Excel</k> calculates the average (arithmetic mean) of a group of numbers.
The AVERAGE function ignores logical values, empty cells and cells that contain text.
<h3>Average</h3>
Instead of using the AVERAGE function, use SUM and COUNT.

1. For example, the AVERAGE function below calculates the <k>average</k> of the numbers in cells A1 through A3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/average-function.png">

2. The formula below produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/sum-count.png">

3. The following AVERAGE function calculates the average of the numbers in cells A1 through A3 and the number 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/calculate-average.png" loading="lazy">

4. The AVERAGE function ignores logical values (TRUE or FALSE), empty cells and cells that contain text.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/logical-values-empty-cells-text-are-ignored.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>AverageA</h3>
The AVERAGEA function also returns the average (arithmetic mean) of a group of numbers.
However, the logical value FALSE and cells that contain text evaluate to 0 and the logical value TRUE evaluates to 1. The AVERAGEA function also ignores empty cells.

1. For example, take a look at the AVERAGEA function below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/averagea-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. You can use the normal AVERAGE function to check this result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/normal-average-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Average Top 3</h3>
Use AVERAGE and LARGE in Excel to calculate the average of the top 3 numbers in a data set.

1. First, the AVERAGE function below calculates the average of the numbers in cells A1 through A6. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/simple-average.png" loading="lazy">

2. For example, to find the third largest number, use the following LARGE function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/large-function.png" loading="lazy">

3. The formula below calculates the average of the top 3 numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/average-top-3.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the LARGE function returns the array constant {20,15,10}.
This array constant is used as an argument for the AVERAGE function, giving a result of 15. 
<h3>AverageIf</h3>
To calculate the average of cells that meet one criteria, use the <a href="averageif.html">AVERAGEIF function</a> in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/averageif-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Weighted Average</h3>
To calculate a <a href="weighted-average.html">weighted average</a> in Excel, use SUMPRODUCT and SUM.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/weighted-average.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Moving Average</h3>
Use the Analysis Toolpak to calculate the <a href="moving-average.html">moving average</a> of a time series in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/average/moving-average.png" loading="lazy">
Note: a moving average is used to smooth out irregularities (peaks and valleys) to easily recognize trends.
<h2>Negative Numbers to Zero</h2>
A clever <k>Excel</k> trick to change <k>negative numbers to zero</k> but leave positive numbers unchanged.
Below you can find two columns with numbers.
To subtract the numbers in column B from the numbers in column A, execute the following steps.

1. Select cell C1. 

2. Enter the formula =A1-B1

3. Click the lower right corner of cell C1 and drag the formula down.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/negative-numbers-to-zero/negative-numbers-to-zero-example.png">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/negative-numbers-to-zero/negative-numbers.png">

4. To change the negative numbers to zero but leave the positive numbers unchanged, instead of =A1-B1, use =MAX(0,A1-B1) and drag the function down.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/negative-numbers-to-zero/negative-numbers-to-zero-result.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the MAX function returns the maximum of two values.
If the result of the formula is negative, the function returns 0. 
<h2>Random Numbers</h2>
<a href="#rand">Rand</a>  |  <a href="#randbetween">RandBetween</a>  |  <a href="#randarray">RandArray</a>
Excel has two very useful functions when it comes to generating <k>random numbers</k>.
<k>RAND</k> and <k>RANDBETWEEN</k>.
<h3>Rand</h3>
The RAND function generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1. 

1. Select cell A1. 

2. Type =RAND() and press Enter.
The RAND function takes no arguments.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/rand-function.png">

3. To generate a list of random numbers, select cell A1, click on the lower right corner of cell A1 and drag it down.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/list-of-random-numbers.png">
Note that cell A1 has changed.
That is because random numbers change every time a cell on the sheet is calculated.

4. If you don't want this,  simply copy the random numbers and paste them as values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/paste-as-values.png" loading="lazy">

5. Select cell C1 and look at the formula bar.
This cell holds a value now and not the RAND function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/values.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>RandBetween</h3>
The RANDBETWEEN function generates a random whole number between two boundaries.

1. Select cell A1. 

2. Type RANDBETWEEN(50,75) and press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/randbetween-function.png" loading="lazy">

3. If you want to generate random decimal numbers between 50 and 75, modify the RAND function as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/modified-rand-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>RandArray</h3>
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, you can use the magic RANDARRAY function.

1. By default, the RANDARRAY function generates random decimal numbers between 0 and 1. The array below consists of 5 rows and 2 columns.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/randarray-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell A1, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

2. The RANDARRAY function below generates an array of integers, 10 rows by 1 column, between 20 and 80. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/random-numbers/generate-random-integers.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the Boolean TRUE (fifth argument) tells the RANDARRAY function to return an array of integers.
Use FALSE to return an array of decimal numbers between 20 and 80. 
<h2>RANK</h2>
The <k>RANK function</k> in Excel returns the rank of a number in a list of numbers.
Use RANK.AVG to return the average rank if more than one number has the same rank.

1. If the third argument is omitted (or 0), <k>Excel</k> ranks the largest number first, second largest number second, etc.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/descending-order.png">
Note: when we drag this formula down, the <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> ($A$1:$A$9) stays the same, while the relative reference (A1) changes to A2, A3, A4, etc.

2. If the third argument is 1, Excel ranks the smallest number first, second smallest number second, etc.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/ascending-order.png">
Note: the RANK function is an old function.
Microsoft Excel recommends using the new RANK.EQ function in Excel 2010 or later.
There's no difference at all between these two functions.

3. The RANK.AVG function in Excel 2010 or later returns the average rank if more than one number has the same rank.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/average-rank.png" loading="lazy">

4. To create a clean RANK function, use a named range instead of an absolute range reference.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/rank-function-using-named-range.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Data refers to the range A1:A9. 
If you're using Excel 365 or Excel 2021, create the following <k>RANK formula</k>.
This formula will amaze and impress your co-workers.

5. We want to show the top 3 results.
Enter the value 3 into cell D2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/top-3.png" loading="lazy">

6. To find the third largest score, use the LARGE function below.
The <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Scores refers to the range B2:B8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/large-function.png" loading="lazy">

7. The <a href="filter-function.html">FILTER function</a> below shows all students with a score greater than or equal to the third largest score.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/filter-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the FILTER function, entered into cell F2, fills multiple cells.
Wow!

8. Finally, add the <a href="sort-function.html">SORT function</a> to sort by the second column (second argument), in descending order (third argument).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/rank-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 1 to sort in ascending order, use -1 to sort in descending order.

9. This RANK formula works for every N.
For example, enter the value 5 into cell D2 to show the top 5 results.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rank/show-top-5-results.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this dynamic array formula, entered into cell F2, fills multiple cells.
This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
Tip: download the Excel file (right side of this page) and give it a try.
<h2>Percentiles and Quartiles</h2>
This example teaches you how to use <k>PERCENTILE and QUARTILE</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
Below you can find a list of scores (green fill for illustration only).

1. Use the PERCENTILE function shown below to calculate the 30th percentile.
Excel returns the value 12.7. This means that 30% (6 out of 20) of the scores are lower or equal to 12.7
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/percentiles-quartiles/30th-percentile.png">
Note: The second argument of the PERCENTILE function must be a decimal number between 0 and 1. Excel uses a slightly different algorithm to calculate percentiles and quartiles than you find in most statistics books.
If you're interested, download the Excel file.

2. Use the PERCENTILE function shown below to calculate the 90th percentile.
Excel returns the value 61.7. This means that 90% (18 out of 20) of the scores are lower or equal to 61.7
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/percentiles-quartiles/90th-percentile.png">

3. Use the QUARTILE function shown below to calculate the 1st quartile.
Excel returns the value 11.25. This means that 25% (5 out of 20) of the scores are lower or equal to 11.25
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/percentiles-quartiles/1st-quartile.png" loading="lazy">
Note: The second argument of the QUARTILE function must be a number between 0 and 4. PERCENTILE(A1:A20,0.25) gives the exact same result.
It's up to you which function you would like to use for quartiles.
Below you can find an overview.
<table class="gridtable" width="100%">
<tr>
<th>Minimum Value</th>
<td height="36">PERCENTILE(A1:A20,0)</td>
<td>QUARTILE(A1:A20,0)</td>
<td>MIN(A1:A20)</td>

<h2>Box and Whisker Plot</h2>
<a href="#simple-box-whisker-plot">Simple Box and Whisker Plot</a>  |  <a href="#outliers">Outliers</a>  |  <a href="#box-plot-calculations">Box Plot Calculations</a>
This example teaches you how to create a <k>box and whisker plot</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
A box and whisker plot shows the minimum value, first <a href="percentiles-quartiles.html">quartile</a>, median, third quartile and maximum value of a data set.
<h3>Simple Box and Whisker Plot</h3>

1. For example, select the range A1:A7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/odd-number-of-data-points.png">
Note: you don't have to <a href="../data-analysis/sort.html">sort</a> the data points from smallest to largest, but it will help you understand the box and whisker plot.

2. On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the Statistic Chart symbol.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/insert-box-whisker-plot.png">

3. Click <k>Box and Whisker</k>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/click-box-whisker.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/simple-box-whisker-plot.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the middle line of the box represents the median or middle number (8).
The x in the box represents the mean (also 8 in this example).
The median divides the data set into a bottom half {2, 4, 5} and a top half {10, 12, 15}.
The bottom line of the box represents the median of the bottom half or 1st quartile (4).
The top line of the box represents the median of the top half or 3rd quartile (12).
The whiskers (vertical lines) extend from the ends of the box to the minimum value (2) and maximum value (15).
<h3>Outliers</h3>

1. For example, select the range A1:A11. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/data-set-with-outlier.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the median or middle number (8) divides the data set into two halves: {1, 2, 2, 4, 5} and {10, 12, 15, 18, 35}.
The 1st quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>) is the median of the first half.
Q<sub>1</sub> = 2. The 3rd quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>) is the median of the second half.
Q<sub>3</sub> = 15. 

2. On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the Statistic Chart symbol.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/insert-box-whisker-plot.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click Box and Whisker.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/click-box-whisker.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/box-whisker-plot-with-outlier.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the interquartile range (IQR) is defined as the distance between the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile.
In this example, IQR = Q<sub>3</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub> = 15 - 2 = 13. A data point is considered an outlier if it exceeds a distance of 1.5 times the IQR below the 1st quartile (Q<sub>1</sub> - 1.5 * IQR = 2 - 1.5 * 13 = -17.5) or 1.5 times the IQR above the 3rd quartile (Q<sub>3</sub> + 1.5 * IQR = 15 + 1.5 * 13 = 34.5).
Therefore, in this example, 35 is considered an outlier.
As a result, the top whisker extends to the largest value (18) within this range.

4. Change the last data point to 34. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/change-data-point.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/box-whisker-plot-without-outlier.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: all data points are between -17.5 and 34.5. As a result, the whiskers extend to the minimum value (2) and maximum value (34).
<h3>Box Plot Calculations</h3>
Most of the time, you can cannot easily determine the 1st quartile and 3rd quartile without performing calculations.

1. For example, select the even number of data points below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/even-number-of-data-points.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the Statistic Chart symbol.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/insert-box-whisker-plot.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click Box and Whisker.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/click-box-whisker.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/box-whisker-plot.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: Excel uses the QUARTILE.EXC function to calculate the 1st quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>), 2nd quartile (Q<sub>2</sub> or median) and 3rd quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>).
This function interpolates between two values to calculate a quartile.
In this example, n = 8 (number of data points).

4. Q<sub>1</sub> = 1/4*(n+1)th value = 1/4*(8+1)th value = 2 1/4th value = 4 + 1/4 * (5-4) = 4 1/4. You can verify this number by using the QUARTILE.EXC function or looking at the box and whisker plot.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/first-quartile.png" loading="lazy">

5. Q<sub>2</sub> = 1/2*(n+1)th value = 1/2*(8+1)th value = 4 1/2th value = 8 + 1/2 * (10-8) = 9. This makes sense, the median is the average of the middle two numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/box-whisker-plot/median.png" loading="lazy">

6. Q<sub>3</sub> = 3/4*(n+1)th value = 3/4*(8+1)th value = 6 3/4th value = 12 + 3/4 * (15-12) = 14 1/4. Again, you can verify this number by using the QUARTILE.EXC function or looking at the box and whisker plot.

<h2>AVERAGEIF</h2>
The <k>AVERAGEIF</k> function in <k>Excel</k> calculates the average of cells that meet one criteria.
AVERAGEIFS calculates the average of cells that meet multiple criteria.

1. For example, the <k>AVERAGEIF function</k> below (two arguments) calculates the average of all values in the range A1:A7 that are greater than 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/calculate-average-if-greater-than-0.png">

2. The AVERAGEIF function below (three arguments, last argument is the range to average) calculates the average of all values in the range B1:B7 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A7 contain exactly Apple.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/averageif-with-text-criteria.png">

3. The AVERAGEIF function below calculates the average of all values in the range B1:B7 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A7 do not contain exactly Banana.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/calculate-average-if-not-equal-to.png" loading="lazy">

4. The AVERAGEIF function below calculates the average of all values in the range B1:B7 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A7 contain a series of zero or more characters + berry.
An asterisk (*) matches a series of zero or more characters.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/averageif-function-with-asterisk.png" loading="lazy">

5. The AVERAGEIF function below calculates the average of all values in the range B1:B7 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A7 contain exactly 4 characters.
A question mark (?) matches exactly one character.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/averageif-function-with-question-marks.png" loading="lazy">
The AVERAGEIFS function (with the letter S at the end) in Excel calculates the average of cells that meet multiple criteria.

6. The AVERAGEIFS function below calculates the average of all values in the range A1:A7 that are greater than or equal to 500 and less than or equal to 1000. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/calculate-average-if-between-two-numbers.png" loading="lazy">
Note: first argument is the range to average, followed by two or more range/criteria pairs.

7. The AVERAGEIFS function below calculates the average of all values in the range C1:C7 if the corresponding cells in the range A1:A7 contain exactly Apple and the corresponding cells in the range B1:B7 contain exactly Red.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/averageif/averageifs-with-text-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
Note: again, the first argument is the range to average, followed by two or more range/criteria pairs.
<h2>FORECAST</h2>
<a href="#forecast.linear">FORECAST.LINEAR</a>  |  <a href="#forecast.ets">FORECAST.ETS</a>  |  <a href="#forecast-sheet">Forecast Sheet</a>
The <k>FORECAST</k> (or FORECAST.LINEAR) function in <k>Excel</k> predicts a future value along a linear trend.
The FORECAST.ETS function in Excel predicts a future value using Exponential Triple Smoothing, which takes into account seasonality.
Note: the FORECAST function is an old function.
Microsoft Excel recommends using the new FORECAST.LINEAR function which produces the exact same result.
<h3>FORECAST.LINEAR</h3>

1. The <k>FORECAST.LINEAR function</k> below predicts a future value along a linear trend.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/forecast.linear-function.png">
Explanation: when we drag the FORECAST.LINEAR function down, the <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute references</a> ($B$2:$B$11 and $A$2:$A$11) stay the same, while the relative reference (A12) changes to A13 and A14. 

2. Enter the value 89 into cell C11, select the range A1:C14 and insert a <a href="scatter-plot.html">scatter plot</a> with straight lines and markers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/linear-trend.png">
Note: when you add a <a href="trendline.html">trendline</a> to an Excel chart, Excel can display the equation in a chart.
This equation predicts the same future values.
<h3>FORECAST.ETS</h3>
The <k>FORECAST.ETS function</k> in Excel 2016 or later is a great function which can detect a seasonal pattern.

1. The FORECAST.ETS function below predicts a future value using Exponential Triple Smoothing.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/forecast.ets-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the last 3 arguments are optional.
The fourth argument indicates the length of the seasonal pattern.
The default value of 1 indicates seasonality is detected automatically.

2. Enter the value 49 into cell C13, select the range A1:C17 and insert a scatter plot with straight lines and markers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/seasonal-pattern.png" loading="lazy">

3. You can use the FORECAST.ETS.SEASONALITY function to find the length of the seasonal pattern.
After seeing the chart, you probably already know the answer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/forecast.ets.seasonality-function.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: in this example, when using the FORECAST.ETS function, you can also use the value 4 for the fourth argument.
<h3>Forecast Sheet</h3>
Use the <k>Forecast Sheet</k> tool in Excel 2016 or later to automatically create a visual forecast worksheet.

1. Select the range A1:B13 shown above.

2. On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click Forecast Sheet.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/click-forecast-sheet.png" loading="lazy">
Excel launches the dialog box shown below.

3. Specify when the forecast ends, set a confidence interval (95% by default), detect seasonality automatically or manually set the length of the seasonal pattern, etc.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/create-forecast-worksheet.png" loading="lazy">

4. Click Create.
This tool uses the FORECAST.ETS function and calculates the same future values.
The lower and upper confidence bounds are a nice bonus.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/forecast/visual-forecast-worksheet.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: in period 13, we can be 95% confident that the number of visitors will be between 86 and 94. 
<h2>MAXIFS and MINIFS</h2>
Use MAXIFS and MINIFS in <k>Excel 2016</k> or later to find the maximum and minimum value based on one criteria or multiple criteria.

1. For example, the <k>MAXIFS function</k> below finds the highest female score.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maxifs-minifs/maxifs-one-criteria.png">
Note: the first argument (D2:D12 in this example) is always the range in which the maximum or minimum will be determined.
This MAXIFS function has 1 range/criteria pair (B2:B12/Female).

2. The <k>MINIFS function</k> below finds the lowest female score.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maxifs-minifs/minifs-one-criteria.png">

3. For example, the MAXIFS function below finds the highest female score in Canada.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maxifs-minifs/maxifs-multiple-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this MAXIFS function has 2 range/criteria pairs (B2:B12/Female and C2:C12/Canada).
MAXIFS and MINIFS functions can handle up to 126 range/criteria pairs.

4. The MAXIFS function below finds the highest score below 60. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maxifs-minifs/maxifs-one-range.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this MAXIFS function only uses the range D2:D12. 
<h2>Weighted Average</h2>
To calculate a <k>weighted average</k> in <k>Excel</k>, simply use SUMPRODUCT and SUM.

1. First, the AVERAGE function below calculates the normal average of three scores.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/weighted-average/normal-average.png">
Suppose your teacher says, "The test counts twice as much as the quiz and the final exam counts three times as much as the quiz".

2. Below you can find the corresponding weights of the scores.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/weighted-average/weights.png">
The formula below calculates the weighted average of these scores.
<table class="fraction" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:left">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" nowrap>
Weighted AverageWA
</td>
<td width="24" rowspan="2" nowrap> = </td>
<td nowrap>20 + 40 + 40 + 90 + 90 + 90</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="upper_line">6</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table class="fraction" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:left">
<tr>
<td width="24" rowspan="2" nowrap> = </td>
<td nowrap>370</td>
<td width="24" rowspan="2" nowrap> = </td>
<td rowspan="2" nowrap>61.67</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="upper_line">6</td>
</tr>
</table>

3. We can use the SUMPRODUCT function in Excel to calculate the number above the fraction line (370).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/weighted-average/sumproduct-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the SUMPRODUCT function performs this calculation: (20 * 1) + (40 * 2) + (90 * 3) = 370. 

4. We can use the SUM function in Excel to calculate the number below the fraction line (6).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/weighted-average/sum-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. Use the functions at step 3 and step 4 to calculate the weighted average of these scores in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/weighted-average/weighted-average.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>MODE</h2>
Use the <k>MODE function in Excel</k> to find the most frequently occurring number in a list of numbers.
Use MODE.MULT to find multiple modes.

1. The MODE function below returns the most frequently occurring number (8).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/mode-function.png">

2. The new <k>MODE.SNGL</k> function (SNGL stands for single) produces the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/mode.sngl.png">

3. Change the value in cell A2 to 5. In this example, there are multiple modes (5 and 8).
MODE and MODE.SNGL always return a single mode.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/single-mode.png" loading="lazy">

4. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply use the <k>MODE.MULT</k> function to find multiple modes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/mode.mult.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the MODE.MULT function, entered into cell A8, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
If you don't have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, execute the following steps to find multiple modes.

5. Select multiple cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/select-multiple-cells.png" loading="lazy">

6. Enter the MODE.MULT function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/enter-mode.mult-function.png" loading="lazy">

7. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/array-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
To delete this array formula, select the range A8:A10 and press Delete.
In this example, there are only two modes (5 and 8) so we could have selected two cells at step 5. 

8. Change the value in cell A6 to 3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/multiple-modes.png" loading="lazy">

9. The MODE function only works with numbers.
Use INDEX, MODE and MATCH to find the <a href="most-frequently-occurring-word.html">most frequently occurring word</a> in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mode/most-frequently-occurring-word.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Standard Deviation</h2>
<a href="#what-is-standard-deviation?">What is Standard Deviation?</a>  |  <a href="#stdev.p">STDEV.P</a>  |  <a href="#stdev.s">STDEV.S</a>  |  <a href="#variance">Variance</a>
This page explains how to calculate the <k>standard deviation</k> based on the entire population using the STDEV.P function in <k>Excel</k> and how to estimate the standard deviation based on a sample using the STDEV.S function in Excel.
<h3>What is Standard Deviation?</h3>
Standard deviation is a number that tells you how far numbers are from their mean.

1. For example, the numbers below have a mean (average) of 10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/standard-deviation-of-zero.png">
Explanation: the numbers are all the same which means there's no variation.
As a result, the numbers have a standard deviation of zero.
The STDEV function is an old function.
Microsoft Excel recommends using the new STEDV.S function which produces the exact same result.

2. The numbers below also have a mean (average) of 10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/low-standard-deviation.png">
Explanation: the numbers are close to the mean.
As a result, the numbers have a low standard deviation.

3. The numbers below also have a mean (average) of 10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/high-standard-deviation.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the numbers are spread out.
As a result, the numbers have a high standard deviation.
<h3>STDEV.P</h3>
The STDEV.P function (the P stands for Population) in Excel calculates the standard deviation based on the entire population.
For example, you're teaching a group of 5 students.You have the test scores of <u>all</u> students.
The entire population consists of 5 data points.
The STDEV.P function uses the following formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/formula-standard-deviation-population.png" loading="lazy">
In this example, x<sub>1</sub> = 5, x<sub>2</sub> = 1, x<sub>3</sub> = 4, x<sub>4</sub> = 6, x<sub>5</sub> = 9, μ = 5 (mean), N = 5 (number of data points).

1. Calculate the mean (μ).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/calculate-the-mean.png" loading="lazy">

2. For each number, calculate the distance to the mean.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/distance-to-the-mean.png" loading="lazy">

3. For each number, square this distance.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/square-of-the-distance-to-the-mean.png" loading="lazy">

4. Sum (∑) these values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/sum-these-values.png" loading="lazy">

5. Divide by the number of data points (N = 5).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/divide-by-number-of-data-points.png" loading="lazy">

6. Take the <a href="square-root.html">square root</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/standard-deviation-population.png" loading="lazy">

7. Fortunately, the STDEV.P function in Excel can execute all these steps for you.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/stdev.p-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>STDEV.S</h3>
The STDEV.S function (the S stands for Sample) in Excel estimates the standard deviation based on a sample.
For example, you're teaching a large group of students.You <u>only</u> have the test scores of 5 students.
The sample size equals 5. The STDEV.S function uses the following formula:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/formula-standard-deviation-sample.png" loading="lazy">
In this example, x<sub>1</sub>=5, x<sub>2</sub>=1, x<sub>3</sub>=4, x<sub>4</sub>=6, x<sub>5</sub>=9 (same numbers as above), x<U+0304>=5 (sample mean), n=5 (sample size).

1. Repeat steps 1-5 above but at step 5 divide by n-1 instead of N.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/divide-by-n-1.png" loading="lazy">

2. Take the <a href="square-root.html">square root</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/standard-deviation-sample.png" loading="lazy">

3. Fortunately, the STDEV.S function in Excel can execute all these steps for you.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/stdev.s-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: why do we divide by n - 1 instead of by n when we estimate the standard deviation based on a sample? Bessel's correction states that dividing by n-1 instead of by n gives a better estimation of the standard deviation.
<h3>Variance</h3>
Variance is the square of the standard deviation.
It's that simple.
Sometimes it's easier to use the variance when solving statistical problems.

1. The VAR.P function below calculates the variance based on the entire population.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/var.p-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: you already knew this answer (see step 5 under <a href="standard-deviation.html#stdev.p">STDEV.P</a>).
Take the square root of this result to find the standard deviation based on the entire population.

2. The VAR.S function below estimates the variance based on a sample.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/var.s-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: you already knew this answer (see step 1 under <a href="standard-deviation.html#stdev.s">STDEV.S</a>).
Take the square root of this result to find the standard deviation based on a sample.

3. VAR and VAR.S produce the exact same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/standard-deviation/var-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Microsoft Excel recommends using the new VAR.S function.
<h2>FREQUENCY</h2>
The <k>FREQUENCY function</k> in <k>Excel</k> calculates how often values occur within the ranges you specify in a bin table.
You can also use the COUNTIFS function to create a <k>frequency distribution</k>.

1. First, enter the bin numbers (upper levels) in the range C4:C8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/bin-numbers.png">

2. Select the range D4:D9 (extra cell), enter the FREQUENCY function shown below (without the curly braces) and finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/frequency-function.png">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
To delete this array formula, select the range D4:D9 and press Delete.

3. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply select cell D4, enter the FREQUENCY function and press Enter.
Bye bye curly braces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/dynamic-array-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the FREQUENCY function, entered into cell D4, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

4. <a href="hide-columns-rows.html#hide">Hide</a> the column with the bin numbers (upper levels) and insert a column with proper bin labels.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/frequency-distribution.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 1 value is less than or equal to 20, 8 values are greater than or equal to 21 and less than or equal to 25, etc.
At step 2, we selected the range D4:D9 (instead of the range D4:D8).
As a result, the FREQUENCY function also counts the number of values that are greater than 40. 

5. You can also use the Analysis Toolpak to create a <a href="histogram.html">histogram</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/histogram.png" loading="lazy">

6. Change the bin numbers.
Select the range D4:D9 (no extra cell), enter the FREQUENCY function shown below (without the curly braces) and finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/no-extra-cell.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the last bin number is greater than or equal to the maximum value (52).
As a result, we don't need an extra cell to count the number of values that are greater than 60. 

7. You can also use the <a href="../functions/count-sum-functions.html#countifs">COUNTIFS function</a> to create a frequency distribution.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/frequency/countifs-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the COUNTIFS function in Excel counts cells based on two or more criteria.
The COUNTIFS function shown above has 2 range/criteria pairs.
The &amp; operator joins ">=" with the value in cell C4 and "&lt;=" with the value in cell D4. You can easily <a href="copy-formula.html#fill-handle">copy this formula</a> to the other cells.
<h2>Chop off Decimals</h2>
<a href="#int">Int</a>  |  <a href="#trunc">Trunc</a>  |  <a href="#decimal-part">Decimal Part</a>
This example illustrates two functions to <k>chop off decimals</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
<k>INT</k> and <k>TRUNC</k>.
<h3>Int</h3>
The INT (Integer) function rounds a number down to the nearest integer (negative numbers become more negative).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/int-function-positive-number.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/int-function-negative-number.png">
Conclusion: the INT function only chops off decimals from positive numbers.
<h3>Trunc</h3>
The TRUNC (Truncate) function always chops off decimals.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/trunc-function-positive-number.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/trunc-function-negative-number.png" loading="lazy">
The TRUNC function can keep any number of decimals.
Simply use the second argument to specify how many decimals you want to keep.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/keep-two-decimals.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/keep-three-decimals.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Decimal Part</h3>
To return just the decimal part of a number, use the following formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/chop-off-decimals/decimal-part.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if the second argument of the TRUNC function is omitted, a value of 0 is assumed.
<h2>Nearest Multiple</h2>
<a href="#mround">Mround</a>  |  <a href="#ceiling">Ceiling</a>  |  <a href="#floor">Floor</a>
This example illustrates three functions to <k>round</k> numbers to a <k>multiple</k> of x in <k>Excel</k>.
<k>MROUND</k>, <k>CEILING</k> and <k>FLOOR</k>.
<h3>Mround</h3>

1. For example, round a number to the nearest multiple of 10.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/nearest-multiple/use-mround-function-round-nearest-multiple-5.png">
<h3>Ceiling</h3>
The same as MROUND but always rounds up.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/nearest-multiple/ceiling-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Floor</h3>
The same as MROUND but always rounds down.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/nearest-multiple/floor-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>EVEN and ODD</h2>
<a href="#even">Even</a>  |  <a href="#odd">Odd</a>  |  <a href="#iseven">IsEven</a>  |  <a href="#isodd">IsOdd</a>
Use <k>EVEN</k> and <k>ODD</k> in <k>Excel</k> to round numbers.
Use ISEVEN or ISODD in Excel to determine if a number is even or odd.
<h3>Even</h3>

1. The EVEN function rounds a positive number up to the nearest even integer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/even-function-positive-number.png">

2. The EVEN function rounds a negative number down to the nearest even integer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/even-function-negative-number.png">
<h3>Odd</h3>

1. The ODD function rounds a positive number up to the nearest odd integer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/odd-function-positive-number.png" loading="lazy">

2. The ODD function rounds a negative number down to the nearest odd integer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/odd-function-negative-number.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>IsEven</h3>
The ISEVEN function returns TRUE if a number is even and FALSE if a number is odd.

1. The ISEVEN function below returns TRUE.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/iseven-true.png" loading="lazy">

2. The ISEVEN function below returns FALSE.

2. The ISODD function below returns FALSE.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/isodd-false.png" loading="lazy">

3. Here's a cool example.
Use <a href="../data-analysis/conditional-formatting.html#conditional-formatting-with-formulas">conditional formatting</a> and the ISODD function to highlight all odd numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/even-odd/odd-numbers.png" loading="lazy">
Note: instead of using ISEVEN or ISODD to determine if a number is even or odd, use the <a href="mod.html">MOD function</a> in Excel.
<h2>MOD</h2>
<a href="#mod-examples">MOD examples</a>  |  <a href="#combine-mod-with-other-functions">Combine MOD with other Functions</a>  |  <a href="#extract-fractional-part">Extract Fractional Part</a>
The <k>MOD function in Excel</k> gives the remainder of a division.
You can use the MOD (<k>Modulus</k>) function to determine whether a number is divisible by another number or to check if a number is even or odd.
<h3>MOD examples</h3>
Let's start with a few simple examples of the MOD function.

1. The MOD function below returns 9. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/mod-function.png">
Explanation: 59 divided by 10 equals 5 with a remainder of 9. 

2. The MOD function below returns 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/modulo-operation.png">
Explanation: 7 divided by 2 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. 

3. The MOD function below returns 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/remainder.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 36 divided by 6 equals 6 with a remainder of 0. 
<h3>Combine MOD with other Functions</h3>
Let's explore the power of the MOD function by combining it with other Excel functions!

1. Use IF and MOD to determine if a number is divisible by another number.
For example, check if the number in cell A1 is divisible by 8. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/if-mod.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 85 divided by 8 equals 10 with a remainder of 5. The MOD function returns 5. As a result, the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> returns No.

2. Change the value in cell A1 to 88. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/divisible-by-8.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 88 divided by 8 equals 11 with a remainder of 0. The MOD function returns 0. As a result, the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> returns Yes (88 is divisible by 8).
You can also use IF and <k>MOD</k> to check if a number is even or odd.

3. Even numbers divided by 2 always give a remainder of 0. For example, 28 divided by 2 equals 14 with a remainder of 0. As a result, the formula below returns Even.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/even.png" loading="lazy">

4. Odd numbers divided by 2 always give a remainder of 1. For example, 29 divided by 2 equals 14 with a remainder of 1. As a result, the formula below returns Odd.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/odd.png" loading="lazy">
Let's check out another cool example.

5. The formula below returns 0 (see orange arrows) for every 3rd row.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/mod-row.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="row-function.html">ROW function</a> returns the row number of a cell.
For the first row, MOD(1,3) = 1 because 1 divided by 3 equals 0 with a remainder 1. For the third row, MOD(3,3) = 0 because 3 divided by 3 equals 1 with a remainder of 0. 
6. Use this formula to sum every 3rd row in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/sum-every-nth-row-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: finish an array formula by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.

<h3>Extract Fractional Part</h3>
To extract the fractional part of a number, use the MOD function with a divisor (second argument) of 1. 

1. The MOD function below returns the fractional part of the value in cell A1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/use-mod-to-extract-fractional-part.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 3 divided by 1 equals 3 with a remainder of 0.45. 

2. Knowing this, we can use the MOD function in Excel to extract the time from a datetime value.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/extract-time-from-datetime-value.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: dates are stored as numbers in Excel and count the number of days since January 0, 1900. The fractional part represents the time as a fraction of a day.

3. To clearly see this, select the range A1:B1 and change the number format to General.
The result is a simple <k>modulo operation</k>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/mod/simple-modulo-operation.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: visit our page about <a href="../examples/date-time-formats.html">Date and Time formats</a> to learn more about this topic.
<h2>Rounding Times</h2>
Use MROUND in Excel to <k>round a time to the nearest 15 minutes</k>, the nearest 30 minutes, the nearest hour, etc.

1. The formula below rounds a time to the nearest 15 minutes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/round-time-to-nearest-15-minutes.png">
Note: if your formula returns a decimal number, don't panic.
Times are handled internally as numbers between 0 and 1. Simply apply a <a href="date-time-formats.html">Time Format</a> to display a time.

2. The formula below rounds a time to the nearest 30 minutes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/round-time-to-nearest-30-minutes.png">

3. The formula below <k>rounds a time to the nearest hour</k>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/round-time-to-nearest-hour.png">

4. FLOOR always rounds down.
The formula below rounds a time down to the nearest hour.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/use-floor-to-round-time-down.png" loading="lazy">

5. CEILING always rounds up.
The formula below rounds a time up to the nearest hour.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/use-ceiling-to-round-time-up.png" loading="lazy">
Note: change the <a href="date-time-formats.html">Time Format</a> to display a time without AM/PM (24 Hour Time Format).

6. Use the ":" (colon) twice to enter a time with seconds in Excel.
For example, 2 hours, 43 minutes and 15 seconds.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/time-with-seconds.png" loading="lazy">

7. The CEILING function below rounds this time up to the next minute.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/rounding-times/round-up-to-next-minute.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: use the <a href="format-painter.html">Format Painter</a> to quickly copy the format of cell A1 to cell B1. 
<h2>IFERROR</h2>
Use the <k>IFERROR function</k> in <k>Excel</k> to return an alternative result, such as text, when a formula evaluates to an error.

1. For example, Excel returns the #DIV/0! error when a formula tries to divide a number by 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iferror/div-error.png">

2. If the formula evaluates to an error, the IFERROR function below returns a friendly message.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iferror/iferror-function.png">

3. If the formula does not evaluate to an error, the IFERROR function simply returns the result of the formula.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iferror/formula-result.png" loading="lazy">

4. For example, Excel returns the #N/A error when the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> cannot find a match.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iferror/na-error.png" loading="lazy">

5. If the VLOOKUP function evaluates to an error, the IFERROR function below returns a friendly message.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iferror/iferror-vlookup.png" loading="lazy">

6. If the VLOOKUP function does not evaluate to an error, the IFERROR function simply returns the result of the VLOOKUP function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iferror/vlookup-result.png" loading="lazy">              
Note: the IFERROR function catches the following errors: #DIV/0!, #N/A, #VALUE!, #REF!, #NUM!, #NAME? and #NULL!.
For example, the IFERROR function shown above also catches the #NAME? error if you accidentally misspell the word VLOOKUP.Use the <a href="ifna.html">IFNA function</a> in Excel 2013 or later to only catch #N/A errors.
<h2>ISERROR</h2>
This example illustrates the <k>ISERROR function</k> in <k>Excel</k>.

1. For example, Excel displays the #DIV/0! error when a formula tries to divide a number by 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iserror/div-error.png">

2. The ISERROR function in Excel checks whether a value is an error and returns TRUE or FALSE.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iserror/iserror-function.png">

3. Add the IF function.
If a cell contains an error, the value 5 is returned.
If not, the value 100 is returned.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iserror/if-iserror.png" loading="lazy">

4. Use the <a href="iferror.html">IFERROR function</a> to return the result of a formula (if there's no error) or an alternative result, such as text (if there's an error).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iserror/iferror-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. Use COUNT, IF and ISERROR to count the total number of errors in a range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/iserror/count-errors.png" loading="lazy">
Note: finish an array formula by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Excel adds the curly braces {}.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Visit our page about <a href="count-errors.html">Counting Errors</a> for detailed instructions on how to create this array formula.
<h2>AGGREGATE</h2>
<k>Excel</k> functions such as SUM, COUNT, LARGE and MAX don't work if a range includes errors.
However, you can easily use the <k>AGGREGATE function</k> to fix this.

1. For example, Excel returns an error if you use the SUM function to sum a range with errors.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/aggregate/without-aggregate-function.png">

2. Use the AGGREGATE function to sum a range with errors.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/aggregate/aggregate-function.png">
Explanation: the first argument (9) tells Excel that you want to use the SUM function.
The second argument (6) tells Excel that you want to ignore error values.

3. It's not easy to remember which argument belongs to which function.
Fortunately, the AutoComplete feature in Excel helps you with this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/aggregate/autocomplete-feature.png" loading="lazy">

4. The AGGREGATE function below finds the second largest number in a range with errors.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/aggregate/aggregate-large-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the first argument (14) tells Excel that you want to use the LARGE function.
The second argument (6) tells Excel that you want to ignore error values.
The fourth argument (2) tells Excel that you want to find the second largest number.

5. The AGGREGATE function below finds the maximum value ignoring error values and hidden rows.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/aggregate/ignore-error-values-hidden-rows.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the first argument (4) tells Excel that you want to use the MAX function.
The second argument (7) tells Excel that you want to ignore error values and hidden rows.
In this example, row 2 is hidden.
<h2>Circular Reference</h2>
<a href="#direct-circular-reference">Direct Circular Reference</a>  |  <a href="#indirect-circular-reference">Indirect Circular Reference</a>  |  <a href="#find-circular-references">Find Circular References</a>
A <k>circular reference in Excel</k> occurs when a formula directly or indirectly refers to its own cell.
This is not possible.
<h3>Direct Circular Reference</h3>
Let's start simple.
A direct circular reference in Excel occurs when a formula directly refers to its own cell.

1. For example, the formula in cell A3 below directly refers to its own cell (A3).
This is not possible.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/direct-circular-reference.png">

2. Press Enter.
The circular reference error message appears.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/circular-reference-error-message.png">

3. Click OK.
Excel returns a 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/accept-direct-circular-reference.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Indirect Circular Reference</h3>
An indirect circular reference in Excel occurs when a formula indirectly refers to its own cell.
Let's look at a simple example.

1. For example, cell D2 below contains the value 25. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/cell-d2.png" loading="lazy">

2. Cell F4 refers to cell D2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/relative-reference-1.png" loading="lazy">

3. Cell C5 refers to cell F4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/relative-reference-2.png" loading="lazy">

4. So far, everything's OK.
Now replace the value 25 in cell D2 with the formula shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/create-indirect-circular-reference.png" loading="lazy">

5. Press Enter.
The circular reference error message appears.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/circular-reference-error-message.png" loading="lazy">

6. Click OK.
Excel returns a 0. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/indirect-circular-reference.png" loading="lazy">

7. On the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing group, click Show Formulas.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/show-formulas.png" loading="lazy">

8. Cell D2 refers to cell C5. Cell C5 refers to cell F4. Cell F4 refers back to cell D2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/circle.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: the formula in cell D2 indirectly refers to its own cell (D2).
This is not possible.
The formulas in cell C5 and cell F4 also refer back to their own cell (it's a circle).
<h3>Find Circular References</h3>
To <k>find circular references</k> in Excel, in the Formula Auditing group, click the down arrow next to Error Checking and click Cell References.

1. Our sheet contains 2 circular references.

1 direct circular reference (A3) and 1 indirect circular reference (D2, C5 and F4).

6. On the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing group, click the down arrow next to Error Checking.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/error-checking.png" loading="lazy">

7. Click Circular References.
Excel shows the cell addresses of the indirect circular reference.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/multiple-cell-addresses.png" loading="lazy">

8. The status bar only displays a single cell address.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/circular-reference/single-cell-address.png" loading="lazy">
Note: fix this circular reference by replacing one of the formulas with a value.
As a result, the warning in the status bar will disappear.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/formula-auditing/evaluate-formula-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Floating Point Errors</h2>
<k>Excel</k> stores and calculates floating point numbers.
Sometimes, the result of a formula is a very close approximation.

1. For example, take a look at the formulas below.
At first glance, everything looks alright.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/floating-point-errors/formula-results.png">

2. However, if we show 16 decimal places, we can see that one result is a very close approximation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/floating-point-errors/floating-point-error.png">
You don't have to worry about <k>floating point errors</k>.
They are rare.

3. Even if your worksheet contains a floating point error, in most cases, this causes no problems.
However, if you compare the value in cell C8 with another value, the following problem can occur.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/floating-point-errors/if-function.png" loading="lazy">

4. Use the ROUND function to fix this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/floating-point-errors/round-function.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>IFNA</h2>
Use the <k>IFNA function in Excel</k> to replace a #N/A error with a friendly message.
The IFNA function only catches #N/A errors.

1. For example, Excel returns the #N/A error when the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> cannot find a match.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifna/na-error.png">

2. Use the IFNA function to replace the #N/A error with a friendly message.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifna/ifna-function.png">

3. If the VLOOKUP function does not evaluate to a #N/A error, the IFNA function simply returns the result of the VLOOKUP function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifna/vlookup-result.png" loading="lazy">                        
The IFNA function was introduced in Excel 2013. If you're using Excel 2010 or Excel 2007, combine IF and ISNA (step 5) or use IFERROR (step 6).

4. First, the ISNA function checks whether a value is #N/A, and returns TRUE or FALSE.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifna/isna-function.png" loading="lazy">

5. Combine IF and ISNA.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifna/if-isna.png" loading="lazy">

6. The previous formula is quite long.
You can also use the IFERROR function in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/ifna/iferror-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the <a href="iferror.html">IFERROR function</a> catches other errors as well.
For example, the #NAME? error if you accidentally misspell the word VLOOKUP.<h2>Count Errors</h2>
This example shows you how to create an array formula that <k>counts</k> the number of <k>errors</k> in a range.

1. We use IF and ISERROR to check for an error.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-errors/if-iserror-function.png">
Explanation: the IF function returns 1, if an error is found.
If not, it returns an empty string.

2. To count the errors (don't be overwhelmed), we add the COUNT function and replace A1 with A1:C3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-errors/array-formula.png">

3. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-errors/count-errors-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the IF function is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{1,"",1;"","","";"","",1}
This array constant is used as an argument for the COUNT function, giving a result of 3. 

4. To count specific errors, use the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a>.
For example, count the number of cells that contain the #DIV/0! error.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-errors/count-div-errors.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Count Unique Values</h2>
This example shows you how to create an array formula that <k>counts unique values</k>.

1. We use the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a>.
For example, to count the number of 5's, use the following function.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-unique-values/countif-function.png">

2. To count the unique values (don't be overwhelmed), we add the SUM function, 1/, and replace 5 with A1:A6.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-unique-values/count-unique-values-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: The formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
Explanation: The range (array constant) created by the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a> is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{3;1;1;1;3;3} - (three 7's, one sun, one moon, one 5, three 7's, three 7's)
This reduces to:

{1/3;1/1;1/1;1/1;1/3;1/3}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 1/3+1+1+1+1/3+1/3 = 4. 

4. The array formula below counts the number of values that occur exactly once.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-unique-values/exactly-once.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the IF function converts the array constant {3;1;1;1;3;3} to {0;1;1;1;0;0}.
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 3. 

5. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply use the magic UNIQUE function to extract unique values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-unique-values/unique-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell C3, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

6. Next, add the COUNTA function to count unique values in Excel 365/2021. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-unique-values/counta-unique.png" loading="lazy">

7. The formula below counts the number of values that occur exactly once.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-unique-values/count-values-that-occur-exactly-once.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the UNIQUE function has 2 optional arguments.
The default value of 0 (second argument) tells the UNIQUE function to extract values from a vertical array.
The value 1 (third argument) tells the UNIQUE function to extract values that occur exactly once.
<h2>Count with Or Criteria</h2>
<k>Counting</k> with <k>Or criteria</k> in <k>Excel</k> can be tricky.
This article shows several easy to follow examples.

1. We start simple.
For example, we want to count the number of cells that contain Google or Facebook (one column).<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-with-or-criteria/2x-countif-function.png">

2a.
However, if we want to count the number of rows that contain Google <u>or</u> Stanford (two columns), we cannot simply use the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a> twice (see the picture below).
Rows that contain Google and Stanford are counted twice, but they should only be counted once.

4 is the answer we are looking for.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-with-or-criteria/wrong-formula.png">

2b.
What we need is an array formula.
We use the IF function to check if Google <u>or</u> Stanford occurs.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-with-or-criteria/count-rows-with-or-criteria-step-1.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0. For row 1, the IF function evaluates to IF(TRUE+TRUE,1,0), IF(2,1,0), 1. So the first row will be counted.
For row 2, the IF function evaluates to IF(FALSE+FALSE,1,0), IF(0,1,0), 0. So the second row will not be counted.For row 3, the IF function evaluates to IF(FALSE+TRUE,1,0), IF(1,1,0), 1. So the third row will be counted, etc.
2c.
All we need is a SUM function that counts these 1's.
To achieve this (don't be overwhelmed), we add the SUM function and replace A1 with A1:A8 and B1 with B1:B8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-with-or-criteria/count-rows-with-or-criteria-step-2.png" loading="lazy">

2d.
Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-with-or-criteria/count-rows-with-or-criteria-step-3.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the IF function is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{1;0;1;0;1;0;1;0}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 4. 

3. We can go one step further.
For example, we want to count the number of rows that contain (Google <u>and</u> Stanford) <u>or</u> Columbia.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/count-with-or-criteria/count-rows-with-and-or-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Sum Every nth Row</h2>
This example shows you how to create an array formula<k> that sums every nth row in Excel</k>.
We will show it for n = 3, but you can do this for any number.

1. The <a href="row-function.html">ROW function</a> returns the row number of a cell.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-every-nth-row/row-function.png">

2. The <a href="mod.html">MOD function</a> gives the remainder of a division.
For example, for the first row, MOD(1,3) = 1 because 1 divided by 3 equals 0 with a remainder 1. For the third row, MOD(3,3) = 0 because 3 divided by 3 equals 1 with a remainder of 0. As a result, the formula returns 0 for every 3rd row.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-every-nth-row/mod-function.png">
Note: change the 3 to 4 to sum every 4th row, to 5 to sum every 5th row, etc.

3. Slightly change the formula as shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-every-nth-row/true-false.png" loading="lazy">

4. To get the sum of the product of these two ranges (FALSE=0, TRUE=1), use the SUM function and finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-every-nth-row/sum-every-nth-row-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the product of these two ranges (array constant) is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows.
{0;0;5;0;0;66;0;0;21}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 92. 
<h2>Sum Largest Numbers</h2>
This example shows you how to create an array formula that <k>sums</k> the <k>largest numbers</k> in a range.

1. We use the LARGE function.
For example, to find the second largest number, use the following function.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-largest-numbers/large-function.png">

2. To sum the 4 largest numbers (don't be overwhelmed), add the SUM function and replace 2 with {1,2,3,4}.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-largest-numbers/array-formula.png">

3. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-largest-numbers/sum-largest-numbers-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the LARGE function is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows.
{22,10,8,6}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 46. 
<h2>Sum Range with Errors</h2>
This example shows you how to create an array formula that <k>sums</k> a <k>range with errors</k>.
You can also use the <a href="aggregate.html">AGGREGATE function</a> to sum a range with errors.

1. We use the IFERROR function to check for an error.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-range-with-errors/iferror-function.png">
Explanation: the IFERROR function returns 0, if an error is found.
If not, it returns the value of the cell.

2. To sum the range with errors (don't be overwhelmed), we add the SUM function and replace A1 with A1:A7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-range-with-errors/array-formula.png">

3. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-range-with-errors/sum-range-with-errors-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the IFERROR function is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{0;5;4;0;0;1;3}
This array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 13. 
<h2>Sum with Or Criteria</h2>
<k>Summing</k> with <k>Or criteria</k> in <k>Excel</k> can be tricky.
This article shows several easy to follow examples.

1. We start simple.
For example, we want to sum the cells that meet the following criteria: Google or Facebook (one criteria range).<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-with-or-criteria/2x-sumif-function.png">

2a.
However, if we want to sum the cells that meet the following criteria: Google <u>or</u> Stanford (two criteria ranges), we cannot simply use the <a href="sumif.html">SUMIF function</a> twice (see the picture below).
Cells that meet the criteria Google and Stanford are added twice, but they should only be added once.

10 is the answer we are looking for.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-with-or-criteria/wrong-formula.png">

2b.
We need an array formula.
We use the <a href="if.html">IF function</a> to check if Google <u>or</u> Stanford occurs.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-with-or-criteria/sum-rows-with-or-criteria-step-1.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0. For row 1, the IF function evaluates to IF(TRUE+TRUE,1,0)*3, IF(2,1,0)*3, 3. So the value 3 will be added.
For row 2, the IF function evaluates to IF(FALSE+FALSE,1,0)*5, IF(0,1,0)*5, 0. So the value 5 will not be added.For row 3, the IF function evaluates to IF(FALSE+TRUE,1,0)*2, IF(1,1,0)*2, 2. So the value 2 will be added, etc.
2c.
All we need is a SUM function that sums these values.
To achieve this (don't be overwhelmed), we add the SUM function and replace A1 with A1:A8, B1 with B1:B8 and C1 with C1:C8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-with-or-criteria/sum-rows-with-or-criteria-step-2.png" loading="lazy">

2d.
Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-with-or-criteria/sum-rows-with-or-criteria-step-3.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the IF function is stored in <k>Excel's</k> memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{1;0;1;0;1;0;1;0}
multiplied by C1:C8 this yields:
{3;0;2;0;4;0;1;0}
This latter array constant is used as an argument for the SUM function, giving a result of 10. 

3. We can go one step further.
For example, we want to sum the cells that meet the following criteria: (Google <u>and</u> Stanford) <u>or</u> Columbia.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sum-with-or-criteria/sum-rows-with-and-or-criteria.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Most Frequently Occurring Word</h2>
This example teaches you how to find the <k>most frequently occurring word</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
You can use the <a href="mode.html">MODE function</a> to find the most frequently occurring number.
However, the MODE function only works with numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/most-frequently-occurring-word/most-frequently-occurring-number.png">
You can use the <a href="countif.html">COUNTIF function</a> to count the number of occurrences of each word.
However, we are looking for a single formula that returns the most frequently occurring word (circle in our example).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/most-frequently-occurring-word/countif-function.png">
To find the most frequently occurring word, execute the following steps.

1. The MATCH function returns the position of a value in a given range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/most-frequently-occurring-word/match-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: circle (A7) found at position 2 in the range A1:A7. Set the third argument to 0 to return an exact match.

2. To find the position of the most frequently occurring word (don't be overwhelmed), we add the MODE function and replace A7 with A1:A7. 

3. Finish by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/most-frequently-occurring-word/mode-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the formula bar indicates that this is an array formula by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
Do not type these yourself.
They will disappear when you edit the formula.
In Excel 365 or Excel 2021, finish by simply pressing Enter.
You won't see curly braces.
Explanation: the range (array constant) created by the MATCH function is stored in Excel's memory, not in a range.
The array constant looks as follows:
{1;2;2;2;5;5;2} - (triangle found at position 1, circle found at position 2, circle found at position 2, etc.)
This array constant is used as an argument for the MODE function, giving a result of 2 (the position of the most frequently occurring word).

4. Use this result and the INDEX function to return the 2nd word in the range A1:A7, the most frequently occurring word.

<h2>Dynamic Arrays</h2>
<a href="#formula-example">Formula Example</a>  |  <a href="#dynamic-array-functions">Dynamic Array Functions</a>  |  <a href="#old-array-formulas">Old Array Formulas</a>  |  <a href="#spill-range">Spill Range</a>
<k>Dynamic array formulas</k>, entered into a single cell, fill multiple cells.
This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called spilling.
<h3>Formula Example</h3>
Let's start with an easy example.

1. Fix the reference to cell E2 by placing a $ symbol in front of the column letter and row number.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/absolute-reference.png">

2. To quickly copy the formula in cell C2 to the other cells, select cell C2, click on the lower right corner of cell C2 and drag it down to cell C7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/copy-formula.png">
Check:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/traditional-excel-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the absolute reference ($E$2) stays the same, while the relative reference (B2) changes to B3, B4, B5, B6 and B7. 

3. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply enter the dynamic array formula shown below into cell C2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/dynamic-array-formula.png" loading="lazy">

4. Press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/blue-border.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: this dynamic array (DA) formula, entered into cell C2, fills multiple cells.
This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called spilling.
If you select a cell in the range C2:C7, a blue border appears.

5. If you select a cell in the range C3:C7, the formula in the formula bar will be greyed out.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/formula-greyed-out.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Dynamic Array Functions</h3>
<k>Excel 365 and Excel 2021</k> offer many new <k>dynamic array functions</k>.
Follow the links below to learn more about these functions.

1. The <a href="sort-function.html">SORT function</a> below sorts by the second column, in ascending order.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/sort-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell F2, fills multiple cells.
Wow!

2. The <a href="filter-function.html">FILTER function</a> below extracts all USA records.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/filter-function.png" loading="lazy">

3. The <a href="random-numbers.html#randarray">RANDARRAY function</a> below generates random decimal numbers between 0 and 1. The array below consists of 5 rows and 2 columns.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/randarray-function.png" loading="lazy">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/unique-function.png" loading="lazy">

6. The <a href="xlookup.html">XLOOKUP function</a> below looks up the ID and returns the first name, last name and salary.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/xlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: if you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, use <a href="xlookup.html">XLOOKUP</a> instead of VLOOKUP.
The XLOOKUP function is easier to use and has some additional advantages.

7. The SORTBY function sorts a range based on the values in a corresponding range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/sortby-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 1 to sort in ascending order, use -1 to sort in descending order.
<h3>Old Array Formulas</h3>
Old <a href="../functions/array-formulas.html">array formulas</a> still work.
The good news is, if you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, you don't have to press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER anymore.
Below you can find a few examples.

1. A traditional array formula finished by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/cse-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: this formula <a href="sum-largest-numbers.html">sums the 4 largest numbers</a>.

2. The same formula in Excel 365/2021 finished by simply pressing Enter.
Bye bye curly braces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/bye-bye-curly-braces.png" loading="lazy">

3. A traditional TRANSPOSE function entered by preselecting the range E2:E4 and finished by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/old-transpose-function.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="transpose.html#transpose-function">TRANSPOSE function</a> converts a horizontal range to a vertical range, or vice versa.

4. The same function in Excel 365/2021, entered into a single cell, spills to neighboring cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/function-spills-to-neighboring-cells.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Spill Range</h3>
To refer to the values inside the blue rectangle, also called the spill range, always use the first cell and a hash character.

1. For example, the <a href="unique-values.html#unique-function">UNIQUE function</a> below, entered into cell C1, extracts unique values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/unique-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. The COUNTA function below uses the spill range (C1#) to count unique values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/spill-range.png" loading="lazy">

3. If something is blocking the spill range, Excel displays the #SPILL! error.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/dynamic-arrays/spill-error.png" loading="lazy">
Note: in this example, simply empty cell C6 to fix the #SPILL error.
<h2>LET function</h2>
<a href="#simple-let-function">Simple LET function</a>  |  <a href="#advanced-let-function">Advanced LET function</a>
Use the <k>LET function</k> in <k>Excel 365/2021</k> to declare variables and assign values (or calculation results) to variables.
Next, use these variables in a calculation.
<h3>Simple LET function</h3>
Let's start with an easy example.

1. The simple LET function below declares variable x (and assigns the value 2) and declares variable y (and assigns the value 5).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/let-variables.png">
Note: the LET function can handle up to 126 variable/value pairs.

2. The final argument of the LET function is always a calculation.
In this example, x+y reduces to 2+5=7. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/simple-let-function.png">
<h3>Advanced LET function</h3>
Why using the <k>LET function in Excel</k>? The LET function can make your formulas easier to read.
Let's take a look at a cool example.

1. The VLOOKUP function below returns the sales of ID 14. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/vlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> to learn more about this Excel function.

2. The formula below calculates a bonus (10 percent of every dollar above $5,000).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/bonus-calculation.png" loading="lazy">

3. To write a single formula, simply replace H3 with the VLOOKUP function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/single-formula.png" loading="lazy">
This IF formula is quite difficult to read.
Simply use the LET function to make it easier to read.

4. The LET function below declares the variable Sales and assigns a calculation result!
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/calculation-result.png" loading="lazy">

5. Next, use the variable Sales in a final calculation.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/let-function/advanced-let-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the IF formula is now easier to understand.
This LET function has only 1 variable/value pair.

For example, download the <a href="excel-files/array-manipulation.xlsx">Excel file</a> and try to return the 2nd column from this array.Practice makes perfect!
<h2>LAMBDA</h2>
Use <k>LAMBDA</k> and the Name Manager in <k>Excel</k> to create your own Excel function.
You can use this custom function like any other Excel function!
Suppose we want to create a custom function called MYFUNCTION that multiplies two values, and then adds 1 to the result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/lambda/use-lambda-to-create-your-own-excel-function.png">
To create this function, execute the following steps.

1. On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Define Name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/lambda/define-name.png">

2. Give your function a name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/lambda/name-your-function.png">

3. Use LAMBDA to create your function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/lambda/lambda-function.png">
Explanation: first specify the input arguments (x and y).
Finish with a calculation to define the output of the function (x*y+1).

4. A <k>LAMBDA function</k> works like any other Excel function.
For example, double click the lower right corner of cell C1 to quickly copy this function to the other cells.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/lambda/custom-excel-function.png">
Note: if you like, you can use different argument names.
In this example, =LAMBDA(a,b,a*b+1) produces the exact same result! The LAMBDA function is only available in Excel 365 or Excel 2021.

<h2>Reverse List</h2>
This article teaches you how to <k>reverse the order of a list in Excel</k>.
For example, we want to reverse the list in column A below.
1. Enter the value 1 into cell B1 and the value 2 into cell B2. 

2. Select the range B1:B2, click the lower right corner of this range, and drag it down to cell B8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/add-list.png">

3. Click any number in the list in column B.

4. To sort in descending order, on the Data tab, in the Sort &amp; Filter group, click ZA.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/sort-descending-order.png">
Result.
Not only the list in column B, but also the list in column A has been reversed.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/reversed-list.png" loading="lazy">
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, use SEQUENCE, SORTBY and ROWS to sort a list in <k>reverse order</k>.
The following formula is pretty awesome.

5. First, use the SEQUENCE function to generate a list of numbers.
The SEQUENCE function below has 4 arguments.
Rows = 8, Columns = 1, Start = 1, Step = 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/sequence-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the SEQUENCE function, entered into cell B1, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

6. The SORTBY function sorts a range based on the values in a corresponding range.
Use -1 (third argument) to sort in descending order.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/sortby-function.png" loading="lazy">

7. Nest the SEQUENCE function inside the SORTBY function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/sortby-and-sequence.png" loading="lazy">

8. If you have a longer list of say 20 names, change the value 8 to 20 in the formula shown above, or even better, use the ROWS function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/reverse-list/reverse-order.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the ROWS function simply counts the number of rows in a range.
<h2>Randomize List</h2>
This article teaches you how to <k>randomize</k> (shuffle) a list in Excel.
For example, we want to randomize the list in column A below.
1. Select cell B1 and insert the RAND() function.

2. Click on the lower right corner of cell B1 and drag it down to cell B8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/add-random-numbers.png">

3. Click any number in the list in column B.

4. To sort in descending order, on the Data tab, in the Sort &amp; Filter group, click ZA.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/sort-descending-order.png">
Result.
A random list in column A (sorted on the random numbers above).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/random-list.png" loading="lazy">
Note: <a href="random-numbers.html">random numbers</a> change every time a cell on the sheet is calculated.
If you don't want this, simply copy the random numbers and paste them as values.
If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, use RANDARRAY, SORTBY and ROWS to <k>randomize a list in Excel</k>.
The following formula is pretty awesome.

5. First, use the RANDARRAY function to generate a list of random decimal numbers between 0 and 1. The array below consists of 8 rows and 1 column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/randarray-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the RANDARRAY function, entered into cell B1, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

6. The SORTBY function sorts a range based on the values in a corresponding range.
By default, the SORTBY function sorts in ascending order.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/sortby-function.png" loading="lazy">

7. Nest the RANDARRAY function inside the SORTBY function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/sortby-and-randarray.png" loading="lazy">

8. If you have a longer list of say 20 names, change the value 8 to 20 in the formula shown above, or even better, use the ROWS function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/randomize-list/random-sort.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the ROWS function simply counts the number of rows in a range.
<h2>SORT function</h2>
Use the magic <k>SORT function in Excel 365/2021</k> to sort your Excel data on one column or multiple columns.
Let's give it a try.

1. The simple SORT function below has only 1 argument (A2:D15).
By default, the SORT function sorts by the first column, in ascending order.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sort-function/simple-sort-function.png">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell F2, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

2. Use the second argument of the SORT function to sort by a different column.
The SORT function below sorts by the second column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sort-function/sort-by-different-column.png">
Note: only edit the formula in cell F2. Excel will do the rest.

3. Use the third argument of the SORT function to sort in a different order.
The SORT function below sorts by the first column, in descending order.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sort-function/sort-in-descending-order.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 1 to sort in ascending order, use -1 to sort in descending order.

4. To sort on multiple columns, simply supply an array constant.
For example, sort by Last Name first and Sales second.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sort-function/sort-on-multiple-columns.png" loading="lazy">

5. The <k>advanced SORT function</k> below sorts by Last Name first (in ascending order) and by Sales second (in descending order).
Pretty cool, huh?
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sort-function/advanced-sort-function.png" loading="lazy">

6. Finally, use the SORTBY function in Excel to sort a range based on the values in a corresponding range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sort-function/sortby-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: use 1 to sort in ascending order, use -1 to sort in descending order.

<h2>SUBTOTAL</h2>
<a href="#rows-hidden-by-a-filter">Rows Hidden by a Filter</a>  |  <a href="#manually-hidden-rows">Manually Hidden Rows</a>  |  <a href="#automatic-subtotals">Automatic Subtotals</a>
Use the <k>SUBTOTAL function</k> in <k>Excel</k> (instead of SUM, COUNT, MAX, etc.) to ignore rows hidden by a filter or to ignore manually hidden rows.
<h3>Rows Hidden by a Filter</h3>

1. For example, the SUM function below calculates the total sales.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/sum-function.png">

2. Apply a filter.

3. The SUM function includes rows hidden by a filter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/rows-hidden-by-a-filter-included.png">

4. The SUBTOTAL function ignores rows hidden by a filter and calculates the correct result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/subtotal-function-ignores-rows-hidden-by-a-filter.png" loading="lazy">
Note: 109 is the argument for Sum if you use the SUBTOTAL function.

5. It's not easy to remember which argument belongs to which function.
Fortunately, the AutoComplete feature in Excel helps you with this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/first-argument-subtotal-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: instead of using 101 (AVERAGE) for the first argument, you could also use 1 (AVERAGE), instead of using 102 (COUNT), you could also use 2 (COUNT), etc.
When filtering data, there's no difference between the numbers 101-111 and the numbers 1-11. 
<h3>Manually Hidden Rows</h3>

1. For example, the SUM function below sums a range of cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/basic-function.png" loading="lazy">

2. <a href="hide-columns-rows.html#hide">Hide</a> row 2. 

3. The SUM function includes manually hidden rows.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/manually-hidden-rows-included.png" loading="lazy">

4. The SUBTOTAL function ignores manually hidden rows and calculates the correct result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/subtotal-function-ignores-manually-hidden-rows.png" loading="lazy">
Caution: the numbers 101-111 ignore manually hidden rows.
However, the numbers 1-11 include manually hidden rows!
<h3>Automatic Subtotals</h3>
We saved the best for last.
Excel can automatically add SUBTOTAL functions for you.

1. The first option.
<a href="../data-analysis/tables.html#create-table">Create a table</a> and add a <a href="../data-analysis/tables.html#total-row">total row</a> to the bottom of the table.
Next, click any cell in the last row to automatically add a SUBTOTAL function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/table-total-row-subtotal.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: in this example, we also filtered by Country.
Excel uses the SUBTOTAL function to correctly calculate the total sales in the USA.

2. The second option.
On the Data tab, in the Outline group, click Subtotal to <a href="outlining-data.html">outline your data</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/subtotal/data-tab-outline-group-subtotal.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: in this example, Excel automatically added 5 SUBTOTAL functions (B6, B9, B13, B19 and B20).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/unique-values/unique-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell C1, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

2. The UNIQUE function below extracts values that occur exactly once.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/unique-values/values-that-occur-exactly-once.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the UNIQUE function has 2 optional arguments.
The default value of 0 (second argument) tells the UNIQUE function to extract values from a vertical array.
The value 1 (third argument) tells the UNIQUE function to extract values that occur exactly once.
<h3>Remove Duplicates</h3>
To <k>find unique values</k> (or unique rows) <u>and</u> delete duplicate values (or duplicate rows) at the same time, use the <a href="remove-duplicates.html">Remove Duplicates</a> tool in Excel.

<h2>FILTER function</h2>
Use the magic <k>FILTER function in Excel 365/2021</k> to extract records that meet certain criteria.
The FILTER function is quite versatile.

1. The simple FILTER function below has two arguments and extracts all USA records.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/filter-function/simple-filter-function.png">
Note: this dynamic array function, entered into cell F2, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.

2. The dynamic FILTER function below extracts all UK records.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/filter-function/dynamic-filter-function.png">

3. The FILTER function has an optional third argument.
Use this argument to display a friendly message (instead of the #CALC! error) if no records are found.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/filter-function/no-records-found.png" loading="lazy">

4. Let's kick it up a notch! The <k>FILTER function</k> below uses the multiplication operator (*) to extract all records where Sales is greater than $10,000 <u>and</u> Country equals "USA".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/filter-function/and-criteria.png" loading="lazy">

5. The FILTER function below uses the addition operator (+) to extract all records where Last Name equals "Smith" <u>or</u> Last Name equals "Brown".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/filter-function/or-criteria.png" loading="lazy">

6. Add the <a href="sort-function.html">SORT function</a> to sort the records by the first column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/filter-function/sort-and-filter.png" loading="lazy">

Note: select Unique from the first drop-down list to highlight the unique names.
<h3>Triplicates</h3>
By default, Excel highlights duplicates (Juliet, Delta), triplicates (Sierra), etc.
(see previous image).
Execute the following steps to highlight triplicates only.

1. First, <a href="../data-analysis/conditional-formatting.html#clear-rules">clear</a> the previous conditional formatting rule.

2. Select the range A1:C10. 

3. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/click-conditional-formatting.png" loading="lazy">

4. Click New Rule.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/new-rule.png" loading="lazy">

5. Select 'Use a formula to determine which cells to format'.

6. Enter the formula =<a href="countif.html">COUNTIF</a>($A$1:$C$10,A1)=3

7. Select a formatting style and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/new-formatting-rule.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
Excel highlights the triplicate names.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/triplicates.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: =<a href="countif.html">COUNTIF</a>($A$1:$C$10,A1) counts the number of names in the range A1:C10 that are equal to the name in cell A1. If COUNTIF($A$1:$C$10,A1) = 3, Excel formats cell A1. Always write the formula for the upper-left cell in the selected range (A1:C10).
Excel automatically copies the formula to the other cells.
Thus, cell A2 contains the formula =COUNTIF($A$1:$C$10,A2)=3, cell A3 =COUNTIF($A$1:$C$10,A3)=3, etc.
Notice how we created an <a href="absolute-reference.html">absolute reference</a> ($A$1:$C$10) to fix this reference.
Note: you can use any formula you like.
For example, use this formula =COUNTIF($A$1:$C$10,A1)>3 to highlight names that occur more than 3 times.<h3>Duplicate Rows</h3>
To find and highlight duplicate rows in Excel, use COUNTIFS (with the letter S at the end) instead of COUNTIF.

1. Select the range A1:C10. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/find-duplicate-rows.png" loading="lazy">

2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting.

4. Select 'Use a formula to determine which cells to format'.

5. Enter the formula =COUNTIFS(Animals,$A1,Continents,$B1,Countries,$C1)>1

6. Select a formatting style and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/highlight-duplicate-rows.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the <a href="named-range.html">named range</a> Animals refers to the range A1:A10, the named range Continents refers to the range B1:B10 and the named range Countries refers to the range C1:C10. =COUNTIFS(Animals,$A1,Continents,$B1,Countries,$C1) counts the number of rows based on multiple criteria (Leopard, Africa, Zambia).
Result.
Excel highlights the duplicate rows.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/duplicate-rows.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: if COUNTIFS(Animals,$A1,Continents,$B1,Countries,$C1) > 1, in other words, if there are multiple (Leopard, Africa, Zambia) rows, Excel formats cell A1. Always write the formula for the upper-left cell in the selected range (A1:C10).
Excel automatically copies the formula to the other cells.
We fixed the <a href="../functions/cell-references.html">reference</a> to each column by placing a $ symbol in front of the column letter ($A1, $B1 and $C1).
As a result, cell A1, B1 and C1 contain the same formula, cell A2, B2 and C2 contain the formula =COUNTIFS(Animals,$A2,Continents,$B2,Countries,$C2)>1, etc.

7. Finally, you can use the <a href="remove-duplicates.html">Remove Duplicates</a> tool in Excel to quickly remove duplicate rows.
On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Remove Duplicates.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/find-duplicates/click-remove-duplicates.png" loading="lazy">
In the example below, Excel removes all identical rows (blue) except for the first identical row found (yellow).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/shade-alternate-rows/shade-alternate-rows-result.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the <a href="mod.html">MOD function</a> gives the remainder of a division.
The <a href="row-function.html">ROW function</a> returns the row number of a cell.
For example, for the seventh row, MOD(7,2) = 1 because 7 divided by 2 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. For the eight row, MOD(8,2) = 0 because 8 divided by 2 equals 4 with a remainder of 0. As a result, all cells in even rows return 0 and will be shaded.<h3>Apply a Table Style</h3>

<h2>Compare Two Lists</h2>
This example describes how to <k>compare two lists</k> using conditional formatting.
For example, you may have two lists of NFL teams.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-lists/compare-two-lists-example.png">
To highlight the teams in the <k>first list</k> that are not in the <k>second list</k>, execute the following steps.

1. First, select the range A1:A18 and <a href="named-range.html">name</a> it firstList, select the range B1:B20 and name it secondList.

2. Next, select the range A1:A18. 

3. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-lists/click-conditional-formatting.png">

4. Click New Rule.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-lists/new-rule.png" loading="lazy">

5. Select 'Use a formula to determine which cells to format'.

6. Enter the formula =<a href="countif.html">COUNTIF</a>(secondList,A1)=0

7. Select a formatting style and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-lists/use-a-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
Miami Dolphins and Tennessee Titans are not in the second list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/compare-two-lists/first-list-result.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: =<a href="countif.html">COUNTIF</a>(secondList,A1) counts the number of teams in secondList that are equal to the team in cell A1. If COUNTIF(secondList,A1) = 0, the team in cell A1 is not in the second list.
As a result, <k>Excel</k> fills the cell with a blue background color.
Always write the formula for the upper-left cell in the selected range (A1:A18).
Excel automatically copies the formula to the other cells.
Thus, cell A2 contains the formula =COUNTIF(secondList,A2)=0, cell A3  =COUNTIF(secondList,A3)=0, etc.

8. To highlight the teams in the second list that are not in the first list, select the range B1:B20, create a new rule using the formula =COUNTIF(firstList,B1)=0, and set the format to orange fill.
Result.
Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers are not in the first list.

<h2>Conflicting Rules</h2>
Sometimes <k>multiple conditional formatting rules</k> in <k>Excel</k> <k>conflict</k>.
A higher rule always wins.
This example illustrates two different results.

1. The value 95 is higher than 80 but is also the highest value (Top 1).
The formats (yellow fill vs green fill and yellow text color vs green text color) conflict.
A higher rule always wins.
As a result, the value 95 is colored yellow.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/conflicting-rules/conflicting-conditional-formatting-rules-1.png">

2. Move the second rule up.
The value 95 is the highest value (Top 1) but is also higher than 80. The formats (green fill vs yellow fill and green text color vs yellow text color) conflict.
A higher rule always wins.
As a result, the value 95 is colored green.

Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/trendline/trendline.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: Excel uses the method of least squares to find a line that best fits the points.
The R-squared value equals 0.9295, which is a good fit.
The closer to 1, the better the line fits the data.
The trendline predicts 120 sold Wonka bars in period 13. You can verify this by using the equation.
y = 7.7515 * 13 + 18.267 = 119.0365. 

6. Instead of using this equation, you can use the FORECAST.LINEAR function in Excel.
This function predicts the same future values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/trendline/linear-trend.png" loading="lazy">

7. The FORECAST.ETS function in Excel predicts a future value using Exponential Triple Smoothing, which takes into account seasonality.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/trendline/seasonal-pattern.png" loading="lazy">
Tip: visit our page about <a href="forecast.html">forecasting</a> to learn more about these functions.

<h2>Pareto Chart</h2>
<a href="#excel-2016-or-later">Excel 2016 or later</a>  |  <a href="#all-versions">All Versions</a>
This example teaches you how to create a <k>Pareto chart in Excel</k>.
The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
In this example, we will see that roughly 80% of the complaints come from 20% of the complaint types.
<h3>Excel 2016 or later</h3>
To create a Pareto chart in Excel 2016 or later, execute the following steps.

1. Select the range A3:B13.

Conclusion: the orange Pareto line shows that (789 + 621) / 1722 ≈ 80% of the complaints come from 2 out of 10 = 20% of the complaint types (Overpriced and Small portions).
In other words: the Pareto principle applies.
<h3>All Versions</h3>
If you don't have Excel 2016 or later, simply create a Pareto chart by combining a column chart and a line graph.
This method works with all versions of Excel.

1. First, select a number in column B.

<h2>GETPIVOTDATA</h2>
To quickly enter a <k>GETPIVOTDATA function</k> in <k>Excel</k>, type an equal sign (=) and click a cell in a <a href="../data-analysis/pivot-tables.html">pivot table</a>.
The GETPIVOTDATA function can be quite useful.

1. First, select cell B14 below and type =D7 (without clicking cell D7 in the pivot table) to reference the amount of beans exported to France.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/cell-reference.png">

2. Use the filter to only show the amounts of vegetables exported to each country.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/static-reference.png">
Note: cell B14 now references the amount of carrots exported to France, not the amount of beans.
GETPIVOTDATA to the rescue!

3. Remove the filter.
Select cell B14 again, type an equal sign (=) and click cell D7 in the pivot table.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/getpivotdata-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel automatically inserts the GETPIVOTDATA function shown above.

4. Again, use the filter to only show the amounts of vegetables exported to each country.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/dynamic-reference.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the GETPIVOTDATA function correctly returns the amount of beans exported to France.

5. The GETPIVOTDATA function can only return data that is visible.
For example, use the filter to only show the amounts of fruit exported to each country.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/ref-error.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the GETPIVOTDATA function returns a #REF! error because the value 680 (beans to France) is not visible.

6. The dynamic GETPIVOTDATA function below returns the amount of mango exported to Canada.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/dynamic-getpivotdata-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this GETPIVOTDATA function has 6 arguments (data field, a reference to any cell inside the pivot table and 2 field/item pairs).
Create a <a href="drop-down-list.html">drop-down list</a> in cell B14 and cell B15 to quickly select the first and second item (see downloadable Excel file).

7. The GETPIVOTDATA function below has 4 arguments (data field, a reference to any cell inside the pivot table and 1 field/item pair) and returns the total amount exported to the USA.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/grand-total.png" loading="lazy">

8. If the total amount exported to the USA changes (for example, by using a filter), the value returned by the GETPIVOTDATA function also changes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/getpivotdata/updated-grand-total.png" loading="lazy">
If you don't want Excel to automatically insert a GETPIVOTDATA function, you can turn off this feature.

9. Click any cell inside the pivot table.

10. On the PivotTable Analyze tab, in the PivotTable group, click the drop-down arrow next to Options and uncheck Generate GetPivotData.

<h2>Merge Tables</h2>
You can use tables and the <a href="vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> in Excel to quickly <k>merge two tables</k>.
This trick will bring your Excel game to a new level.
Our goal is to create one table that consists of a list of cities, countries, and country codes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/two-ranges.png">
First, insert two tables.

1. Select a cell in the first range.

2. On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, click Table.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/insert-table.png">

3. Excel automatically selects the data for you.
Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/create-table.png" loading="lazy">

4. Repeat these steps for the second range.
Result so far:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/two-tables.png" loading="lazy">
Now comes the most important part.

5. Select cell C2 and enter =VLOOKUP(

6. Enter the first argument by selecting cell B2. Excel replaces this cell reference with [@Country] because we're working with tables here.
This is called a <a href="structured-references.html">structured reference</a>.

7. Enter the second argument by selecting the range E2:F6. Excel replaces this range reference with Table2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/structured-references.png" loading="lazy">

8. Use 2 for the third argument because the codes are in the second column of the red table.

9. Use FALSE for the fourth argument to find an exact match.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/vlookup-function.png" loading="lazy">

10. Press Enter.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/merge-tables.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel automatically copied the <k>VLOOKUP function</k> to the other cells.
That saves time.

11. Enter a new city and country.
<k>Excel</k> automatically looks up the corresponding country code for you.
Wow!
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/merge-tables/table-magic.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: tables can make VLOOKUP formulas a lot easier.
Try it yourself.
Download the <a href="excel-files/merge-tables.xlsx">Excel file</a> and enter a new city and country.

<h2>Table as Source Data</h2>
One of the great things about tables in Excel is that your can use a <k>table as source data</k> for a <a href="../data-analysis/charts.html">chart</a>, <a href="../data-analysis/pivot-tables.html">pivot table</a>, etc.
To see why this is useful, let's create a simple chart.

1. Select a cell in the source data.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/source-data.png">

2. Press Ctrl + T to quickly insert a table.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/create-table.png">

3. Press Enter.
Result so far:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/table-as-source-data.png" loading="lazy">

4. On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the Column symbol.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/insert-column-chart.png" loading="lazy">

5. Click Clustered Column.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/click-clustered-column.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/column-chart.png" loading="lazy">
Now comes the most important part.
New rows or columns added to the table will automatically be included in the chart.

6. Select cell A8 and type Jul (Excel automatically formats this new row for you).

7. Enter the data for this month.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/add-new-row-to-table.png" loading="lazy">
Excel automatically updates this dynamic chart.
That's pretty awesome.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/table-as-source-data/dynamic-chart.png" loading="lazy">
Note: as mentioned earlier, you can also use a table to create a dynamic pivot table, or even better, use a table and the new UNIQUE function in Excel 365/2021 to create a <a href="drop-down-list.html#table-magic">magic drop-down list</a>.

<h2>Data Tables</h2>
<a href="#one-variable-data-table">One Variable Data Table</a>  |  <a href="#two-variable-data-table">Two Variable Data Table</a>
Instead of <a href="../data-analysis/what-if-analysis.html#create-different-scenarios">creating different scenarios</a>, you can create a <k>data table</k> to quickly try out different values for formulas.
You can create a one variable data table or a two variable data table.
Assume you own a book store and have 100 books in storage.
You sell a certain % for the highest price of $50 and a certain % for the lower price of $20. If you sell 60% for the highest price, cell D10 below calculates a total profit of 60 * $50 + 40 * $20 = $3800. 
<h3>One Variable Data Table</h3>
To create a one variable data table, execute the following steps.

1. Select cell B12 and type =D10 (refer to the total profit cell).

2. Type the different percentages in column A.

3. Select the range A12:B17. 
We are going to calculate the total profit if you sell 60% for the highest price, 70% for the highest price, etc.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/data-tables/one-variable-data-table-example.png">

4. On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click What-If Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/data-tables/click-what-if-analysis.png">

5. Click Data Table.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/data-tables/click-data-table.png" loading="lazy">

6. Click in the 'Column input cell' box (the percentages are in a column) and select cell C4. 
We select cell C4 because the percentages refer to cell C4 (% sold for the highest price).
Together with the formula in cell B12, Excel now knows that it should replace cell C4 with 60% to calculate the total profit, replace cell C4 with 70% to calculate the total profit, etc.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/data-tables/column-input-cell.png" loading="lazy">
Note: this is a one variable data table so we leave the Row input cell blank.

7. Click OK.
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/data-tables/one-variable-data-table-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: if you sell 60% for the highest price, you obtain a total profit of $3800, if you sell 70% for the highest price, you obtain a total profit of $4100, etc.
Note: the formula bar indicates that the cells contain an array formula.
Therefore, you cannot delete a single result.
To delete the results, select the range B13:B17 and press Delete.
<h3>Two Variable Data Table</h3>
To create a two variable data table, execute the following steps.

1. Select cell A12 and type =D10 (refer to the total profit cell).

2. Type the different unit profits (highest price) in row 12. 

3. Type the different percentages in column A.

4. Select the range A12:D17. 
We are going to calculate the total profit for the different combinations of 'unit profit (highest price)' and '% sold for the highest price'.

8. Click in the 'Column input cell' box (the percentages are in a column) and select cell C4. 
We select cell D7 because the unit profits refer to cell D7. We select cell C4 because the percentages refer to cell C4. Together with the formula in cell A12, Excel now knows that it should replace cell D7 with $50 and cell C4 with 60% to calculate the total profit, replace cell D7 with $50 and cell C4 with 70% to calculate the total profit, etc.

<h3>More about Goal Seek</h3>
There are many problems Goal Seek can't solve.
Goal Seek requires a single input cell and a single output (formula) cell.
Use the <a href="../data-analysis/solver.html">Solver</a> in Excel to solve problems with multiple input cells.
Sometimes you need to start with a different input value to find a solution.

1. The formula in cell B1 below produces a result of -0.25. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/goal-seek/formula.png" loading="lazy">              

2. Use Goal Seek to find the input value that produces a formula result of +0.25. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/goal-seek/goal-seek-problem.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
Excel can't find a solution.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/goal-seek/goal-seek-status.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click Cancel.

4. Start with an input value greater than 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/goal-seek/input-value-greater-than-8.png" loading="lazy">

5. Use Goal Seek again.
Excel finds a solution.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/goal-seek/goal-seeking.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: y = 1 / (x - 8) is discontinuous at x = 8 (dividing by 0 is not possible).
In this example, Goal seek cannot reach one side of the x-axis (x>8) if it starts on the other side of the x-axis (x&lt;8) or vice versa.
<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
A <k>quadratic equation</k> is of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 where a ≠ 0. A quadratic equation can be solved by using the quadratic formula.
You can also use <k>Excel's Goal Seek</k> feature to solve a quadratic equation.

1. For example, we have the formula y = 3x<sup>2</sup> - 12x + 9.5. It's easy to calculate y for any given x.
For x = 1, y = 0.5<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quadratic-equation/formula-1.png">

2. For x = 2, y = -2.5
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quadratic-equation/formula-2.png">

3. But what if we want to know x for any given y? For example, y = 24.5. We need to solve 3x<sup>2</sup> - 12x + 9.5 = 24.5. We can solve the quadratic equation 3x<sup>2</sup> - 12x + 9.5 - 24.5 = 0 by using the quadratic formula.

3x<sup>2</sup> - 12x -15 = 0

a = 3, b = -12, c = -15

D = b<sup>2</sup>- 4ac = (-12)<sup>2</sup> - 4 * 3 * -15 = 144 + 180 = 324

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quadratic-equation/click-what-if-analysis.png" loading="lazy">

5. Click Goal Seek.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quadratic-equation/click-goal-seek.png" loading="lazy">
The Goal Seek dialog box appears.

6. Select cell B2. 

7. Click in the 'To value' box and type 24.5

8. Click in the 'By changing cell' box and select cell A2. 

9. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quadratic-equation/goal-seek-parameters.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/quadratic-equation/solve-quadratic-equation.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Excel returns the solution x = 5. Excel finds the other solution if you start with an x-value closer to x = -1. For example, enter the value 0 into cell A2 and repeat steps 5 to 9. To find the roots, set y = 0 and solve the quadratic equation 3x<sup>2</sup> - 12x + 9.5 = 0. In this case, set 'To value' to 0. 
<h2>Transportation Problem</h2>
<a href="#formulate-model">Formulate the Model</a>  |  <a href="#trial-error">Trial and Error</a>  |  <a href="#solve-model">Solve the Model</a>
Use the solver in <k>Excel</k> to find the number of units to ship from each factory to each customer that minimizes the total cost.
<h3>Formulate the Model</h3>
The model we are going to solve looks as follows in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/transportation-problem-example.png">

1. To formulate this <k>transportation problem</k>, answer the following three questions.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255, 255, 0); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">a.</font> What are the decisions to be made? For this problem, we need Excel to find out how many units to ship from each factory to each customer.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(204, 255, 255); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">b.</font> What are the constraints on these decisions? Each factory has a fixed supply and each customer has a fixed demand.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(51, 102, 153); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"><font color="#FFFFFF">c.</font></font> What is the overall measure of performance for these decisions? The overall measure of performance is the total cost of the shipments, so the objective is to minimize this quantity.

2. To make the model easier to understand, create the following <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>.
<table class="gridtable" width="292">
<tr>
<th width="178">Range Name</th>
<th width="114">Cells</th>

<tr>
<td>UnitCost</td>
<td>C4:E6</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Supply</td>
<td>I10:I12</td>

</tr>
</table>


3. Insert the following functions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/insert-functions.png">
Explanation: The SUM functions calculate the total shipped from each factory (Total Out) to each customer (Total In).
Total Cost equals the <a href="../examples/sumproduct.html">sumproduct</a> of UnitCost and Shipments.
<h3>Trial and Error</h3>
With this formulation, it becomes easy to analyze any trial solution.
For example, if we ship 100 units from Factory 1 to Customer 1, 200 units from Factory 2 to Customer 2, 100 units from Factory 3 to Customer 1 and 200 units from Factory 3 to Customer 3, Total Out equals Supply and Total In equals Demand.This solution has a total cost of 27800. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/trial-solution.png" loading="lazy">
It is not necessary to use trial and error.
We shall describe next how the <k>Excel Solver</k> can be used to quickly find the optimal solution.
<h3>Solve the Model</h3>
To find the optimal solution, execute the following steps.

1. On the Data tab, in the Analyze group, click Solver.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/click-solver.png" loading="lazy">
Note: can't find the Solver button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/solver.html#load-solver-add-in">Solver add-in</a>.
Enter the solver parameters (read on).
The result should be consistent with the picture below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/solver-parameters.png" loading="lazy">
You have the choice of typing the range names or clicking on the cells in the spreadsheet.

2. Enter TotalCost for the Objective.

3. Click Min.

4. Enter Shipments for the Changing Variable Cells.

5. Click Add to enter the following constraint.

6. Click Add to enter the following constraint.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/supply-constraint.png" loading="lazy">

7. Check 'Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative' and select 'Simplex LP'.

8. Finally, click Solve.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/solver-results.png" loading="lazy">
The optimal solution:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/transportation-problem/transportation-problem-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: it is optimal to ship 100 units from Factory 1 to Customer 2, 100 units from Factory 2 to Customer 2, 100 units from Factory 2 to Customer 3, 200 units from Factory 3 to Customer 1 and 100 units from Factory 3 to Customer 3. This solution gives the minimum cost of 26000. All constraints are satisfied.
<h2>Assignment Problem</h2>

Total Cost equals the <a href="../examples/sumproduct.html">sumproduct</a> of Cost and Assignment.
<h3>Trial and Error</h3>
With this formulation, it becomes easy to analyze any trial solution.
For example, if we assign Person 1 to Task 1, Person 2 to task 2 and Person 3 to Task 3, Tasks Assigned equals Supply and Persons Assigned equals Demand.This solution has a total cost of 147.

<h2>Capital Investment</h2>
<a href="#formulate-model">Formulate the Model</a>  |  <a href="#trial-error">Trial and Error</a>  |  <a href="#solve-model">Solve the Model</a>
Use the solver in <k>Excel</k> to find the combination of <k>capital investments</k> that maximizes the total profit.
<h3>Formulate the Model</h3>
The model we are going to solve looks as follows in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/capital-investment/capital-investment-example.png">

1. To formulate this binary integer programming (BIP) model, answer the following three questions.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255, 255, 0); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">a.</font> What are the decisions to be made? For this problem, we need Excel to find out which capital investments to make (Yes=1, No=0).
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(204, 255, 255); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">b.</font> What are the constraints on these decisions? First, the amount of capital used by the investments cannot exceed the limited amount of capital available (50).
For example, investment One  uses 12 units of capital.Second, only investment One or investment Two can be made.
Third, only investment Three or investment Four can be made.
Fourth, investment Six and investment Seven can only be made if investment Five is made.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(51, 102, 153); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"><font color="#FFFFFF">c.</font></font> What is the overall measure of performance for these decisions? The overall measure of performance is the total profit of the capital investments made, so the objective is to maximize this quantity.

2. To make the model easier to understand, create the following <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>.
<table class="gridtable" width="292">
<tr>
<th width="178">Range Name
</th>
<th width="114">Cells
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Profit</td>
<td>C5:I5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>YesNo</td>
<td>C13:I13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TotalProfit</td>
<td>M13</td>
</tr>
</table>


3. Insert the following five SUMPRODUCT functions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/capital-investment/sumproduct-functions.png">
Explanation: cell K7 (the amount of capital used) equals the <a href="../examples/sumproduct.html">sumproduct</a> of the range C7:I7 and YesNo, cell K8 equals the sumproduct of the range C8:I8 and YesNo, etc.
Total Profit equals the sumproduct of Profit and YesNo.
<h3>Trial and Error</h3>
With this formulation, it becomes easy to analyze any trial solution.

1. For example, if we make investment One and Two, the second constraint is violated.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/capital-investment/second-constraint-violated.png" loading="lazy">

2. For example, if we make investment Six and Seven, without making investment Five, the fourth constraint is violated.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/capital-investment/fourth-constraint-violated.png" loading="lazy">

3. However, it's OK to make investment One, Five and Six.
All constraints are satisfied.

This solution gives the maximum profit of 146. All constraints are satisfied.
<h2>Shortest Path Problem</h2>
<a href="#formulate-model">Formulate the Model</a>  |  <a href="#trial-error">Trial and Error</a>  |  <a href="#solve-model">Solve the Model</a>
Use the solver in <k>Excel</k> to find the <k>shortest path</k> from node S to node T in an undirected network.
Points in a network are called nodes (S, A, B, C, D, E and T).
Lines in a network are called arcs (SA, SB, SC, AC, etc).
<h3>Formulate the Model</h3>
The model we are going to solve looks as follows in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/shortest-path-problem/shortest-path-problem-example.png">

1. To formulate this <k>shortest path problem</k>, answer the following three questions.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255, 255, 0); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">a.</font> What are the decisions to be made? For this problem, we need Excel to find out if an arc is on the shortest path or not (Yes=1, No=0).
For example, if SB is part of the shortest path, cell F5 equals 1. If not, cell F5 equals 0. <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(204, 255, 255); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">b.</font> What are the constraints on these decisions? The Net Flow (Flow Out - Flow In) of each node should be equal to Supply/Demand.
Node S should only have one outgoing arc (Net Flow = 1).
Node T should only have one ingoing arc (Net Flow = -1).
All other nodes should have one outgoing arc and one ingoing arc if the node is on the shortest path (Net Flow = 0) or no flow (Net Flow = 0).
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(51, 102, 153); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"><font color="#FFFFFF">c.</font></font> What is the overall measure of performance for these decisions? The overall measure of performance is the total distance of the shortest path, so the objective is to minimize this quantity.

2. To make the model easier to understand, create the following <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>.
<table class="gridtable" width="292">
<tr>
<th width="178">Range Name</th>

<tr>
<td>SupplyDemand</td>
<td>K4:K10</td>

</tr>
</table>


3. Insert the following functions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/shortest-path-problem/insert-functions.png">
Explanation: The <a href="sumif.html">SUMIF</a> functions calculate the Net Flow of each node.
For node S, the SUMIF function sums the values in the Go column with an "S" in the From column.As a result, only cell F4, F5 or F6 can be 1 (one outgoing arc).
For node T, the SUMIF function sums the values in the Go column with a "T" in the To column.As a result, only cell F15, F18 or F21 can be 1 (one ingoing arc).
For all other nodes, Excel looks in the From and To column.Total Distance equals the <a href="../examples/sumproduct.html">sumproduct</a> of Distance and Go.
<h3>Trial and Error</h3>
With this formulation, it becomes easy to analyze any trial solution.

1. For example, the path SBET has a total distance of 16. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/shortest-path-problem/trial-solution.png" loading="lazy">
It is not necessary to use trial and error.
We shall describe next how the <k>Excel Solver</k> can be used to quickly find the optimal solution.
<h3>Solve the Model</h3>
To find the optimal solution, execute the following steps.

Conclusion: SADCT is the shortest path with a total distance of 11. 
<h2>Maximum Flow Problem</h2>
<a href="#formulate-model">Formulate the Model</a>  |  <a href="#trial-error">Trial and Error</a>  |  <a href="#solve-model">Solve the Model</a>
Use the solver in <k>Excel</k> to find the <k>maximum flow</k> from node S to node T in a directed network.
Points in a network are called nodes (S, A, B, C, D, E and T).
Lines in a network are called arcs (SA, SB, SC, AC, etc).
<h3>Formulate the Model</h3>
The model we are going to solve looks as follows in Excel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maximum-flow-problem/maximum-flow-problem-example.png">

1. To formulate this <k>maximum flow problem</k>, answer the following three questions.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255, 255, 0); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">a.</font> What are the decisions to be made? For this problem, we need Excel to find the flow on each arc.
For example, if the flow on SB is 2, cell D5 equals 2. <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(204, 255, 255); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;">b.</font> What are the constraints on these decisions? The Net Flow (Flow Out - Flow In) of node A, B, C, D and E should be equal to 0. In other words, Flow Out = Flow In.
Also, each arc has a fixed capacity.
The flow on each arc should be less than this capacity.
<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(51, 102, 153); border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"><font color="#FFFFFF">c.</font></font> What is the overall measure of performance for these decisions? The overall measure of performance is the maximum flow, so the objective is to maximize this quantity.
The maximum flow equals the Flow Out of node S.

2. To make the model easier to understand, create the following <a href="named-range.html">named ranges</a>.
<table class="gridtable" width="292">
<tr>
<th width="178">Range Name</th>
<th width="114">Cells</th>

<tr>
<td>SupplyDemand</td>
<td>K5:K9</td>

</tr>
</table>


3. Insert the following functions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maximum-flow-problem/insert-functions.png">
Explanation: The <a href="sumif.html">SUMIF</a> functions calculate the Net Flow of each node.
For node A, the first SUMIF function sums the values in the Flow column with an "A" in the From column (Flow Out).The second SUMIF function sums the values in the Flow column with an "A" in the To column (Flow In).
Maximum Flow equals the value in cell I4, which is the flow out of node S.
Because node A, B, C, D and E have a Net Flow of 0, Flow Out of node S will equal Flow In of node T.
<h3>Trial and Error</h3>
With this formulation, it becomes easy to analyze any trial solution.

1. For example, the path SADT with a flow of 2. The path SCT with a flow of 4. The path SBET with a flow of 2. These paths givea total flow of 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maximum-flow-problem/trial-solution.png" loading="lazy">
It is not necessary to use trial and error.
We shall describe next how the <k>Excel Solver</k> can be used to quickly find the optimal solution.
<h3>Solve the Model</h3>
To find the optimal solution, execute the following steps.

1. On the Data tab, in the Analyze group, click Solver.

You have the choice of typing the range names or clicking on the cells in the spreadsheet.

2. Enter MaximumFlow for the Objective.

3. Click Max.

4. Enter Flow for the Changing Variable Cells.

5. Click Add to enter the following constraint.

8. Finally, click Solve.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maximum-flow-problem/solver-results.png" loading="lazy">
The optimal solution:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/maximum-flow-problem/maximum-flow-problem-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: the path SADT with a flow of 2. The path SCT with a flow of 4. The path SBET with a flow of 2. The path SCET with a flow of 2. The path SACET with a flow of 1. The path SACDT with a flow of 1. These paths givea maximum flow of 12. 
<h2>Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
<a href="#reduced-cost">Reduced Cost</a>  |  <a href="#shadow-price">Shadow Price</a>
<k>Sensitivity analysis</k> gives you insight in how the optimal solution changes when you change the coefficients of the model.
After the solver found a solution, you can create a <k>sensitivity report</k>.

1. Before you click OK, select Sensitivity from the Reports section.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/select-sensitivity.png">
Below you can find the optimal solution and the sensitivity report.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/optimal-solution.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/sensitivity-report.png" loading="lazy">
It is optimal to order 94 bicycles and 54 mopeds.
This solution gives the maximum profit of 25600. This solution uses all the resources available (93000 units of capital and 101 units of storage).
You can find these numbers in the Final Value column.
<h3>Reduced Cost</h3>
The reduced costs tell us how much the objective coefficients (unit profits) can be increased or decreased before the optimal solution changes.
If we increase the unit profit of Child Seats with 20 or more units, the optimal solution changes.

1. At a unit profit of 69, it's still optimal to order 94 bicycles and 54 mopeds.
Below you can find the optimal solution.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/reduced-cost-example.png" loading="lazy">

2. At a unit profit of 71, the optimal solution changes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/reduced-cost-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: it is only profitable to order child seats if you can sell them for at least 70 units.
<h3>Shadow Price</h3>
The shadow prices tell us how much the optimal solution can be increased or decreased if we change the right hand side values (resources available) with one unit.

1. With 101 units of storage available, the total profit is 25600. Below you can find the optimal solution.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/shadow-price-example.png" loading="lazy">

2. With 102 units of storage available, the total profit is 25700 (+100).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/sensitivity-analysis/shadow-price-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: with a shadow price of 100 for this resource, this is according to our expectations.
This shadow price is only valid between 101 - 23,5 and 101 + 54 (see sensitivity report).

<h2>Anova</h2>
This example teaches you how to perform a single factor <k>ANOVA</k> (analysis of variance) in <k>Excel</k>.
A single factor or one-way ANOVA is used to test the null hypothesis that the means of several populations are all equal.
Below you can find the salaries of people who have a degree in economics, medicine or history.
H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub> = μ<sub>3</sub>

H<sub>1</sub>: at least one of the means is different.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/anova/anova-example.png">
To perform a single factor <k>ANOVA</k>, execute the following steps.

1. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/anova/click-data-analysis.png">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

2. Select Anova: Single Factor and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/anova/select-anova-single-factor.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click in the Input Range box and select the range A2:C10. 

4. Click in the Output Range box and select cell E1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/anova/anova-parameters.png" loading="lazy">

5. Click OK.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/anova/anova-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: if F > F crit, we reject the null hypothesis.
This is the case, 15.196 > 3.443. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
The means of the three populations are not all equal.
At least one of the means is different.
However, the <k>ANOVA</k> does not tell you where the difference lies.
You need a <a href="t-test.html">t-Test</a> to test each pair of means.
<h2>F-Test</h2>
This example teaches you how to perform an <k>F-Test</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
The F-Test is used to test the null hypothesis that the variances of two populations are equal.
Below you can find the study hours of 6 female students and 5 male students.
H<sub>0</sub>: σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = σ<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>

H<sub>1</sub>: σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> ≠ σ<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/f-test/f-test-example.png">
To perform an F-Test, execute the following steps.

1. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/f-test/click-data-analysis.png">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

2. Select F-Test Two-Sample for Variances and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/f-test/select-f-test-two-sample-for-variances.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click in the Variable <u>1</u> Range box and select the range A2:A7. 

4. Click in the Variable <u>2</u> Range box and select the range B2:B6. 

5. Click in the Output Range box and select cell E1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/f-test/f-test-parameters.png" loading="lazy">

6. Click OK.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/f-test/f-test-result.png" loading="lazy">
Important: be sure that the variance of Variable 1 is higher than the variance of Variable 2. This is the case, 160 > 21.7. If not, swap your data.
As a result, Excel calculates the correct F value, which is the ratio of Variance 1 to Variance 2 (F = 160 / 21.7 = 7.373).
Conclusion: if F > F Critical one-tail, we reject the null hypothesis.
This is the case, 7.373 > 6.256. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
The variances of the two populations are unequal.
<h2>t-Test</h2>
This example teaches you how to perform a <k>t-Test</k> in <k>Excel</k>.
The t-Test is used to test the null hypothesis that the means of two populations are equal.
Below you can find the study hours of 6 female students and 5 male students.
H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> = 0

H<sub>1</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> ≠ 0
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/t-test/t-test-example.png">
To perform a t-Test, execute the following steps.

1. First, perform an <a href="f-test.html">F-Test</a> to determine if the variances of the two populations are equal.
This is not the case.

2. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/anova/click-data-analysis.png">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

3. Select t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/t-test/select-t-test-two-sample-assuming-unequal-variances.png" loading="lazy">

4. Click in the Variable <u>1</u> Range box and select the range A2:A7. 

5. Click in the Variable <u>2</u> Range box and select the range B2:B6. 

6. Click in the Hypothesized Mean Difference box and type 0 (H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> = 0).

7. Click in the Output Range box and select cell E1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/t-test/t-test-parameters.png" loading="lazy">

8. Click OK.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/t-test/t-test-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: We do a two-tail test (inequality).
lf t Stat &lt; -t Critical two-tail or t Stat > t Critical two-tail, we reject the null hypothesis.
This is not the case, -2.365 &lt; 1.473 &lt; 2.365. Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis.
The observed difference between the sample means (33 - 24.8) is not convincing enough to say that the average number of study hours between female and male students differ significantly.
<h2>Moving Average</h2>
This example teaches you how to calculate the <k>moving average</k> of a time series in <k>Excel</k>.
A moving average is used to smooth out irregularities (peaks and valleys) to easily recognize trends.

1. First, let's take a look at our time series.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/moving-average/time-series.png">

2. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/moving-average/click-data-analysis.png">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

3. Select Moving Average and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/moving-average/select-moving-average.png" loading="lazy">

4. Click in the Input Range box and select the range B2:M2. 

5. Click in the Interval box and type 6. 

6. Click in the Output Range box and select cell B3. 

7. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/moving-average/moving-average-parameters.png" loading="lazy">

8. Plot a graph of these values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/moving-average/increasing-trend.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: because we set the interval to 6, the moving average is the average of the previous 5 data points and the current data point.
As a result, peaks and valleys are smoothed out.
The graph shows an increasing trend.
Excel cannot calculate the moving average for the first 5 data points because there are not enough previous data points.

9. Repeat steps 2 to 8 for interval = 2 and interval = 4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/moving-average/different-intervals.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: The larger the interval, the more the peaks and valleys are smoothed out.
The smaller the interval, the closer the moving averages are to the actual data points.
<h2>Exponential Smoothing</h2>
This example teaches you how to apply <k>exponential smoothing</k> to a time series in <k>Excel</k>.
Exponential smoothing is used to smooth out irregularities (peaks and valleys) to easily recognize trends.

1. First, let's take a look at our time series.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/exponential-smoothing/time-series.png">

2. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/exponential-smoothing/click-data-analysis.png">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

3. Select Exponential Smoothing and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/exponential-smoothing/select-exponential-smoothing.png" loading="lazy">

4. Click in the Input Range box and select the range B2:M2. 

5. Click in the Damping factor box and type 0.9. Literature often talks about the smoothing constant α (alpha).
The value (1- α) is called the damping factor.

6. Click in the Output Range box and select cell B3. 

7. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/exponential-smoothing/exponential-smoothing-parameters.png" loading="lazy">

8. Plot a graph of these values.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/exponential-smoothing/increasing-trend.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: because we set alpha to 0.1, the previous data point is given a relatively small weight while the previous smoothed value is given a large weight (i.e.

0.9).
As a result, peaks and valleys are smoothed out.
The graph shows an increasing trend.
Excel cannot calculate the smoothed value for the first data point because there is no previous data point.
The smoothed value for the second data point equals the previous data point.

9. Repeat steps 2 to 8 for alpha = 0.3 and alpha = 0.8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/exponential-smoothing/different-alphas.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: The smaller alpha (larger the damping factor), the more the peaks and valleys are smoothed out.
The larger alpha (smaller the damping factor), the closer the smoothed values are to the actual data points.
<h2>Correlation</h2>
The <k>correlation</k> coefficient (a value between -1 and +1) tells you how strongly two variables are related to each other.
We can use the <k>CORREL function</k> or the <k>Analysis Toolpak add-in</k> in <k>Excel</k> to find the correlation coefficient between two variables.
- A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
As variable X increases, variable Y increases.
As variable X decreases, variable Y decreases.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/perfect-positive-correlation.png">
- A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.
As variable X increases, variable Z decreases.
As variable X decreases, variable Z increases.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/perfect-negative-correlation.png">
- A correlation coefficient near 0 indicates no correlation.
To use the Analysis Toolpak add-in in Excel to quickly generate correlation coefficients between multiple variables, execute the following steps.

1. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/click-data-analysis.png" loading="lazy">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

2. Select Correlation and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/select-correlation.png" loading="lazy">

3. For example, select the range A1:C6 as the Input Range.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/select-input-range.png" loading="lazy">

4. Check Labels in first row.

5. Select cell A8 as the Output Range.

6. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/input-output-options.png" loading="lazy">
Result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/correlation/correlation-coefficients.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: variables A and C are positively correlated (0.91).
Variables A and B are not correlated (0.19).
Variables B and C are also not correlated (0.11)
.
You can verify these conclusions by looking at the graph.
<h2>Regression</h2>

This example teaches you how to run a <k>linear regression analysis</k> in <k>Excel</k> and how to interpret the Summary Output.
Below you can find our data.
The big question is: is there a relation between Quantity Sold (Output) and Price and Advertising (Input).
In other words: can we predict Quantity Sold if we know Price and Advertising?
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/regression-data.png">

1. On the Data tab, in the Analysis group, click Data Analysis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/click-data-analysis.png">
Note: can't find the Data Analysis button? Click here to load the <a href="../data-analysis/analysis-toolpak.html">Analysis ToolPak add-in</a>.

2. Select Regression and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/select-regression.png" loading="lazy">

3. Select the <u>Y</u> Range (A1:A8).
This is the predictor variable (also called dependent variable).

4. Select the <u>X</u> Range(B1:C8).
These are the explanatory variables (also called independent variables).
These columns must be adjacent to each other.

5. Check Labels.

6. Click in the Output Range box and select cell A11. 

7. Check Residuals.

8. Click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/Regression-input-output.png" loading="lazy">
Excel produces the following Summary Output (rounded to 3 decimal places).
<h3>R Square</h3>
R Square equals <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255, 255, 204)">0.962</font>, which is a very good fit.

96% of the variation in Quantity Sold is explained by the independent variables Price and Advertising.
The closer to 1, the better the regression line (read on) fits the data.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/r-square.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Significance F and P-values</h3>
To check if your results are reliable (statistically significant), look at Significance F (<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(196, 215, 155)">0.001</font>).
If this value is less than 0.05, you're OK.
If Significance F is greater than 0.05, it's probably better to stop using this set of independent variables.
Delete a variable with a high P-value (greater than 0.05) and rerun the regression until Significance F drops below 0.05. 
Most or all P-values should be below below 0.05. In our example this is the case.
(<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(196, 215, 155)">0.000</font>, <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(196, 215, 155)">0.001</font> and <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(196, 215, 155)">0.005</font>).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/anova.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>Coefficients</h3>
The regression line is: y = Quantity Sold = <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(149, 179, 215)">8536.214</font> <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(149, 179, 215)">-835.722</font> * Price + <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(149, 179, 215)">0.592</font> * Advertising.
In other words, for each unit increase in price, Quantity Sold decreases with 835.722 units.
For each unit increase in Advertising, Quantity Sold increases with 0.592 units.This is valuable information.
You can also use these coefficients to do a forecast.
For example, if price equals $4 and Advertising equals $3000, you might be able to achieve a Quantity Sold of 8536.214 -835.722 * 4 + 0.592 * 3000 = 6970. <h3>Residuals</h3>
The residuals show you how far away the actual data points are fom the predicted data points (using the equation).
For example, the first data point equals 8500. Using the equation, the predicted data point equals 8536.214 -835.722 * 2 + 0.592 * 2800 = 8523.009, giving a residual of 8500 - 8523.009 = <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(218, 150, 148)">-23.009</font>.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/images/regression/residuals.png" loading="lazy">
You can also create a scatter plot of these residuals.

<h2>Swap Values</h2>
This example teaches you how to <k>swap two values</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
You will often need this structure in more complicated programs as we will see later.
Situation:
Two values on your worksheet.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/swap-values/swap-values-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare a <a href="../variables.html">variable</a> called temp of type Double.
Dim temp As Double

2. We initialize the variable temp with the value of cell A1. 
temp = Range("A1").Value

3. Now we can safely write the value of cell B1 to cell A1 (we have stored the value of cell A1 to temp so we will not lose it).
Range("A1").Value = Range("B1").Value

4. Finally, we write the value of cell A1 (written to temp) to cell B1. 
Range("B1").Value = temp

5. Click the command button two times.

Sub Cyan()End Sub
Note: a procedure is either a sub or a function.
Learn more about <a href="../function-sub.html">functions and subs</a> here, if you like.

4. The sub changes the background color of your worksheet to cyan.
To achieve this, add the following code line.
Cells.Interior.ColorIndex = 28
Note: instead of ColorIndex number 28 (cyan), you can use any ColorIndex number.
To run the procedure, execute the following steps.

5. Click Macros.

<a href="#record-macro">Record a Macro</a>  |  <a href="#run-recorded-macro">Run a Recorded Macro</a>  |  <a href="#see-macro">See the Macro</a>
The <k>Macro Recorder</k>, a very useful tool included in <k>Excel VBA</k>, records every task you perform with Excel.
All you have to do is record a specific task once.
Next, you can execute the task over and over with the click of a button.
The Macro Recorder is also a great help when you don't know how to program a specific task in Excel VBA.
Simply open the Visual Basic Editor after recording the task to see how it can be programmed.
Unfortunately, there are a lot of things you cannot do with the Macro Recorder.
For example, you cannot <a href="../loop.html">loop</a> through a range of data with the Macro Recorder.Moreover, the Macro Recorder uses a lot more code than is required, which can slow your process down.
<h3>Record a Macro</h3>

1. On the Developer tab, click Record Macro.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-recorder/record-macro.png">

2. Enter a name.

3. Select This Workbook from the drop-down list.
As a result, the macro will only be available in the current workbook.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-recorder/select-this-workbook.png">
Note: if you store your macro in Personal Macro Workbook, the macro will be available to all your workbooks (Excel files).
This is possible because Excel stores your macro in a hidden workbook that opens automatically when Excel starts.
If you store your macro in New Workbook, the macro will only be available in an automatically new opened workbook.

4. Click OK.

5. Right mouse click on the active cell (selected cell).
Be sure not to select any other cell! Next, click Format Cells.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-recorder/format-cells.png" loading="lazy">

6. Select Percentage.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-recorder/select-percentage.png" loading="lazy">

Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-recorder/macro-recorder-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h3>See the Macro</h3>
To take a look at the macro, open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-recorder/visual-basic-editor.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the macro has been placed into a module called Module1. Code placed into a module is available to the whole workbook.
That means you change the number format of cells on other sheets as well.
Remember, code placed on a sheet (assigned to a command button) is only available for that particular sheet.
You can ignore the <a href="option-explicit.html">Option Explicit</a> statement for now.
<h2>Use Relative References</h2>
By default, <k>Excel records macros</k> in absolute mode.
However, sometimes it is useful to record macros in <k>relative mode</k>.
This program teaches you how to do this.
If you don't know how to <a href="macro-recorder.html">record a macro</a>, we highly recommend you to read this example first.
<h3>Recording in Absolute Mode</h3>
To record a macro in absolute mode, execute the following steps.

1. <u>First</u>, click Record Macro.

2. Next, select cell B3. Type Sales and press enter.

3. Type Production and press enter.

4. Type Logistics and press enter.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/use-relative-references/recording-in-absolute-mode.png">

5. Click Stop Recording.

6. Empty Range("B3:B5").

7. Select any cell on the sheet and run the recorded macro.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/use-relative-references/recording-in-absolute-mode.png">
A macro recorded in absolute mode always produces the same result.
<h3>Recording in Relative Mode</h3>
Wouldn't it be nice to place these words anywhere on the sheet automatically? Not just Range("B3:B5").
This would make the macro much more flexible.
Solution: record the macro in relative mode.

1. Select "Use Relative References".
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/use-relative-references/use-relative-references.png" loading="lazy">

2. First, select any single cell (for example, cell B8).

3. Next, click Record Macro.

4. Type Sales and press enter.

5. Type Production and press enter.

6. Type Logistics and press enter.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/use-relative-references/recording-relative-mode.png" loading="lazy">

7. Click Stop Recording.

8. Select any other cell (for example, cell D4) and run the recorded macro.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/use-relative-references/recording-in-relative-mode-result.png" loading="lazy">
Excel places the words relative to the initial selected cell.
That's why it's called recording in relative mode.
<h2>FormulaR1C1</h2>
This example illustrates the difference between <k>A1</k>, <k>R1C1</k> and <k>R[1]C[1] style</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.

1. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line (A1 style):
Range("D4").Formula = "=B3*10"
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/formulaR1C1/A1-style.png">

2. Add the following code line (R1C1 style):
Range("D4").FormulaR1C1 = "=R3C2*10"
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/formulaR1C1/R1C1-style.png">
Explanation: cell D4 references cell B3 (row 3, column 2).
This is an absolute reference ($ symbol in front of the row number and column letter).

3. Add the following code line (R[1]C[1] style):
Range("D4").FormulaR1C1 = "=R[-1]C[-2]*10"
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/formulaR1C1/R%5B1%5DC%5B1%5D-style.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: cell D4 references cell B3 (one row above and 2 columns to the left).
This is a relative reference.
This code line gives the exact same result as the code line used at step 1. 

4. Why learning about this? Because the <a href="macro-recorder.html">Macro Recorder</a> uses the FormulaR1C1 property (R[1]C[1] style).
The Macro Recorder creates the following code lines if you enter the formula =B3*10 into cell D4. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/formulaR1C1/macro-recorder-result.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: you can see that this is the exact same code line used at step 3. 
<h2>Add a Macro to the Toolbar</h2>
If you use an <k>Excel macro</k> frequently, you can <k>add it to the Quick Access Toolbar</k>.
This way you can quickly access your macro.
First, we record an empty macro.

1. On the Developer tab, click Record Macro.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/add-a-macro-to-the-toolbar/click-record-macro.png">

2. Name the macro MyName.
Choose to store the macro in Personal Macro Workbook.
This way the macro will be available to all your workbooks (Excel files).
This is possible because Excel stores your macro in a hidden workbook that opens automatically when Excel starts.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/add-a-macro-to-the-toolbar/store-macro-in-personal-macro-workbook.png">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/add-a-macro-to-the-toolbar/quickly-access-macro.png" loading="lazy">

14. When you close Excel, Excel asks you to save the changes you made to the Personal Macro Workbook.
Click Save to store this macro in a hidden workbook that opens automatically when Excel starts.
This way the macro will be available to all your workbooks (Excel files).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/add-a-macro-to-the-toolbar/save-changes-to-the-personal-macro-workbook.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Enable Macros</h2>
Enable macros in Excel when the message bar appears.

With this security level you don't have to enable macros all the time.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/enable-macros/enable-all-macros.png" loading="lazy">

5. If you're new to Excel VBA, let's <a href="../create-a-macro.html">create a simple macro</a>.
<h2>Protect Macro</h2>
Just like you can password protect workbooks and worksheets, you can <k>password protect a macro</k> in <k>Excel</k> from being viewed (and executed).
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, create a simple macro that you want to protect.
Range("A1").Value = "This is secret code"

2. Next, click Tools, VBAProject Properties.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/protect-macro/click-tools-vbaproject-properties.png">

3. On the Protection tab, check "Lock project for viewing" and enter a password twice.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/protect-macro/enter-password-twice.png">

4. Click OK.

5. Save, close and reopen the Excel file.
Try to view the code.
The following dialog box will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/protect-macro/password-protected-from-being-viewed.png" loading="lazy">
You can still execute the code by clicking on the command button but you cannot view or edit the code anymore (unless you know the password).
The password for the downloadable Excel file is "easy".

6. If you want to password protect the macro from being <u>executed</u>, add the following code lines:
Dim password As Variant

password = Application.InputBox("Enter Password", "Password Protected")

Select Case password

Case Is = False

'do nothing

Case Is = "easy"

Range("A1").Value = "This is secret code"

Case Else

MsgBox "Incorrect Password"
End Select
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/protect-macro/password-protected-from-being-executed.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: The macro uses the InputBox method of the Application object.
If the users clicks Cancel, this method returns False and nothing happens (InputBox disappears).
Only when the user knows the password ("easy" again), the secret code will be executed.
If the entered password is incorrect, a MsgBox is displayed.
Note that the user cannot take a look at the password in the Visual Basic Editor because the project is protected from being viewed.
<h2>MsgBox Function</h2>
The <k>MsgBox function</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> can return a result while a simple MsgBox cannot.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/msgbox-function/msgbox-function-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare a variable called answer of type Integer.
Dim answer As Integer

2. We use the MsgBox function to initialize the variable answer with the input from the user.
The MsgBox function, when using parentheses, has three arguments.
The first part is used for the message in the message box.
Use the second part to specify which buttons and icons you want to appear in the message box.
The third part is displayed in the title bar of the message box.
answer = MsgBox("Are you sure you want to empty the sheet?", vbYesNo + vbQuestion, "Empty Sheet")
Note: Place your cursor on vbYesNo in the Visual Basic Editor and click F1 to see which other buttons and icons you can use.
Instead of the constants vbYesNo and vbQuestion, you can also use the corresponding values 4 and 32. 

3. If the user clicks the Yes button, Excel VBA empties the sheet.
If the user clicks the No button, nothing happens.
Add the following code lines to achieve this.
If answer = vbYes Then

Cells.ClearContents
Else

'do nothingEnd If

4. Click the command button on the sheet.

5. Click Yes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/msgbox-function/msgbox-function.png">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/msgbox-function/msgbox-function-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>InputBox Function</h2>
You can use the <k>InputBox function</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> to prompt the user to enter a value.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, declare the variable myValue of type Variant.
Dim myValue As Variant
Note: we use a variable of type Variant here because a Variant variable can hold any type of value.
This way the user can enter text, numbers, etc.

2. Add the following code line to show the input box.
myValue = InputBox("Give me some input")
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/inputbox-function/inputbox-function-example-1.png">

3. Write the value of myValue to cell A1. 
Range("A1").Value = myValue
Result when the user enters the value 5 and clicks the OK button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/inputbox-function/inputbox-function-result-1.png">

4. The InputBox function has more optional arguments.
The following code line shows an input box with a title displayed in the title bar and has a default value.
The default value will be used if no other input is provided.
myValue = InputBox("Give me some input", "Hi", 1)
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/inputbox-function/inputbox-function-example-2.png" loading="lazy">
Result when the user only clicks the OK button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/inputbox-function/inputbox-function-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Place your cursor on InputBox in the Visual Basic Editor and click F1 for help on the other optional arguments.
<h2>Path and FullName</h2>
The <k>Path property</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> returns the complete, saved path to the workbook (Excel file).
The <k>FullName property</k> in Excel VBA returns the complete, saved path, including the name of the workbook.
Download path-fullname.xlsm and add it to "C:\test\"
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. The following code line returns the complete path to path-fullname.xlsm.
MsgBox Workbooks("path-fullname.xlsm").Path
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/path-fullname/path-property-result.png">

2. The following code line returns the complete path, including the name of the active workbook.
MsgBox ActiveWorkbook.FullName
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/path-fullname/fullname-property-result.png">
For a practical example of the FullName property, see our example program <a href="create-a-footer-before-printing.html">Create a Footer Before Printing</a>.<h2>Close and Open</h2>
The <k>Close</k> and <k>Open Method</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> can be used to close and open workbooks.
Remember, the Workbooks collection contains all the Workbook objects that are currently open.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. The code line below closes close-open.xlsm.
Workbooks("close-open.xlsm").Close

2. The code line below closes the first opened/created workbook.
Workbooks(1).Close

3. The code line below closes the active workbook.
ActiveWorkbook.Close

4. The code line below closes all workbooks that are currently open.
Workbooks.Close

5. The code line below opens sales.xlsx.
Workbooks.Open ("sales.xlsx")
Note: you can only open sales.xlsx without specifying the file's path if it's stored in your default file location.
To change the default file location, on the File tab, click Options, Save.

6. You can also use the GetOpenFilename method of the Application object to display the standard Open dialog box.
Dim MyFile As String

MyFile = Application.GetOpenFilename()

7. Select a file and click Open.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/close-open/getopenfilename-method.png">
Note: GetOpenFilename doesn't actually open the file.

8. Next, you can open the workbook as usual.
Workbooks.Open (MyFile)
<h2>Loop through Books and Sheets</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>loops through all open workbooks and worksheets</k>, and displays all the names.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-books-sheets/loop-through-books-sheets-example.png">
Add the following code lines to the command button:

1. First, we declare two objects and one variable.
One object of type Workbook we call book, one object of type Worksheet we call sheet, and a variable of type String we call text.
Dim book As Workbook, sheet As Worksheet, text As String

2. We want to loop through all open workbooks.
To achieve this, add the following code line:
For Each book In Workbooks
3. We write the text "Workbook: ", the name of the workbook, and the text "Worksheets: "" to the variable text.
text = text &amp; "Workbook: " &amp; book.Name &amp; vbNewLine &amp; "Worksheets: " &amp; vbNewLine
Note: you can use the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) elements.
To start a new line, you can use vbNewLine.

4. To loop through all the worksheets of a workbook, add the following code line:
For Each sheet In book.Worksheets
5. We write the names of the worksheets of a workbook to the variable text.
text = text &amp; sheet.Name &amp; vbNewLine

6. Close the second loop.Next sheet

7. Add a white line.
text = text &amp; vbNewLine

8. Don't forget to close the first loop.Next book

9. Finally, we display the variable text using a MsgBox.
MsgBox text

10. Test the program.
Before you click on the command button, give your worksheets some descriptive names and open a blank workbook with three worksheets.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-books-sheets/loop-through-books-sheets-result.png">
<h2>Sales Calculator</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>calculates the total sales</k> of each employee over a period of three years.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sales-calculator/sales-calculator-example.png">
The other two sheets have the same setup, but with different combinations of months and employees, and different sales numbers.
There are several ways to calculate the total sales of each employee in Excel, but we will see that it can be done in Excel VBA very easily.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare three variables and one Worksheet object.
One variable of type String we call employee, one variable of type Integer we call total, one Worksheet object we call sheet, and one variable of type Integer we call i.
Dim employee As String, total As Integer, sheet As Worksheet, i As Integer

2. We initialize two variables.
We initialize the variable total with value 0. We use the InputBox function to get the employee name from the user.
total = 0

employee = InputBox("Enter the employee name (case sensitive)")
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sales-calculator/enter-employee-name.png">

3. After the user has entered an employee name, we want to calculate the total sales of this employee.
The workbook consists of three sheets.
We want a program that can still be  used if sheets are added in the future.
Therefore we use the following code line:
For Each sheet In Worksheets
4. We start another For Next loop.
For i = 2 To 13
5. If the entered employee name matches with the employee name in column B, Excel VBA adds the sales number to the variable total.
Add the following code lines:
If sheet.Cells(i, 2).Value = employee Then

total = total + sheet.Cells(i, 3).ValueEnd If

6. Don't forget to close both loops.Next iNext sheet

7. Finally, we display the total sales of the employee using a msgbox.
MsgBox "Total sales of " &amp; employee &amp; " is " &amp; total

8. Test the program.
Result for David:

<h2>Files in a Directory</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>loops through all closed workbooks and worksheets</k> in a <k>directory</k>, and displays all the names.
Download Book1.xlsx, Book2.xlsx, Book3.xlsx, Book4.xlsx and Book5.xlsx and add them to "C:\test\"
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/files-in-a-directory/files-in-a-directory-example.png">
Add the following code lines to the command button:

1. First, we declare two variables of type String, a Worksheet object and two variables of type Integer.
Dim directory As String, fileName As String, sheet As Worksheet, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. To avoid screen flicker, turn off screen updating.
Application.ScreenUpdating = False

3. Initialize the variable directory.
We use the Dir function to find the first *.xl?? file stored in this directory.
directory = "c:\test\"

fileName = Dir(directory &amp; "*.xl??")
Note: the Dir function supports the use of multiple character (*) and single character (?) <a href="../../examples/wildcards.html">wildcards</a> to search for all different type of Excel files.

4. The variable fileName now holds the name of the first Excel file found in the directory.
Add a <a href="../loop.html#do-while-loop">Do While Loop</a>.
Do While fileName &lt;> ""
Loop
Add the following code lines (at 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) to the loop.

5. Initialize the variables of type Integer and add the name of the Excel file to the first column of row i.
i = i + 1

j = 2

Cells(i, 1) = fileName

6. There is no simple way to extract data (or sheet names) from closed Excel files.
Therefore, we open the Excel file.
Workbooks.Open (directory &amp; fileName)

7. Add all the sheet names of the Excel file to the other columns of row i.
For Each sheet In Workbooks(fileName).Worksheets
Workbooks("files-in-a-directory.xlsm").Worksheets(1).Cells(i, j).Value = sheet.Name

j = j + 1Next sheet

8. Close the Excel file.
Workbooks(fileName).Close

9. The Dir function is a special function.
To get the other Excel files, you can use the Dir function again with no arguments.
fileName = Dir()
Note: when no more file names match, the Dir function returns a zero-length string ("").
As a result, Excel VBA will leave the Do While loop.

10. Turn on screen updating again (outside the loop).
Application.ScreenUpdating = True

11. Test the program.
Result:

<h2>Import Sheets</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>imports sheets from other Excel files into one Excel file</k>.
Download Book4.xlsx, Book5.xlsx and add them to "C:\test\"
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/import-sheets/import-sheets-example.png">
Add the following code lines to the command button:

1. First, we declare two variables of type String, a Worksheet object and one variable of type Integer.
Dim directory As String, fileName As String, sheet As Worksheet, total As Integer

2. Turn off screen updating and displaying alerts.
Application.ScreenUpdating = False

Application.DisplayAlerts = False

3. Initialize the variable directory.
We use the Dir function to find the first *.xl?? file stored in this directory.
directory = "c:\test\"

fileName = Dir(directory &amp; "*.xl??")
Note: The Dir function supports the use of multiple character (*) and single character (?) <a href="../../examples/wildcards.html">wildcards</a> to search for all different type of Excel files.

4. The variable fileName now holds the name of the first Excel file found in the directory.
Add a <a href="../loop.html#do-while-loop">Do While Loop</a>.
Do While fileName &lt;> ""
Loop
Add the following code lines (at 5, 6, 7 and 8) to the loop.

5. There is no simple way to copy worksheets from closed Excel files.
Therefore we open the Excel file.
Workbooks.Open (directory &amp; fileName)

6. Import the sheets from the Excel file into import-sheet.xlsm.
For Each sheet In Workbooks(fileName).Worksheets
total = Workbooks("import-sheets.xlsm").Worksheets.count

Workbooks(fileName).Worksheets(sheet.Name).Copy _

after:=Workbooks("import-sheets.xlsm").Worksheets(total)Next sheet
Explanation: the variable total holds track of the total number of worksheets of import-sheet.xlsm.
We use the Copy method of the Worksheet object to copy each worksheet and paste it after the last worksheet of import-sheets.xlsm.

7. Close the Excel file.
Workbooks(fileName).Close

8. The Dir function is a special function.
To get the other Excel files, you can use the Dir function again with no arguments.
fileName = Dir()
Note: When no more file names match, the Dir function returns a zero-length string ("").
As a result, Excel VBA will leave the Do While loop.

9. Turn on screen updating and displaying alerts again (outside the loop).
Application.ScreenUpdating = True

Application.DisplayAlerts = True

10. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/import-sheets/import-sheets-result.png">
<h2>Programming Charts</h2>
Below we will look at two programs in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
One program <k>loops through all charts</k> on a sheet and changes each chart to a pie chart.
The other program changes some <k>properties of the first chart</k>.

1. Create some charts (or download the Excel file).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/programming-charts/programming-charts-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on the worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we need to declare a ChartObject object.
The ChartObject object acts as a container for a Chart object.
We call the ChartObject cht but you can use any name.
Dim cht As ChartObject

2. The ChartObjects collection contains all the embedded charts on a single sheet.
We want to loop through all charts on the first sheet.
Add the following For Each Next loop.
For Each cht In Worksheets(1).ChartObjectsNext cht

3. The Chart object represents a chart in a workbook.
Add the following code line to the For Each Next loop to change each chart to a pie chart.
cht.Chart.ChartType = xlPie
Note: again, cht acts as a container for the Chart object.
We use the ChartType property to change the chart type.
We use the built-in constant xlPie to change each chart to a pie chart.

4. Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/programming-charts/programming-charts-result-1.png">
Now we will change some properties of the first chart.
Place another <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on the worksheet and add the following code lines:

5. The ChartObjects collection contains all the embedded charts on a single sheet.
Add the following code line to activate the first chart:
Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Activate
We can now refer to this chart as the ActiveChart.

6. Add the following code line to change the Chart title.
ActiveChart.ChartTitle.Text = "Sales Report"

7. Add the following code line to move the legend to the bottom of the chart:
ActiveChart.Legend.Position = xlBottom

8. Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/programming-charts/programming-charts-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>CurrentRegion</h2>
This example illustrates the <k>CurrentRegion property</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
The current region is a range bounded by any combination of blank rows and blank columns.
Can you find the current region of cell A1?
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/currentregion/currentregion-example-1.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Range("A1").CurrentRegion.Select
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/currentregion/currentregion-result-1.png">
Here is another example.
Can you find the current region of cell B3?
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/currentregion/currentregion-example-2.png" loading="lazy">
Code:
Range("B3").CurrentRegion.Select
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/currentregion/currentregion-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
The value 1 in row 1 has no influence on the current region of cell B3. Row 2 is empty!
<h2>Dynamic Range</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that colors the maximum value of a <k>dynamic range</k>.
Situation:
Each time we add a number and we click the command button, we want Excel VBA to color the maximum value of these numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-range/dynamic-range-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare one variable and two Range objects.
One variable of type Double we call maximum.
We call the Range objects  rng and cell.
Dim maximum As Double, rng As Range, cell As Range

2. We add the line which changes the background color of all cells to 'No Fill'.
Cells.Interior.ColorIndex = 0

3. We initialize rng with the numbers.
We use the <a href="currentregion.html">CurrentRegion</a> property for this.
CurrentRegion is useful when we don't know  the exact boundaries of a range in advance.
Set rng = Range("A1").CurrentRegion

4. We initialize maximum with the maximum value of the numbers.
We use the worksheet function Max to find the maximum value.
maximum = WorksheetFunction.Max(rng)

5. Finally, we color the maximum value.
We use a For Each Next Loop.
For Each cell In rng
If cell.Value = maximum Then cell.Interior.ColorIndex = 22Next cell
Note: instead of ColorIndex number 22 (red), you can use any ColorIndex number.

6. Add a number.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-range/dynamic-range-result.png">
<h2>Resize</h2>
<a href="#contract">Contract</a>  |  <a href="#expand">Expand</a>
The <k>Resize property</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> makes a range a specific number of rows and columns smaller or larger.
The Resize property always takes the top left cell of a range as the starting point.
<h3>Contract</h3>
To contract the size of a range, specify a smaller number of rows or columns than the original range.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Range("A1:C4").Resize(3, 2).Select
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/resize/resize-property-result-1.png">
Explanation: this code line <k>resizes</k> Range("A1:C4") to 3 rows and 2 columns and selects this range (border for illustration only).
Code line:
Range("A1:C4").Resize(, 1).Select
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/resize/resize-property-result-2.png">
Explanation: this code line resizes Range("A1:C4") to 1 column (we omit any row specification) and selects this range.
<h3>Expand</h3>
To expand the size of a range, specify a larger number of rows or columns than the original range.
Code line:
Range("A1:C4").Resize(, 5).Select
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/resize/expand-range.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: this code line resizes Range("A1:C4") to 5 columns.
The Select method selects Range("A1:E4").
Code line:
Range("A1:C4").Resize(10) = 99
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/resize/resize-number-of-rows-only.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: this code line resizes Range("A1:C4") to 10 rows.
Instead of using the Select method, you can work with the resized range directly.
For example, set the values of the cells in the resized range to 99. <h2>Entire Rows and Columns</h2>
This example teaches you how to select <k>entire rows and columns</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
Are you ready?
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. The following code line selects the entire sheet.
Cells.Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/entire-sheet.png">
Note: because we placed our command button on the first worksheet, this code line selects the entire first sheet.
To select cells on another worksheet, you have to activate this sheet first.
For example, the following code lines select the entire second worksheet.Worksheets(2).Activate

Worksheets(2).Cells.Select

2. The following code line selects the second column.
Columns(2).Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/column.png">

3. The following code line selects the seventh row.
Rows(7).Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/row.png" loading="lazy">

4. To select multiple rows, add a code line like this:
Rows("5:7").Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/multiple-rows.png" loading="lazy">

5. To select multiple columns, add a code line like this:
Columns("B:E").Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/multiple-columns.png" loading="lazy">

6. Be careful not to mix up the Row<u>s</u> and Column<u>s</u> properties with the Row and Column properties.
The Rows and Columns properties return a Range object.
The Row and Column properties return a single value.
Code line:
MsgBox Cells(5, 2).Row
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/row-property.png" loading="lazy">

7. Select cell D6. The following code line selects the entire row of the active cell.
ActiveCell.EntireRow.Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/entirerow.png" loading="lazy">
Note: border for illustration only.

8. Select cell D6. The following code line enters the value 2 into the first cell of the column that contains the active cell.
ActiveCell.EntireColumn.Cells(1).Value = 2
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/entirecolumn.png" loading="lazy">
Note: border for illustration only.

9. Select cell D6. The following code line enters the value 3 into the first cell of the row below the row that contains the active cell.
ActiveCell.EntireRow.Offset(1, 0).Cells(1).Value = 3
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/entire-rows-columns/entirerow-offset.png" loading="lazy">
Note: border for illustration only.
<h2>Offset</h2>
The <k>Offset property</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> takes the range which is a particular number of rows and columns away from a certain range.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. The Offset property below returns a range which is 3 rows below and 2 columns to the right of a range.
Range("A1:A2").Offset(3, 2).Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/offset/offset-property-result.png">
Explanation: the Select method selects this range.
The Offset property always takes the top left cell of a range as the starting point.
Border for illustration only.

2. The Offset property below returns a range which is 1 row above and 4 columns to the left of a range.
Range("F5:H5").Offset(-1, -4).Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/offset/offset-with-negative-arguments.png">

3. You can also offset by a number of rows only.
For example, return a range which is 5 rows below a range.Range("B2:D3").Offset(5).Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/offset/offset-by-rows.png" loading="lazy">

4. Finally, you can also offset by a number of columns only.
For example, return a cell which is 2 columns to the left of a cell.Range("G8").Offset(0, -2).Select
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/offset/offset-by-columns.png" loading="lazy">
For a practical example of the offset property, see our example program <a href="create-a-pattern.html">Create a Pattern</a>.<h2>From Active Cell to Last Entry</h2>
This example illustrates the End property of the Range object in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
We will use this property to select the range <k>from the Active Cell to the last entry</k> in a column.
Situation:
Some sales figures in column A.
Assume that you will be adding more sales figures over time.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/from-active-cell-to-last-entry/from-active-cell-to-last-entry-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. To select the last entry in a column, simply add the following code line:
Range("A5").End(xlDown).Select
Note: instead of Range("A5"), you can also use Range("A1"), Range("A2"), etc.
This code line is equivalent to pressing the END+DOWN ARROW.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/from-active-cell-to-last-entry/last-entry.png">

2. To select the range from cell A5 to the last entry in the column, add the following code line:
Range(Range("A5"), Range("A5").End(xlDown)).Select
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/from-active-cell-to-last-entry/from-cell-A5-to-last-entry.png" loading="lazy">

3. To select the range from the Active Cell to the last entry in the  column, simply replace Range("A5") with ActiveCell.
Range(ActiveCell, ActiveCell.End(xlDown)).Select
Result when you select cell A2 and click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/from-active-cell-to-last-entry/from-active-cell-to-last-entry.png" loading="lazy">
Note: you can use the constants xlUp, xlToRight and xlToLeft to move in the other directions.
This way you can select a range from the Active Cell to the last entry in a row.
<h2>Union and Intersect</h2>
The <k>Union method</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> returns a Range object that represents the union of two or more ranges (borders below for illustration only).
Code line:
Union(Range("B2:C7"), Range("C6:F8")).Select
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/union-intersect/union-of-two-ranges.png">
Note: the Union method doesn't return the mathematical union (cell C6 and cell C7 are included twice).
The <k>Intersect method</k> in Excel VBA returns a Range object that represents the intersection of two or more ranges (borders below for illustration only).
Code line:
Intersect(Range("B2:C7"), Range("C6:F8")).Select
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/union-intersect/intersection-of-two-ranges.png">
<h2>Test a Selection</h2>
This program in <k>Excel VBA</k> uses the Count property, IsNumeric function, IsEmpty function and Intersect method to <k>test a selection</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/test-a-selection/test-a-selection-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare two Range objects.
We call the Range objects rng and cell.
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range

2. We initialize the Range object rng with Range("C4:D10") and the Range object cell with the selected range.
Set rng = Range("C4:D10")
Set cell = Selection

3. Add the following code lines:
If cell.Count = 1 And IsNumeric(cell) And Not IsEmpty(cell) And Not Intersect(rng, cell) Is Nothing Then

MsgBox "You win"
Else

MsgBox "You lose"End If
Explanation: Intersect(rng, cell) returns a Range object that represents the <a href="union-intersect.html">intersection</a> of the two ranges.
If this range object is not Nothing, the single number (first three conditions) is in the bordered range.

4. Test the program.
Only when you select a single number in the bordered range the result will be:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/test-a-selection/test-a-selection-result-1.png">
In all other cases the result will be:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/test-a-selection/test-a-selection-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Possible Football Matches</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that shows a print preview of all the <k>possible football matches</k> from a list of teams.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/possible-football-matches/possible-football-matches-example.png">

1. First, we declare one Range object and four variables.
We call the Range object rng.
One String variable we call matchname, and three Integer variables we call counter, i and j.
Dim rng As Range, matchname As String, counter As Integer, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. We initialize rng with the team names.
We use <a href="currentregion.html">CurrentRegion</a> because we don't know the exact boundaries of the range in advance (we want this program to work for 3 teams but also for 12 teams).
We initialize counter with value 0. 
Set rng = Range("A1").CurrentRegion

counter = 0

3. We write all the possible football matches to column C.
First, we empty column C.
Worksheets(1).Columns(3) = ""

4. We start a <a href="../loop.html#double-loop">Double Loop</a>.
For i = 1 To rng.Count
For j = i + 1 To rng.Count
5. We write a matchname to the variable matchname.
matchname = rng.Cells(i).Value &amp; " vs " &amp; rng.Cells(j).Value
For example, for i = 1 and j = 2, Excel VBA writes the matchname Kickers vs Shooters.For i = 1 and j = 3, Excel VBA writes the matchname Kickers vs Little Giants, etc.
6. We write the matchname to column C.
Cells(counter + 1, 3).Value = matchname

7. The counter keeps track of the number of matchnames written to column C.
Excel VBA increments counter by 1 each time it writes a matchname to column C.
To achieve this, add the following code line:
counter = counter + 1

8. Don't forget to close the two loops.Next jNext i

9. We show a print preview of all the possible football matches.
ActiveSheet.Columns(3).PrintPreview

10. Test the program.
Part of the result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/possible-football-matches/possible-football-matches-result.png">
Note: column C is manually centered to get this result.
<h2>Font</h2>
The <k>Font property</k> of the Range object in <k>Excel VBA</k> gives access to a lot of other properties.
That is because the Font property returns an object itself; the Font object.
The Font object has many properties like the Color property and the Bold property.
<h3>Color property</h3>
To change the color of an Excel range, use the Font property of the Range object, and then the Color property of the Font object.

1. Add the following code line:
Range("A1").Font.Color = -16776961
Explanation: Where do we get this strange number from? Well, we  started the <a href="macro-recorder.html">Macro Recorder</a> and changed the color of a cell to red.
You can do this for every color!

2. The following code line gives the exact same result.
Range("A1").Font.Color = vbRed
Explanation: vbRed is a sort of built-in constant in Excel VBA.
Place your cursor on vbRed in the Visual Basic Editor and click F1 to see which other constants you can use.

3. The following code line gives the exact same result.
Range("A1").Font.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
Explanation: RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue.
These are the three primary colors.
Each component can take on a value from 0 to 255. With this function you can make every color.
RGB(255,0,0) gives the pure Red color.
<h3>Bold property</h3>
The following code line bolds a range:
Range("A1").Font.Bold = True
To unbold a range, you can use the False keyword.
The Font object has many more properties.
If you want to program these sort of things, just use the Macro Recorder to see how to do it! Usually code created by the Macro Recorder is too long.
For example, the Macro Recorder creates the following code when we bold Range("A1").<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/font/font-bold-property.png">
We have just seen that these two code lines can be written as one code line.
<h2>Background Colors</h2>
Changing <k>background colors</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> is easy.
Use the Interior property to return an Interior object.
Then use the ColorIndex property of the Interior object to set the background color of a cell.
Place three <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command buttons</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. The code line below sets the background color of cell A1 to light blue.
Range("A1").Interior.ColorIndex = 37
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/background-colors/background-color.png">

2. The following code line sets the background color of cell A1 to 'No Fill'.
Range("A1").Interior.ColorIndex = 0
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/background-colors/no-fill.png">

3. If you want to know the ColorIndex number of a color, simply ask Excel VBA.
MsgBox Selection.Interior.ColorIndex
Select cell A1 and click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/background-colors/get-colorindex-number.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/background-colors/colorindex-number.png" loading="lazy">

4. The ColorIndex property gives access to a color palette of 56 colors.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/background-colors/color-palette.png" loading="lazy">
Note: download the Excel file to see how we created this color palette.

5. If you can't find the specific color you are looking for, use the Color property and the RGB function.
Range("A1").Interior.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
Explanation: RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue.
These are the three primary colors.
Each component can take on a value from 0 to 255. With this function you can make every color.
RGB(255,0,0) gives the pure Red color (ColorIndex = 3 produces the exact same result).
<h2>Areas Collection</h2>
This example illustrates the <k>Areas collection</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
Below we have bordered Range("B2:C3,C5:E5").
This range has two areas.
The comma separates the two areas.

Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare two Range objects.
We call the Range objects rangeToUse and singleArea.
Dim rangeToUse As Range, singleArea As Range

2. We initialize the Range object rangeToUse with Range("B2:C3,C5:E5")
Set rangeToUse = Range("B2:C3,C5:E5")

3. To count the number of areas of rangeToUse, add the following code line:
MsgBox rangeToUse.Areas.Count
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/areas-collection/count-areas.png">

4. You can refer to the different areas of rangeToUse by using the index values.
The following code line counts the numbers of cells of the first area.
MsgBox rangeToUse.Areas(1).Count
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/areas-collection/count-cells-first-area.png" loading="lazy">

5. You can also loop through each area of rangeToUse and count the number of cells of each area.
The macro below does the trick.
For Each singleArea In rangeToUse.Areas
MsgBox singleArea.CountNext singleArea
Result:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/areas-collection/count-cells-second-area.png" loading="lazy">
For a practical example of the areas collection, see our example program <a href="compare-ranges.html">Compare Ranges</a>.<h2>Compare Ranges</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>compares</k> randomly selected <k>ranges</k> and highlights cells that are unique.
If you are not familiar with <a href="areas-collection.html">areas</a> yet, we highly recommend you to read this example first.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-ranges/compare-ranges-example.png">
Note: the only unique value in this example is the 3 since all other values occur in at least one more area.
To select Range("B2:B7,D3:E6,D8:E9"), hold down Ctrl and select each area.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare four Range objects and two variables of type Integer.
Dim rangeToUse As Range, singleArea As Range, cell1 As Range, cell2 As Range, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. We initialize the Range object rangeToUse with the selected range.
Set rangeToUse = Selection

3. Add the line which changes the background color of all cells to 'No Fill'.
Also add the line which removes the borders of all cells.
Cells.Interior.ColorIndex = 0

Cells.Borders.LineStyle = xlNone

4. Inform the user when he or she only selects one area.
If Selection.Areas.Count &lt;= 1 Then

MsgBox "Please select more than one area."
Else
End If
The next code lines (at 5, 6 and 7) must be added between Else and End If.

5. Color the cells of the selected areas.
rangeToUse.Interior.ColorIndex = 38

6. Border each area.
For Each singleArea In rangeToUse.Areas
singleArea.BorderAround ColorIndex:=1, Weight:=xlThinNext singleArea

7. The rest of this program looks as follows.
For i = 1 To rangeToUse.Areas.Count
For j = i + 1 To rangeToUse.Areas.Count
For Each cell1 In rangeToUse.Areas(i)
For Each cell2 In rangeToUse.Areas(j)
If cell1.Value = cell2.Value Then

cell1.Interior.ColorIndex = 0

cell2.Interior.ColorIndex = 0
End If
Next cell2
Next cell1
Next jNext i
Explanation: this may look a bit overwhelming, but it's not that difficult.
rangeToUse.Areas.Count equals 3, so the first two code lines reduce to For i = 1 to 3 and For j = i + 1 to 3. For i = 1,  j = 2, Excel VBA compares all values of the first area with all values of the second area.
For i = 1,  j = 3, Excel VBA compares all values of the first area with all values of the third area.For i = 2, j = 3, Excel VBA compares all values of the second area with all values of the third area.If  values are the same, it sets the background color of both cells to 'No Fill', because they are not unique.

<h2>Option Explicit</h2>
We strongly recommend to use <k>Option Explicit</k> at the start of your <k>Excel VBA</k> code.
Using Option Explicit forces you to declare all your variables.
For example, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:Dim myVar As Integer

myVar = 10

Range("A1").Value = mVar
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/option-explicit/without-option-explicit.png">
Clearly, cell A1 does not contain the value 10. That is because we accidentally misspelled myVar.
As a result, Excel VBA places the value of the undeclared, empty variable mVar into cell A1. 
When using Option Explicit, the code lines above generate an error because we did not declare the variable mVar.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/option-explicit/use-option-explicit.png">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/option-explicit/variable-not-defined.png" loading="lazy">

1. Click OK.
Then Click on Reset (Stop) to stop the debugger.

2. Correct mVar so that it reads myVar.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/option-explicit/with-option-explicit.png" loading="lazy">
Now you know why you should always use Option Explicit at the start of your Excel VBA code.
It avoids incorrectly typing the name of an existing variable.
Fortunately, you can instruct Excel VBA to automatically add Option Explicit.

1. In the Visual Basic Editor, click on Tools and then click on Options.

2. Check Require Variable Declaration.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/option-explicit/require-variable-declaration.png" loading="lazy">
Note: Option Explicit will not be added automatically to existing Excel files.
Simply type in Option Explicit yourself if you want to use it.
<h2>Variable Scope</h2>
The <k>scope of a variable</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> determines where that variable may be used.
You determine the scope of a variable when you declare it.
There are three scoping levels: <k>procedure level</k>, <k>module level</k>, and <k>public module level</k>.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/variable-scope-example.png">

1. Place the two procedures (a procedure is either a sub or a function) into a module.
In the Visual Basic Editor, click Insert, Module.
Add the following code lines:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/procedure-level-scope.png">

2. Result when you click the command button on the sheet (call the two subs):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/procedure-level-scope-result-1.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/procedure-level-scope-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the variable txt has scope procedure level because it is declared in the procedure (between Sub and End Sub).
As a result, you can only use this variable in sub1. The variable txt cannot be used in sub2. 

3. When you want a variable to be available to all procedures in a module, you are saying you want the variable to have module level scope.
You need to declare the variable in the General Declarations section (at the top of the module).
Slightly adjust the code as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/module-level-scope.png" loading="lazy">

4. Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/module-level-scope-result-1.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/module-level-scope-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the variable txt can now be used in sub2. Module level is used interchangeably with private module level.
That is because by default variables declared with the Dim statement in the General Declarations section are scoped as private.
You can also scope a variable as public.
Read on.

5. By using the Public keyword, your variable will be available to all procedures in all modules in a workbook.
This is called public module level scope.
Slightly adjust the code as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/variable-scope/public-module-level-scope.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: now you can create a new module and place a sub called sub3 into this module.
Use the same code as sub2. Add sub3 to your command button code.
When you click the command button on the worksheet, you will get three message boxes saying "Variable can only be used in this procedure" (see  downloadable Excel file).
<h2>Life of Variables</h2>
Sometimes you want to retain the value of a variable in <k>Excel VBA</k> when a procedure ends.
You can achieve this by using the <k>Static keyword</k>.

1. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/life-of-variables/dim-statement.png">

2. Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/life-of-variables/dim-statement-result-1.png">

3. Result when you click another time:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/life-of-variables/dim-statement-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: Excel VBA destroys the variable when the procedure ends.
Each time you click the command button on the sheet, Excel VBA creates the variable x again, adds the value 1 to it, and displays the result.

4. Now replace the keyword Dim with the keyword Static.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/life-of-variables/static-keyword.png" loading="lazy">

5. Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/life-of-variables/static-keyword-result-1.png" loading="lazy">

6. Result when you click another time:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/life-of-variables/static-keyword-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: static variables retain their values, even when a procedure ends.
Note: static variables will be destroyed when you click the Reset (Stop) button or when you close your workbook.
<h2>Type Mismatch</h2>
The <k>type mismatch error</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> occurs when you try to assign a value to a variable that isn't of the correct type.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim number As Integer

number = "bike"
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/type-mismatch/type-mismatch-error.png">
Explanation: you cannot assign a string value (bike) to a variable of type Integer.
The type mismatch error (run-time error 13) often occurs when using the InputBox function in Excel VBA.

1. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim number As Integer

number = InputBox("Enter a number", "Square Root")

MsgBox "The square root of " &amp; number &amp; " is " &amp; Sqr(number)

2. Click the command button on the sheet, enter the string value hundred and click OK.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/type-mismatch/incorrect-type.png">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/type-mismatch/type-mismatch-error.png" loading="lazy">

3. Clik End.

4. To display a friendly message instead of the <k>type mismatch error</k>, update the code as follows.
Dim number As Variant

number = InputBox("Enter a number", "Square Root")

If IsNumeric(number) Then

MsgBox "The square root of " &amp; number &amp; " is " &amp; Sqr(number)
Else

MsgBox "Please enter a number"End If
Explanation: a variable of type Variant can hold any type of value (see first line).
The IsNumeric function in Excel VBA checks if a value is a number.

5. Repeat step 2.

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<a href="#logical-operator-and">Logical Operator And</a>  |  <a href="#logical-operator-or">Logical Operator Or</a>  |  <a href="#logical-operator-not">Logical Operator Not</a>
The three most used <k>logical operators</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> are: And, Or and Not.
As always, we will use easy examples to make things more clear.
<h3>Logical Operator And</h3>
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim score1 As Integer, score2 As Integer, result As String

score1 = Range("A1").Value

score2 = Range("B1").Value

If score1 >= 60 And score2 > 1 Then

result = "pass"
Else

result = "fail"End If

Range("C1").Value = result
Explanation: if score1 is greater than or equal to 60 <u>and</u> score2 is greater than 1, Excel VBA returns pass, else Excel VBA returns fail.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/logical-operators/logical-operator-and.png">
Conclusion: Excel VBA returns fail because score2 is not greater than 1. 
<h3>Logical Operator Or</h3>
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim score1 As Integer, score2 As Integer, result As String

score1 = Range("A1").Value

score2 = Range("B1").Value

If score1 >= 60 Or score2 > 1 Then

result = "pass"
Else

result = "fail"End If

Range("C1").Value = result
Explanation: if score1 is greater than or equal to 60 <u>or</u> score2 is greater than 1, Excel VBA returns pass, else Excel VBA returns fail.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/logical-operators/logical-operator-or.png">
Conclusion: Excel VBA returns pass because score1 is greater than or equal to 60. 
<h3>Logical Operator Not</h3>
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim score1 As Integer, score2 As Integer, result As String

score1 = Range("A1").Value

score2 = Range("B1").Value

If score1 >= 60 And Not score2 = 1 Then

result = "pass"
Else

result = "fail"End If

Range("C1").Value = result
Explanation: if score1 is greater than or equal to 60 and score2 is <u>not</u> equal to 1, Excel VBA returns pass, else Excel VBA returns fail.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/logical-operators/logical-operator-not.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: Excel VBA returns fail because score2 is equal to 1. 
<h2>Select Case</h2>
Instead of multiple If Then statements in <k>Excel VBA</k>, you can use the <k>Select Case structure</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/select-case/select-case-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, declare two variables.
One variable of type Integer named score and one variable of type String named result.
Dim score As Integer, result As String

2. We initialize the variable score with the value of cell A1. 
score = Range("A1").Value

3. Add the Select Case structure.
Select Case score

Case Is >= 80

result = "very good"

Case Is >= 70

result = "good"

Case Is >= 60

result = "sufficient"

Case Else

result = "insufficient"
End Select
Explanation: Excel VBA uses the value of the variable score to test each subsequent Case statement to see if the code under the Case statement should be executed.

4. Write the value of the variable result to cell B1. 
Range("B1").Value = result

5. Test the program.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/select-case/select-case-result.png">
Note: Excel VBA executes the code under the second Case statement for all values greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80. 
<h2>Tax Rates</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that calculates the tax on an income.
The following <k>tax rates</k> apply to individuals who are residents of Australia.
<table class="gridtable">
<tr>
<th>Taxable income</th>
<th>Tax on this income</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0 - $6,000</td>
<td>Nil</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$6,001 - $35,000</td>
<td>15c for each $1 over $6,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$35,001 - $80,000</td>
<td>$4,350 plus 30c for each $1 over $35,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$80,001 - $180,000</td>
<td>$17,850 plus 38c for each $1 over $80,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$180,001 and over</td>
<td>$55,850 plus 45c for each $1 over $180,000</td>
</tr>
</table>

Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/tax-rates/tax-rates-example.png">

1. First, we declare two double variables.
One double variable we call income, and one double variable we call tax.
Dim income As Double
Dim tax As Double

2. We initialize the variable income with the value of cell A2 and round it.
income = Round(Range("A2").Value)

3. We place the rounded value into cell A2 again.
Range("A2").Value = income

4. We use the <a href="select-case.html">Select Case</a> statement to calculate the tax on an income.
Excel VBA uses income to test each subsequent Case statement to see if the code under the Case statement should be executed.
Select Case income

Case Is >= 180001

tax = 55850 + 0.45 * (income - 180000)

Case Is >= 80001

tax = 17850 + 0.38 * (income - 80000)

Case Is >= 35001

tax = 4350 + 0.3 * (income - 35000)

Case Is >= 6001

tax = 0.15 * (income - 6000)

Case Else

tax = 0
End Select
Example: if income is 37000, tax equals  4350 + 0.3 * (37000-35000) = 4350 + 600 = $4950

5. We write the value of the variable tax to cell B2. 
Range("B2").Value = tax

6. Place this code in a command button and test it.

<h2>Mod Operator</h2>
<a href="#mod-101">Mod 101</a>  |  <a href="#even-or-odd">Even or Odd</a>  |  <a href="#divisible-by-another-number">Divisible by Another Number</a>
The <k>Mod operator</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> gives the remainder of a division.
This page starts with some simple examples.
<h3>Mod 101</h3>
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
MsgBox 7 Mod 2
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/mod-operator/mod-operator-result-1.png">
Explanation: 7 divided by 2 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. 
Code line:
MsgBox 8 Mod 2
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/mod-operator/mod-operator-result-2.png">
Explanation: 8 divided by 2 equals 4 with a remainder of 0. 
<h3>Even or Odd</h3>
Let's create a program that uses the Mod operator to check if a number is even or odd.
Code lines:
Dim x As Integer

x = Range("A1").Value

If x Mod 2 = 0 Then

Range("B1").Value = "Even"
Else

Range("B1").Value = "Odd"End If
For example, enter the value 100 into cell A1 and click the command button on the sheet.Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/mod-operator/check-if-a-number-is-even-or-odd.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: a number is even if it is divisible by 2 without a remainder.
<h3>Divisible by Another Number</h3>
Let's create a program that uses the Mod operator to check if a number is divisible by another number.
Code lines:
Dim x As Integer

x = Range("A1").Value

If x Mod 4 = 0 Then

Range("B1").Value = "Divisible by 4"
Else

Range("B1").Value = "Not divisible by 4"End If
For example, enter the value 50 into cell A1 and click the command button on the sheet.Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/mod-operator/not-divisible-by-4.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: 50 divided by 4 equals 12 with a remainder of 2. In other words, 50 is not divisible by 4. 
<h2>Prime Number Checker</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>checks</k> whether a number is a <k>prime number</k> or not.
Before you start: in mathematics, a prime number  is a number that has exactly two distinct  number divisors: 1 and itself.
The smallest twenty-five prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89 and 97. For example, 8 has 1, 2, 4 and 8 as divisors and is <u>not</u> a prime number.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/prime-number-checker/prime-number-checker-example.png">

1. First, we declare three variables.
One Integer variable we call divisors, one Long variable we call number and one Long variable we call i.
We use Long variables here because Long variables have larger capacity than Integer variables.
Dim divisors As Integer, number As Long, i As Long

2. We initialize two variables.
We initialize the variable divisors with value 0. We use the InputBox function to get a number from the user.
divisors = 0

number = InputBox("Enter a number")
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/prime-number-checker/enter-number.png">
After the user has entered a number, we want to check whether this number is a prime number or not.
Remember, a prime number has exactly two distinct  number divisors: 1 and itself.

3. We start a For Next loop.
For i = 1 To number
4. Now comes the most important part of the program.
To calculate the number of divisors of a number, we use the Mod operator.
The Mod operator gives the remainder of a division.
For example, 7 mod 2 = 1 because 7 divided by 2 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. Only if 'number mod i' = 0, i is a divisor of number.In this case we want to increment the variable divisors by 1. The macro below does the trick.
If number Mod i = 0 Then

divisors = divisors + 1End If
Excel VBA checks this for i = 1, i = 2, i = 3, i = 4 until i = number.
Note that i = 1 and i = number always are divisors of number.
Only if these numbers are the only divisors of  number, the number is a prime number.

5. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i

6. If divisors equals 2, we display a msgbox saying that the entered number is a prime number.
If the number of divisors is higher than 2, we display a msgbox saying that the entered number is not a prime number.
If divisors = 2 Then

MsgBox number &amp; " is a prime number"
Else

MsgBox number &amp; " is not a prime number"End If

7. Test the program.
Result for 104729:

<h2>Find Second Highest Value</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>finds the second highest value</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/find-second-highest-value/find-second-highest-value-example.png">

1. First, we declare two Range objects and two variables of type Double.
We call the Range objects rng and cell.
One double variable we call highestValue, and one double variable we call secondHighestValue.
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range
Dim highestValue As Double, secondHighestValue As Double

2. We initialize the Range object rng with the selected range and the two Double variables with value 0. 
Set rng = Selection

highestValue = 0

secondHighestValue = 0

3. First, we want to find the highest value.
We want to check each cell in a randomly selected range (this range can be of any size).
In Excel VBA, you can use the For Each Next loop for this.
Add the following code lines:
'Find Highest Value
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: rng and cell are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.
The green line is a comment and is only added here to provide information about this piece of code.

4. We check each cell in this range.
If it's higher than highestValue, we write the value to the variable highestValue.
Add the following code line to the loop.
If cell.Value > highestValue Then highestValue = cell.Value
Note: the first value is always higher than highestValue because the starting value of highestValue is 0. 

5. Second, we want to find the second highest Value.
We add another For Each Next loop.
'Find Second Highest Value
For Each cell In rngNext cell

6. We check each cell in the selected range again.
If it's higher than secondHighestValue and lower than highestValue, we write the value to the variable secondHighestValue.
Add the following code line to the loop.
If cell.Value > secondHighestValue And cell.Value &lt; highestValue Then secondHighestValue = cell.Value

7. Finally, we display the second highest value using a MsgBox.
MsgBox "Second Highest Value is " &amp; secondHighestValue

8. Place your macro in a command button, select the numbers, and click on the command button.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/find-second-highest-value/find-second-highest-value-result.png">
Note: understanding If Then statements and loops in Excel VBA is important if you want to write more complicated programs in the future.
However, in this example, you can also use <a href="../application-object.html#worksheetfunction">WorksheetFunction</a>.Large to quickly find the second highest value.

9. The following code line produces the exact same result:
MsgBox "Second Highest Value is " &amp; WorksheetFunction.Large(Range("A1:A11"), 2)
Note: use the value 3 to find the third highest value, the value 4 to find the fourth highest value, etc.
<h2>Sum by Color</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>sums numbers by color</k>.
Situation:
You have lent money to two twelve people.
Some people have given it back (in black) and some still owe you money (red).
You want to know how much money you still receive.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sum-by-color/sum-by-color-example.png">

1. First, we declare two variables of type Integer.
One named toReceive and one named i.
We initialize the variable toReceive with value 0. 
Dim toReceive As Integer, i As
Integer

toReceive = 0

2. Second, we start a For Next loop.
For i = 1 To 12
3. We now check each number and only if the color of the number is red we add the number to toReceive.
If Cells(i, 1).Font.Color = vbRed Then

toReceive = toReceive + Cells(i, 1).ValueEnd If

4. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i

5. Finally, we display the money still to receive.
We use the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) two strings.
Although toReceive is not a string it works here.
MsgBox "Still to receive " &amp; toReceive &amp; " dollars"

6. Place your macro in a command button and test it.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sum-by-color/sum-by-color-result.png">
<h2>Delete Blank Cells</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>deletes blank cells</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/delete-blank-cells/delete-blank-cells-example.png">

1. First, we declare two variables of type Integer.
One named counter and one named i.
We initialize the variable counter with value 0. 
Dim counter As Integer, i As Integer

counter = 0

2. Next, we check for each cell whether it is empty or not (&lt;> means not equal to).
We are using a loop for this.
If not empty, we write the value to column B.
The counter holds track of the number of cells that have been copied to column B.
Each time we copy a value to column B, we increment counter by 1. This piece of the program looks as follows:
For i = 1 To 10
If Cells(i, 1).Value &lt;> "" Then

Cells(counter + 1, 2).Value = Cells(i, 1).Value

counter = counter + 1
End IfNext i
Result so far:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/delete-blank-cells/write-non-empty-cells-to-next-column.png">

3. Finally, we empty Range("A1:A10"), copy the values of column B to column A, and empty Range("B1:B10").
Range("A1:A10").Value = ""

Range("A1:A10").Value = Range("B1:B10").Value

Range("B1:B10") = ""

<h2>Loop through Defined Range</h2>
Below we will look at a program that <k>loops through a defined range</k>.
For example, when we want to square the numbers in Range("A1:A3").Did you know you can also loop through a <a href="dynamic-range.html">dynamic range</a>?
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-defined-range/loop-through-defined-range-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare two Range objects.
We call the Range objects rng and cell.
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range

2. We initialize the Range object rng with Range("A1:A3").
Set rng = Range("A1:A3")

3. Add the For Each Next loop.
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: rng and cell are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.

4. Next, we square each cell in this range.
To achieve this, add the following code line to the loop:
cell.Value = cell.Value * cell.Value
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-defined-range/loop-through-defined-range-result.png">

5. If you want to check each cell in a randomly selected range, simply replace:
Set rng = Range("A1:A3")
with:
Set rng = Selection

6. Now, for example select Range("A1:A2").
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-defined-range/loop-through-selection-example.png" loading="lazy">
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-defined-range/loop-through-selection-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Loop through Entire Column</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>loops through the entire first column</k> and colors all values that are lower than a certain value.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-entire-column/loop-through-entire-column-example-1.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-entire-column/loop-through-entire-column-example-2.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, declare a variable called i of type Long.
We use a variable of type Long here because Long variables have larger capacity than Integer variables.
Dim i As Long

2. Next, add the code line which changes the font color of all the cells in column A to black.
Columns(1).Font.Color = vbBlack

3. Add the loop.
For i = 1 To Rows.CountNext i
Note: worksheets can have up to 1,048,576 rows in Excel 2007 or later.
No matter what version you are using, the code line above loops through all rows.

4. Next, we color all values that are lower than the value entered into cell D2. Empty cells are ignored.
Add the following code lines to the loop.
If Cells(i, 1).Value &lt; Range("D2").Value And Not IsEmpty(Cells(i, 1).Value) Then

Cells(i, 1).Font.Color = vbRedEnd If
Result when you click the command button on the sheet (this may take a while):
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-entire-column/loop-through-entire-column-result-1.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loop-through-entire-column/loop-through-entire-column-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Do Until Loop</h2>
Although not used very often on this site, you might find yourself in a situation where you want to use the <k>Do Until Loop</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
Code placed between Do Until and Loop will be repeated until the part after Do Until is true.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim i As Integer

i = 1
Do Until i > 6
Cells(i, 1).Value = 20
i = i + 1Loop

Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/do-until-loop/do-until-loop.png">
Explanation: until i is higher than 6, Excel VBA places the value 20 into the cell at the intersection of row i and column 1 and increments i by 1. As a result, the value 20 will be placed into column A six times (not seven because Excel VBA stops when i equals 7).
<h2>Step Keyword</h2>
You can use the <k>Step keyword</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> to specify a different increment for the counter variable of a loop.

1. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim i As Integer

For i = 1 To 6 Step 2
Cells(i, 1).Value = 100Next i
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/step-keyword/positive-step.png">
Explanation: The code lines between For and Next will be executed three times.
For i = 1, Excel VBA enters the value 100 into the cell at the intersection of row 1 and column 1. When Excel VBA reaches Next i, it increases i with 2 and jumps back to the For statement.For i = 3, Excel VBA enters the value 100 into the cell at the intersection of row 3 and column 1, etc.
2. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim j As Integer

For j = 8 To 3 Step -1
Cells(6, j).Value = 50Next j
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/step-keyword/negative-step.png">
Explanation: The code lines between For and Next will be executed six times.
For j = 8, Excel VBA enters the value 50 into the cell at the intersection of row 6 and column 8. When Excel VBA reaches Next j, it decreases j with 1 and jumps back to the For statement.For j = 7, Excel VBA enters the value 50 into the cell at the intersection of row 6 and column 7, etc.<h2>Create a Pattern</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>creates a pattern</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/create-a-pattern/create-a-pattern-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare two variables of type Integer.
One named i and one named j.
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer

2. Second, we add two For Next loops.
For i = 1 To 5 Step 2
For j = 1 To 5 Step 2
3. Next, we add the line which changes the background color of the cells to light gray.
Cells(i, j).Interior.ColorIndex = 15
Note: instead of ColorIndex number 15 (light gray), you can use any ColorIndex number.

4. Close the two For Next loops.
 Next jNext i

5. Test the program.
Result so far.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/create-a-pattern/create-a-pattern-result-so-far.png">
For example, for i = 1 and j = 1, Excel VBA colors Cells(1,1), for i = 1 and j = 3 (<a href="step-keyword.html">Step</a> 2), Excel VBA colors Cells(1,3), for i = 1 and j = 5, Excel VBA colors Cells(1,5), for i = 3 (Step 2) and j = 1, Excel VBA colors Cells(3,1), etc.
6. We are almost there.
The only thing we need to do, is color the cells which are <a href="offset.html">offset</a> by 1 row below and 1 column to the right of the cells already colored.
Add the following code line to the loop.
Cells(i, j).Offset(1, 1).Interior.ColorIndex = 15

7. Test the program.
Result:

<h2>Sort Numbers</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>sorts numbers</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sort-numbers/sort-numbers-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare three variables of type Integer and one Range object.
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, temp As Integer, rng As Range

2. We initialize the Range object rng with the numbers in column A.
We use the <a href="currentregion.html">CurrentRegion</a> property for this.
CurrentRegion is useful when we don't know  the exact boundaries of a range in advance (we want this program to work for 9 numbers but also for 90 numbers).
Set rng = Range("A1").CurrentRegion

3. We start two For Next loops.
For i = 1 To rng.Count
For j = i + 1 To rng.CountExplanation: rng.Count equals 9, so the first two code lines reduce to For i = 1 to 9 and For j = i + 1 to 9. For i = 1, j = 2, 3, ...
, 8 and 9 are checked.

4. To sort the numbers properly, we compare the first number with the next number.
If the next number is smaller, we swap the numbers.
Add the following If Then statement.
If rng.Cells(j) &lt; rng.Cells(i) Then
End If
If the above statement is true, we swap the numbers.
For example: for i = 1 and j = 2, the numbers 2 and 10 are being compared.The above statement is not true.
Thus, no need to swap the numbers.
Excel VBA increments j by 1 and repeats the code lines for i = 1 and j = 3. You can easily see that 5 is larger than 2, so still no need to swap the numbers.
We get the same result for j = 4, j = 5 and j = 6. When we arrive at j = 7, the above statement is true since 1 is smaller than 2. 

5. We <a href="swap-values.html">swap</a> the numbers.
We temporarily store one number to temp, so that Excel VBA can swap the numbers properly.
Add the following code lines in the If statement.
'swap numbers

temp = rng.Cells(i)

rng.Cells(i) = rng.Cells(j)

rng.Cells(j) = temp

6. We close the second For Next loop (Outside the If statement).Next j
For i = 1 and j = 7, Excel VBA swapped the numbers.That means  we get 1 at the first position and 2 at position 7. Now that we have 1 at the first position, we will compare this value with 5 (for j = 8) and 4 (for j = 9).
There is no need to swap the numbers (1 is the smallest number).
This way Excel VBA gets (for i = 1) the smallest number at the first position.
To get the second smallest number at the second position, Excel VBA repeats the exact same steps for i = 2. To get the third smallest number at the third position, Excel VBA repeats the exact same steps for i = 3, etc.

7. Close the first For Next loop (Outside the If statement).Next i

8. Test your program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sort-numbers/sort-numbers-result.png">
Note: this program is a great exercise.
Understanding loops in Excel VBA is essential if you want to write more complicated programs in the future! Having said that, you can also use the Sort method in Excel VBA to quickly sort numbers.

9. The following code line produces the exact same result:
Range("A1:A9").Sort Key1:=Range("A1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Header:=xlNo
Note: use xlDescending to sort in descending order.
Use Header:=xlYes if your data has headers.

10. Bonus.
Use extra keys to sort on multiple columns.
Example code line:
Range("A1:B9").Sort Key1:=Range("A1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Key2:=Range("B1"), Order2:=xlDescending, Header:=xlYes
<h2>Randomly Sort Data</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>randomly sorts data</k> (in this example randomly sorts names).
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/randomly-sort-data/randomly-sort-data-example.png">

1. First, we declare four variables.
One variable of type String we call TempString, one variable of type Integer we call TempInteger, one variable of type Integer we call i, and one variable of type Integer we call j.
Dim tempString As String, tempInteger As Integer, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. We write 5 random numbers to column B (one for each name).
We use the worksheet function RandBetween for this.
For i = 1 To 5
Cells(i, 2).Value = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(0, 1000)Next i
Result so far:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/randomly-sort-data/randomly-sort-data-result-so-far.png">
We will use the numbers next to each name to sort the names.
The name with the lowest number first, the name with the second lowest number, second, etc.

3. We start a <a href="../loop.html#double-loop">Double Loop</a>.
For i = 1 To 5
For j = i + 1 To 5
4. Add the following code line:
If Cells(j, 2).Value &lt; Cells(i, 2).Value Then
Example: for i = 1 and j = 2, Wendy and Richard are compared.
Because Richard has a lower number, we swap  Wendy and Richard.
Richard is at the first position now.
For i = 1 and j = 3, Richard and Joost are compared.Joost has a higher number so nothing happens.
This way, Excel VBA gets the name with the lowest number at the first position.
For i = 2, Excel VBA gets the name with the second lowest number at the second position, etc.
5. If true, we <a href="swap-values.html">swap</a> the names.
tempString = Cells(i, 1).Value

Cells(i, 1).Value = Cells(j, 1).Value

Cells(j, 1).Value = tempString

6. And we swap the numbers.
tempInteger = Cells(i, 2).Value

Cells(i, 2).Value = Cells(j, 2).Value

Cells(j, 2).Value = tempInteger

7. Don't forget to close the If statement.End If

8. Don't forget to close the two loops.
 Next jNext i

9. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/randomly-sort-data/randomly-sort-data-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: you can add a line which deletes the numbers in column B.
It's even nicer to place the numbers of each name in an array, so no numbers are placed on your worksheet.
However, for illustrative purpose we've chosen to place the values on the sheet.
<h2>Remove Duplicates</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>removes duplicates</k>.
Situation:
In column A we have 10 numbers.
We want to remove the duplicates from these numbers and place the unique numbers in column B.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/remove-duplicates/remove-duplicates-example.png">

1. First, we declare four variables.
toAdd of type Boolean, uniqueNumbers of type Integer, i of type Integer, and j of type Integer.
Dim toAdd As Boolean, uniqueNumbers As Integer, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. Next, we write the first number of column A to column B since the first number is always 'unique'.
Cells(1, 2).Value = Cells(1, 1).Value

3. We initialize two variables.
We've just added one number to column B, so we initialize uniqueNumbers with the value 1. We set toAdd to True assuming that the next number needs to be added as well (this is not necessarily true of course).
uniqueNumbers = 1

toAdd = True
We need to determine whether the second number is 'unique' or not.
This can be done in a very easy way.
Only if the number is not already in column B, the second number needs to be added to column B.

4. We also need to check this for the third number, fourth number, and so on.
We start a <a href="../loop.html">For Next loop</a> for this.
For i = 2 To 10
5. Now comes the most important part of the program.
If the second number is equal to one of the numbers in column B (so far we only have one unique number), we set toAdd to False because in this case we don't want to add this number! (it is not 'unique').
At the moment uniqueNumbers is still equal to 1, but uniqueNumbers can be a whole list.
To check this whole list, we need another For Next loop.
Again: if the number we want to add is equal to one of the numbers in this list, toAdd will be set to False and the number will not be added.
Add the following code lines:
For j = 1 To uniqueNumbers
If Cells(i, 1).Value = Cells(j, 2).Value Then

toAdd = False
End IfNext j

6. Only if toAdd is still True and not set to False, Excel VBA needs to add the number to column B.
At the same time, we increment uniqueNumbers by 1 because we have one unique number more now.
The following code lines get the job done:
If toAdd = True Then

Cells(uniqueNumbers + 1, 2).Value = Cells(i, 1).Value

uniqueNumbers = uniqueNumbers + 1End If

7. Finally, we set toAdd to True assuming the next number (third number) needs to be added.
Again this is not necessarily true.
toAdd = True

8. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i

9. Place your macro in a command button and test it.

<h2>Complex Calculations</h2>
The k<sup>th</sup> term, T<sub>k</sub>, of a certain mathematical series is defined by the following formula:

Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>calculates</k> any term T<sub>k</sub> and summation of terms up to N.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/complex-calculations/complex-calculations-example.png">
Explanation: the user has the option to enter "All" or "Odd", to respectively calculate the sum of the first N terms of the series or the sum of only the odd terms up to N.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare four variables of type Integer and one variable of type String.
Dim i As Integer, term As Integer, N As Integer, stepSize As Integer
Dim sumType As String

2. Second, we initialize the variables.
i = 0

N = Range("C2").Value

sumType = Range("C3").Value

3. Empty the fields.
Range("A8:B1000").Value = ""

Range("C6").Value = ""

4. Determine stepSize.
Select Case sumType

Case Is = "All"

stepSize = 1

Case Is = "Odd"

stepSize = 2

Case Else

MsgBox "Enter a valid expression in cell C3"

<h2>Knapsack Problem</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>solves</k> a small instance of a <k>knapsack problem</k>.
Definition: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the items to include in a collection so that the total value is as large as possible and the total weight is less than a given limit.
It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most useful items.
Example: 5 items with weights, values and limit as given.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/knapsack-problem/knapsack-problem-image.jpg">
In Excel this problem looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/knapsack-problem/knapsack-problem-example.png">

1. First, we declare five variables of type Double with names limit, weight, value, totalWeight and maximumValue.
Dim limit As Double, weight As Double, value As Double, totalWeight As Double, maximumValue As Double

2. Next, we declare five variables of type Integer with with names i, j, k, l, m.
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, k As Integer, l As Integer, m As Integer

3. We initialize two variables.
We initialize the variable limit with the value of cell D6. We initialize the variable maximumValue with value 0. 
limit = Range("D6").value

maximumValue = 0

4. Next, we check each possible solution.
We can either include an item (1) or leave it out (0).
We start 5 For Next loops.
One for each item.
For i = 0 To 1
For j = 0 To 1
For k = 0 To 1
For l = 0 To 1
For m = 0 To 1
5. We calculate the weight and the value of a possible solution.
weight = 12 * i + 2 * j + 1 * k + 1 * l + 4 * m

value = 4 * i + 2 * j + 2 * k + 1 * l + 10 * m

6. Only if value is higher than maximumValue and weight is lower than limit, we've found a new better solution.
If value > maximumValue And weight &lt;= limit Then

7. If true, we write the new solution to row 4, weight to totalWeight and value to maximumValue.
Range("B4").value = i

Range("C4").value = j

Range("D4").value = k

Range("E4").value = l

Range("F4").value = m

totalWeight = weight

maximumValue = value

8. Don't forget to close the If statement.End If

9. Don't forget to close the 5 For Next loops.Next m
Next l
Next k
Next jNext i
Excel VBA checks each possible solution this way and as a result the optimal solution will appear in row 4. Remember, 1 means we include an item, 0 means we leave it out.

10. Finally, write totalWeight and maximumValue of the optimal solution to respectively cell B6 and B8. 
Range("B6").value = totalWeight

Range("B8").value = maximumValue

11. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/knapsack-problem/knapsack-problem-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: it's optimal to include the last four items with a maximum value of 15. This solution with a total weight of 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 does not exceed the limit of 15. 
Note: by making the weights and values variable you can solve any knapsack problem of this size (see  downloadable Excel file).
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<a href="#single-step">Single Step</a>  |  <a href="#breakpoint">Breakpoint</a>
This example teaches you how to <k>debug code</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
<h3>Single Step</h3>
By pressing F8, you can single step through your code.
The is very useful because it allows you to see the effect of each code line on your worksheet.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer

For i = 1 To 2
For j = 1 To 5
Cells(i, j).Value = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(20, 100)
Next jNext i
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/debugging/without-debugging.png">

1. Empty the range A1:E2. 

2. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and reduce the size of the screen so that you can see the Visual Basic Editor and worksheet at the same time.

3. In the Visual Basic Editor, place your cursor before Private and press F8. 
The first line turns yellow.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/debugging/single-step-1.png">

4. Press F8 four times.
For i = 1 and j = 1, Excel VBA enters a random number between 20 and 100 into the cell at the intersection of row 1 and column 1. By holding the cursor steady on a variable, you can see the value of the variable.<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/debugging/single-step-2.png" loading="lazy">

5. Press F8 two more times.
For i = 1 and j = 2, Excel VBA enters a random number between 20 and 100 into the cell at the intersection of row 1 and column 2. <img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/debugging/single-step-3.png" loading="lazy">

6. Single step through the rest of the code to see how Excel VBA enters the other numbers.
This is an excellent way to learn how a loop works.
If you wish to stop the program, click the Reset (Stop) button.
<h3>Breakpoint</h3>
You set a breakpoint to halt execution at a specific code line.

1. Empty the range A1:E2. 

2. To set a breakpoint, click on the left margin (in grey) where you want to place the breakpoint.
A red dot appears.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/debugging/set-breakpoint.png" loading="lazy">

3. Click on the green arrow to execute the macro until the breakpoint.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/debugging/continue-execution.png" loading="lazy">
Only part of the macro (for i = 1) has been executed.

4. To remove the breakpoint, click on the red dot.
Next, click on the green arrow to continue execution.
If you receive a macro from someone else, remember, debugging is great way to understand the code.
You can easily see the effect of each code line on your worksheet.
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
Below we will look at two programs in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
One program simply <k>ignores errors</k>.
The other program <k>continues execution at a specified line</k> upon hitting an error.
Situation:
Both programs calculate the <a href="../../examples/square-root.html">square root</a> of numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/error-handling/error-handlig.png">
<h3>Square Root 1</h3>
Add the following code lines to the 'Square Root 1' command button.

1. First, we declare two Range objects.
We call the Range objects rng and cell.
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range

2. We initialize the Range object rng with the selected range.
Set rng = Selection

3. We want to calculate the square root of each cell in a randomly selected range (this range can be of any size).
In Excel VBA, you can use the For Each Next loop for this.
Add the following code lines:
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: rng and cell are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.

4. Add the following code line to the loop.
On Error Resume Next

5. Next, we calculate the square root of a value.
In Excel VBA, we can use the Sqr function for this.
Add the following code line to the loop.
cell.Value = Sqr(cell.Value)

6. Exit the Visual Basic Editor and test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/error-handling/on-error-resume-next-result.png">
Conclusion: Excel VBA has ignored cells containing invalid values such as negative numbers and text.
Without using the 'On Error Resume Next' statement you would get two errors.
Be careful to only use the 'On Error Resume Next' statement when you are sure ignoring errors is OK.
<h3>Square Root 2</h3>
Add the following code lines to the  'Square Root 2' command button.

1. The same program as Square Root 1 but replace 'On Error Resume Next' with:
On Error GoTo InvalidValue:
Note: InvalidValue is randomly chosen here, you can use any name.
Remember to refer to this name in the rest of your code.

2. Outside the For Each Next loop, first add the following code line:
Exit Sub
Without this line, the rest of the code (error code) will be executed, even if there is no error!

3. Excel VBA continues execution at the line starting with 'InvalidValue:'  upon hitting an error (don't forget the colon).
Add the following code line:
InvalidValue:

4. We keep our error code simple for now.
We display a MsgBox with some text and the address of the cell where the error occurred.
MsgBox "can't calculate square root at cell " &amp; cell.Address

5. Add the following line to instruct Excel VBA to resume execution after executing the error code.
Resume Next

6. Exit the Visual Basic Editor and test the program.
Result:

<h2>Err Object</h2>
If you are not familiar with <a href="error-handling.html">Error Handling</a> yet, we highly recommend you to read this example first.
When an error in <k>Excel VBA</k> occurs, the properties of the <k>Err object</k> are filled with information.
Situation:
The program below calculates the <a href="../../examples/square-root.html">square root</a> of numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/err-object/err-object-example.png">

1. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range
Set rng = Selection

For Each cell In rng
On Error GoTo InvalidValue:

cell.Value = Sqr(cell.Value)Next cell

Exit Sub

InvalidValue:

MsgBox Err.Number &amp; " " &amp; Err.Description &amp; " at cell " &amp; cell.Address

Resume Next
Result when you select Range("B2:B6") and click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/err-object/err-object-result-1.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/err-object/err-object-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: when an error occurs, the number property of the Err object is filled with an unique error number of the current error and the Description property is filled with the error description of the current error.

2. These descriptions may not be very helpful to the users of your program.
You can make the error messages more user friendly by modifying the last part of the macro as follows:
InvalidValue:

Select Case Err.Number

Case Is = 5

MsgBox "Can't calculate square root of negative number at cell " &amp; cell.Address

Case Is = 13

MsgBox "Can't calculate square root of text at cell " &amp; cell.Address
End Select

Resume Next

<h2>Interrupt a Macro</h2>
You can <k>interrupt a macro</k> in <k>Excel</k> at any time by pressing Esc or Ctrl + Break.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim x As Long

x = 5

Do While x > 2

x = x + 1Loop

1. Click the command button on the sheet.
This macro  never stops because the part after 'Do While' will always be true (x will always be higher than 2).

2. To halt this infinite loop, press Esc or Ctrl + Break.
The following dialog box will appear:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/interrupt-a-macro/code-interrupted-dialog-box.png">

3. Click End to end the macro, click Debug to take a look at the macro in the Visual Basic Editor.

4. Add the following code line at the start of your code if you don't want users of your program to be able to interrupt your macro (not recommended).
Application.EnableCancelKey = xlDisabled

5. Although Excel VBA resets the EnableCancelKey property automatically to xlInterrupt at the end of your macro, it's good practice (when using the previous code line) to end your macro with the following code line:
Application.EnableCancelKey = xlInterrupt
Note: if Excel freezes and you cannot interrupt your macro anymore, press Ctrl + Alt + Delete and close Excel.
<h2>Subscript Out of Range</h2>
<a href="#workbooks">Workbooks</a>  |  <a href="#worksheets">Worksheets</a>  |  <a href="#array">Array</a>
The '<k>subscript out of range</k>' error in <k>Excel VBA</k> occurs when you refer to a nonexistent collection member or a nonexistent array element.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the code lines below.
To execute the code lines, click the command button on the sheet.
<h3>Workbooks</h3>
The Workbooks collection in Excel VBA contains all the Workbook objects that are currently open.

1. The code line below closes sales.xlsm.
Workbooks("sales.xlsm").Close
Result when there's no open workbook with this name:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/subscript-out-of-range/subscript-out-of-range-error.png">
Note: to fix this 'subscript out of range' error (<k>run-time error 9</k>), open sales.xlsm before clicking the command button.
<h3>Worksheets</h3>
The Worksheets collection in Excel VBA contains all the Worksheet objects in a workbook.
Our workbook has 3 worksheets.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/subscript-out-of-range/worksheets-collection.png">

1. The code line below tries to place the word Hello into cell A1 on the 4th worksheet.
Worksheets(4).Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/subscript-out-of-range/subscript-out-of-range-error.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the 'subscript out of range' error pops up because there's no 4th worksheet.
To fix this error, change the 4 to a 1, 2 or 3 (or insert a new worksheet by clicking the plus sign).
<h3>Array</h3>
An <a href="../array.html">array</a> is a group of variables.
In Excel VBA, you can refer to a specific variable (element) of an array by using the array name and the index number.

1. The first code line below declares a String array with name Films.
The array consists of five elements.

2. Next, we initialize each element of the array.

3. The final code line tries to display the 6th element using a MsgBox.
Dim Films(1 To 5) As String

Films(1) = "Lord of the Rings"

Films(2) = "Speed"

Films(3) = "Star Wars"

Films(4) = "The Godfather"

Films(5) = "Pulp Fiction"

MsgBox Films(6)
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/subscript-out-of-range/subscript-out-of-range-error.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the 'subscript out of range' error pops up because there's no 6th element.
To fix this error, change the 6 to a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 (or declare a String array with 6 elements).
<h2>Macro Comments</h2>
  
A <k>macro comment</k> is a piece of text in a macro which will not be executed by <k>Excel VBA</k>.
It is only there to provide you information about the macro.
To insert a comment, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

2. To let Excel VBA know that you want to insert a comment, precede the text with an apostrophe.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-comments/macro-comment.png">
Note: Excel VBA colors the line green to indicate that it's a comment.
Comments become more useful as program size increases.
You can also convert multiple code lines to comments temporarily.
Sometimes this is easier than deleting and rewriting them.

3. First, display the Edit toolbar.
Click View, Toolbars, Edit.

4. Select the code lines.

5. Click the Comment Block button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/macro-comments/comment-block-button.png">
Note: To remove the apostrophes, select the code lines and click the Uncomment Block button next to the Comment Block button.
<h2>Separate Strings</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>separates strings</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/separate-strings/separate-strings-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare a variable called fullname of type String, a variable called commaposition of type Integer, and a variable called i of type Integer.
Dim fullname As String, commaposition As Integer, i As Integer
The problem we are dealing with is that we need to tell Excel VBA where we want to separate the string.
In case of Smith, Mike the comma is at position 6 while in case of Williams, Janet the comma is at position 9. 

2. We use a loop to execute the operations on each name entered in Excel.
First, we initialize the variable fullname.
Next, we use the Instr function to find the position of the comma.
For i = 2 To 7
fullname = Cells(i, 1).Value

commaposition = InStr(fullname, ",")

3. Finally, we want to write the part after the comma to column B and the part in front of the comma to column C.
You can achieve this by adding the lines:
Cells(i, 2).Value = Mid(fullname, commaposition + 2)

Cells(i, 3).Value = Left(fullname, commaposition - 1)
Mid(fullname, commaposition + 2) means we want the part of fullname starting at character 'commaposition + 2' (this is exactly the first name).
Left(fullname, commaposition - 1) means we want the part of fullname starting at the beginning until character 'commaposition- 1' (this is exactly the last name).

4. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i

5. Add six names separated by a comma and space to Range("A2:A7").

6. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/separate-strings/separate-strings-result.png">
<h2>Reverse Strings</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that can <k>reverse strings</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/reverse-strings/reverse-string-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare four variables.
One variable called text of type String, one variable called reversedText also of type String, one variable called length of type Integer, and one variable called i of type Integer.
Dim text As String, reversedText As String, length As Integer, i As Integer

2. We initialize two variables.
We use the InputBox function to get a text string from the user.
We use the Len function in Excel VBA to get the length of a string.
text = InputBox("Enter the text you want to reverse")

length = Len(text)
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/reverse-strings/enter-text.png">

3. We start a For Next loop.
For i = 0 To length - 1
4. Now comes the simple trick.
We take the last character from text and place it at the front of ReversedText.
We can use the Mid function in Excel VBA to extract a character from a string.
We use the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) two strings.
reversedText = reversedText &amp; Mid(text, (length - i), 1)

5. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i
Example: text = "Car".
The length of text is 3. For i = 0 to 2, we extract the substring of text starting at position length - i with length 1. Thus, for i = 0, Mid(text, 3, 1) equals r.
We place r at the first position of reversedText.
For i = 1, Mid(text, 2, 1) equals a.We add a to reversedText which becomes ra.
For i = 2, Mid(text, 1, 1) equals C.We add C to reversedText which becomes raC.

6. Finally, we display reversedText using a MsgBox.
msgbox reversedText

7. Test the program.
Result:

<h2>Convert to Proper Case</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>converts text to proper case</k>.
That is, the first letter in each word in uppercase, and all other letters in lowercase.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/convert-to-proper-case/convert-to-proper-case-example.png">

1. First, we declare two Range objects.
We call the Range objects rng and cell.
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range

2. We initialize the Range object rng with the selected range.
Set rng = Selection

3. We want to check each cell in a randomly selected range (this range can be of any size).
In Excel VBA, you can use the For Each Next loop for this.
Add the following code lines:
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: rng and cell are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.

4. To ignore a  cell that contains a formula, add the following code line between For Each and Next (only if cell.HasFormula is false we continue).
If Not cell.HasFormula Then
End If

5. Next, we want to convert each word  in this range to 'proper case'.
You can use the worksheet function Proper for this task.
Add the following code line in your if statement.
cell.Value = WorksheetFunction.Proper(cell.Value)

6. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/convert-to-proper-case/convert-to-proper-case-result.png">
<h2>Instr</h2>
<a href="#simple-instr-function">Simple Instr Function</a>  |  <a href="#start-position">Start Position</a>  |  <a href="#zero">Zero</a>  |  <a href="#instr-and-if">Instr and If</a>  |  <a href="#case-insensitive-search">Case-insensitive Search</a>
Use <k>Instr</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> to find the position of a substring in a string.
The Instr function is quite versatile.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the code lines below.
To execute the code lines, click the command button on the sheet.
<h3>Simple Instr Function</h3>
By default, the Instr function starts searching at the beginning of the string (position 1).
Code:
Dim state As String

state = "Virginia"

MsgBox InStr(state, "gin")
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/instr-result.png">
Note: string "gin" found at position 4. 
<h3>Start Position</h3>
The second Instr function below starts searching at position 7. 
Code:
Dim state As String

state = "South Carolina"

MsgBox InStr(state, "o")

MsgBox InStr(7, state, "o")
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/position-2.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/position-10.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the first Instr function finds the string "o" at position 2. The second Instr function starts searching at position 7 and finds the string "o" at position 10. 
<h3>Zero</h3>
The Instr function returns 0 if the string is not found (important as we will see next).
Code:
Dim state As String

state = "Florida"

MsgBox InStr(state, "us")
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/zero-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: string "us" not found.
<h3>Instr and If</h3>
Let's create a simple VBA program that uses the <k>Instr function</k>.
Code:
Dim state As String, substring As String

state = Range("A2").Value

substring = Range("B2").Value

If InStr(state, substring) > 0 Then

Range("C2").Value = "Found"
Else

Range("C2").Value = "Not Found"End If
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/instr-and-if.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: string "outh" found at position 2. The Instr function returns 2. As a result, Excel VBA places the string "Found" into cell C2. 
<h3>Case-insensitive Search</h3>
By default, the Instr function performs a case-sensitive search.
Enter the string "dakota" into cell B2 and click the command button on the sheet.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/case-sensitive-search.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: string "dakota" not found (first letter not capitalized).
The Instr function returns 0. As a result, Excel VBA places the string "Not Found" into cell C2. 
To perform a case-insensitive search, update the code as follows:
Dim state As String, substring As String

state = Range("A2").Value

substring = Range("B2").Value

If InStr(1, state, substring, vbTextCompare) > 0 Then

Range("C2").Value = "Found"
Else

Range("C2").Value = "Not Found"End If
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/instr/case-insensitive-search.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the Instr function shown above has 4 arguments.
To perform a case-insensitive search, always specify a start position (first argument) and use vbTextCompare (fourth argument).
<h2>Count Words</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>counts the number of words</k> in a selected range.
One or more spaces are assumed to separate words.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/count-words/count-words-example.png">

1. First, we declare two Range objects and three variables.
We call the Range objects rng and cell.
One Integer variable we call cellWords, one Integer variable we call totalWords, and one String variable we call content.
Dim rng As Range, cell As Range
Dim cellWords As Integer, totalWords As Integer, content As String

2. We initialize the Range object rng with the selected range and the two variables of type Integer with value 0. 
Set rng = Selection

cellWords = 0

totalWords = 0

3. We want to check each cell in a randomly selected range (this range can be of any size).
In Excel VBA, you can use the For Each Next loop for this.
Add the following code lines:
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: rng and cell are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.

4. Next, we determine for each cell in this range how many words it contains.
To ignore a cell that contains a formula, add the following code line between For Each and Next (only if cell.HasFormula is false we continue).
If Not cell.HasFormula Then
End If

5. First, we write the content of the cell to the variable content.
Next, we remove the spaces at the beginning and the end (if there are any).
In Excel VBA, you can use the Trim function for this.
For example,  " excel vba" will be converted to "excel vba".Add the following code lines in your If statement.
content = cell.Value

content = Trim(content)
Note: the trim function in Excel VBA does not remove extra spaces between words, but that's OK in this example.

6. At this point, a cell can still be empty.
If the cell is empty, we assign the value 0 to the variable cellWords.
If not, it contains at least one word and we assign the value  1 to the variable cellWords.
Add the following code lines in your If statement.
If content = "" Then

cellWords = 0
Else

cellWords = 1End If
A cell can contain more than one word of course.
That's exactly what we want to find out now.
As an example we take: "excel vba".
If a cell contains at least one space at this stage, it contains at least one more word.
You can use the Instr function in Excel VBA to look for a space.
Instr(content, " ") finds the position of the first space in content.

7. We will make use of the  <a href="../loop.html#do-while-loop">Do While Loop</a> structure.
Code placed between these words (at step 8, 9 and 10) will be repeated as long as the part after Do While is true.
We want to repeat these steps as long as Instr(content, " ") > 0 is true (as long as content contains a space and thus more words).
Add the Do While Loop in your If statement.
Do While InStr(content, " ") > 0
Loop

8. Next, we take the part of content starting at the position of the first space.
We use the <a href="../string-manipulation.html#mid">Mid function</a> for this.
content = Mid(content, InStr(content, " "))
For example: Mid("excel vba", InStr("excel vba", " ")) will give " vba".
9. We trim the string again.
content = Trim(content)
Result: "vba"

10. We increment cellWords by 1. 
cellWords = cellWords + 1
This Do While Loop will be repeated as long as content contains a space and thus more words.
In our example, we exit the Do While Loop since "vba" does not contain a space anymore! Result: this cell contains 2 words.

11. After having checked one cell, we add cellWords to the variable totalWords.
This code line should be placed outside the Do While Loop but in the If statement.
totalWords = totalWords + cellWords
The whole process starts again for the next cell until all cells have been checked.

12. Finally, we display the value of totalWords using a msgbox.
This code line should be placed outside the For Each Next loop.
MsgBox totalWords &amp; " words found in the selected range."

13. Test the program.

<h2>Compare Dates and Times</h2>
This example teaches you how to <k>compare dates and times</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
Dates and times are stored as numbers in Excel and count the number of days since January 0, 1900. What you see depends on the number format.

1. Enter some numbers in column A.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/numbers.png">

2. These numbers are dates.
This is a perfect way to enter some dates without worrying about the Date format.
Change the format to Date (Right click on the column A header, Format Cells and choose Date).
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/dates.png">
Note: Dates are in US Format.
Months first, Days Second.
This type of format depends on your windows regional settings.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

3. Declare the variable i of type Integer.
Dim i As Integer

4. Add a For Next loop.
For i = 1 To 5Next i

5. The Date function returns the current date without the time.
Add the following code line to the loop, to highlight all the cells containing the current date (3/13/2020).
If Cells(i, 1).Value = Date Then Cells(i, 1).Font.Color = vbRed
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/dates-equal-to.png" loading="lazy">

6. Add the following code line to the loop, to highlight all the dates earlier than 04/19/2019. 
If Cells(i, 1).Value &lt; DateValue("April 19, 2019") Then Cells(i, 1).Font.Color = vbRed
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/dates-earlier-than.png" loading="lazy">

7. But what about times, we hear you say.
They are the decimals.
Switch back to General format and change the numbers to decimal numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/decimal-numbers.png" loading="lazy">

8. Now change the format to 'Date and Time' format.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/date-time-format.png" loading="lazy">
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/dates-times.png" loading="lazy">

9. If you want to highlight all cells containing the current date, we cannot use the code line  at 5 anymore.
Why not? Because the numbers in column A are decimal numbers now.
Comparing it with Date (a whole number) would not give any match.
(It would only give a match with 3/13/2020 at midnight exactly!) The following code line does work:
If Int(Cells(i, 1).Value) = Date Then Cells(i, 1).Font.Color = vbRed
Explanation: we simply use the Int function.
The Int function rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
This way we can get the dates without the times and compare these dates with Date.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/dates-without-times-equal-to.png" loading="lazy">

10. Add the following code line to highlight all the cells containing times in the morning.
If (Cells(i, 1).Value - Int(Cells(i, 1).Value)) &lt; 0.5 Then Cells(i, 1).Font.Color = vbRed
Explanation: we only need the decimals so therefore we subtract the integer part.
Noon (halfway through the day) is represented as 0.5. Decimals lower than 0.5 are the times in the morning.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/compare-dates-times/times-in-the-morning.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>DateDiff Function</h2>
<a href="#dates">Dates</a>  |  <a href="#times">Times</a>
The <k>DateDiff function</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> can be used to get the number of days, weeks, months or years between two dates.
You can also use the DateDiff function to calculate the time difference between two times.
<h3>Dates</h3>
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim firstDate As Date, secondDate As Date, n As Integer

firstDate = DateValue("Jan 19, 2020")

secondDate = DateValue("Feb 25, 2020")

n = DateDiff("d", firstDate, secondDate)

MsgBox n
Explanation: first, we declare two dates.
Next, we initialize the two dates using the DateValue function.
The DateDiff function has three arguments.
Fill in "d" for the first argument to get the number of days between two dates.
Finally, we use a MsgBox to display the number of days between the two dates.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/datediff-function/days-between-two-dates.png">
Note: use "ww" to get the number of weeks between two dates.
Use "m" to get the number of months between two dates.
Use "yyyy" to get the number of years between two dates.
<h3>Times</h3>
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim firstTime As Date, secondTime As Date, x As Integer

firstTime = TimeValue("2:15:00 pm")

secondTime = TimeValue("5:15:00 pm")

x = DateDiff("h", firstTime, secondTime)

MsgBox x
Explanation: first, we declare two times (times are declared as dates).
Next, we initialize the two times using the TimeValue function.
The DateDiff function has three arguments.
Fill in "h" for the first argument to calculate the number of hours between two times.
Finally, we use a MsgBox to display the number of hours between the two times.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/datediff-function/hours-between-two-times.png">
Note: use "n" to calculate the number of minutes between two times.
Use "s" to calculate the number of seconds between two times.
Place your cursor on <k>DateDiff</k> in the Visual Basic Editor and click F1 for help on the other interval specifiers.
<h2>Weekdays</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that calculates the number of <k>weekdays</k> between two dates.
Weekdays are: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/weekdays/weekdays-example.png">
Note: Dates are in US Format.
Months first, Days Second.
This type of format depends on your windows regional settings.

1. First, we declare five variables.
date1 of type Date, date2 of type Date, dateToCheck of type Date, daysBetween of type Integer, weekdays of type Integer and i of type Integer.
Dim date1 As Date, date2 As
Date, dateToCheck As Date
Dim daysBetween As Integer, weekdays As Integer, i As Integer

2. We initialize four variables.
We use the DateDiff function to initialize the variable daysBetween.
This function has three arguments.
We fill in "d" for the first argument since we want the number of days between date1 and date2. 
weekdays = 0

date1 = Range("B2")

date2 = Range("B3")

daysBetween = DateDiff("d", date1, date2)

3. We need to check for each date between date1 and date2 (including date1 and date2) whether the date is a weekday or not.
If yes, we increment weekdays by 1. We will use a For Next loop.
For i = 0 To daysBetween
4. We use the DateAdd function to get each date we need to check.
This function has three arguments.
We fill in "d" for the first argument since we want to add days, i for the second argument, and date1 for the third argument since we want to add i days to date1. This way Excel VBA can check each date between date1 and date2 starting with date1. Add the following code line:
dateToCheck = DateAdd("d", i, date1)
Example: for i = 3, Excel VBA checks date1 + 3 days.

5. Next, we use the Weekday function (build in function) to check whether dateToCheck is a weekday or not.
The Weekday function returns 1 for a Sunday and 7 for a Saturday.
Therefore, we only increment the variable weekdays if Weekday(dateToCheck) is not equal to 1 and not equal to 7 (&lt;> means not equal to).
The following code lines get the job done.
If (Weekday(dateToCheck) &lt;> 1 And Weekday(dateToCheck) &lt;> 7) Then

weekdays = weekdays + 1End If

6. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i

7. Finally, we display the number of weekdays using a MsgBox.
We use the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) two strings.
Although weekdays is not a string it works here.
MsgBox weekdays &amp; " weekdays between these two dates"

8. Place your macro in a command button and test it.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/weekdays/weekdays-result.png">
<h2>Delay a Macro</h2>
To execute a sub in <k>Excel VBA</k> <k>after a specific time</k>, use onTime, Now and the TimeValue function.
First, place a sub into a module.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and click Insert, Module.

2. Add the following sub with name reminder:
Sub reminder()
MsgBox "Don't forget your meeting at 14.30"
End Sub
We want Excel VBA to execute this sub  5 seconds after a command button is clicked.

2.  Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Application.OnTime Now() + TimeValue("00:00:05"), "reminder"

3. Click the command button on the worksheet.
Result 5 seconds later:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/delay-a-macro/macro-executed-5-seconds-later.png">

4. If you want to execute this sub at a specific time, simply use the following code line:
Application.OnTime TimeValue("14:00:00 am"), "reminder"

5. Click the command button on the worksheet and wait until 14:00 AM to see your sub being executed.
Note: you will probably not use Excel VBA to remind yourself of an important meeting, but if you do want, it's best to put a macro like this in a <a href="../events.html#workbook-open-event">Workbook Open Event</a>.
By doing this, you will automatically receive a reminder at 14:00 AM (you don't have to click a command button to activate the macro).
Of course, you will only receive the reminder when  you leave your workbook open.
<h2>Year Occurrences</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that counts the number of <k>year occurrences</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/year-occurrences/year-occurrences-example.png">
Note: Dates are in US Format.
Months first, Days second.
This type of format depends on your windows regional settings.

1. First, we declare three variables of type Integer.
One variable we call yearCount, one variable we call yearAsk, and one variable we call i.
Dim yearCount As Integer, yearAsk As Integer, i As Integer

2. We initialize yearCount with the value 0 and yearAsk with the value of cell C4. 
yearCount = 0

yearAsk = Range("C4").Value

3. We start a For Next loop.
For i = 1 To 16
4. We now check each date and only if the year of the date equals the entered year in cell C4,  we increment yearCount by 1. We use the Year function to get the year of a date.
If Year(Cells(i, 1).Value) = yearAsk Then

yearCount = yearCount + 1End If

5. Don't forget to close the loop.Next i

6. Finally, we display the total year occurrences.
We use the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) two strings.
MsgBox yearCount &amp; " occurrences in year " &amp; yearAsk

7. Place your macro in a command button and test it.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/year-occurrences/year-occurrences-result.png">
Note: because we made yearAsk variable, you can simply count the number of year occurrences of another year by entering another year in cell C4, and clicking on the command button again.
<h2>Tasks on Schedule</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA </k>that sets the background color of <k>tasks that are on schedule</k> to green, and sets the background color of tasks that are behind schedule to red.
Situation:
On Sheet1 we have three tasks (X, Y, Z).
A "1" indicates that a task has been completed.
A task is on schedule if a "1" exist in every column up to and including today's date.
Today it's 6-Jun.
Tasks X and Y are on schedule.
Task Z is behind schedule (no "1" in cell E8).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/tasks-on-schedule/tasks-on-schedule-example.png">
Create a Worksheet Change Event.
Code added to the Worksheet Change Event will be executed by Excel VBA when you change a cell on a worksheet.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

2. Double click on Sheet1 (Sheet1) in the Project Explorer.

3. Choose Worksheet from the left drop-down list.
Choose Change from the right drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/events/worksheet-change-event.png">
Add the following code lines to the Worksheet Change Event:

4. Declare two variables of type Integer.
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer

5. Add a <a href="../loop.html#do-while-loop">Do While Loop</a>.
Do While Cells(6 + i, 1).Value &lt;> ""

i = i + 1Loop
Explanation: For i = 0, Excel VBA checks task X, for i = 1, task Y, etc.
Excel VBA leaves the Do While loop when Cells(6 + i, 1).Value <u>is</u> empty (no more tasks to check).
Add the following code lines (at 6, 7 and 8) to the Do While Loop.

6. Initialize the variable j with value 0. 
j = 0

7. Set the background color of a task to green assuming that a task is on schedule (this is not necessarily true of course).
Cells(6 + i, 1).Interior.ColorIndex = 4

8. Add another Do While Loop.
Do While Cells(4, 2 + j).Value &lt;= Date

If Cells(6 + i, 2 + j).Value = 0 Then Cells(6 + i, 1).Interior.ColorIndex = 3

j = j + 1Loop
Note: the Date function returns today's date.
Explanation: For i = 0, j = 0, Excel VBA checks cell B6. For i = 0, j = 1, Excel VBA checks cell C6, etc.
A task is on schedule if a "1" exists in every column up to and including today's date.
If Excel VBA finds a "0", it sets the background color of the task to red.

9. Test the program.
For example, indicate that task Z on 6-Jun has been completed.As a result, task Z will automatically turn green.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/tasks-on-schedule/tasks-on-schedule-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Sort Birthdays</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>sorts birthdays</k> by months first and days second (so we ignore years).
We want the birthday with the lowest month number at the first position.
If there are birthdays with equal month numbers, we want the birthday with the lowest day number first.
Are you ready?
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/sort-birthdays/sort-birthdays-example.png">
Note: Dates are in US Format.
Months first, Days second.
This type of format depends on your windows regional settings.

1. First, we declare eight variables.
One Date variable we call tempDate, one String variable we call tempName.
The other six variables are Integer variables with names monthToCheck, dayToCheck, monthNext, dayNext, i and j.
Dim tempDate As Date, tempName As String
Dim monthToCheck As Integer, dayToCheck As Integer, monthNext As Integer, dayNext As Integer, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. We start two For Next loops.
For i = 2 To 13
For j = i + 1 To 13Example: for i = 2, j = 3, 4, ...
, 12 and 13 are checked.

3. We initialize four Integer variables.
We use the Month function to get the month of a date and the Day function to get the day of a date.
monthToCheck = month(Cells(i, 2).Value)

dayToCheck = day(Cells(i, 2).Value)

monthNext = month(Cells(j, 2).Value)

dayNext = day(Cells(j, 2).Value)
For example: at the start, for i = 2; the date of Bregje, and j = i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3; the date of Niels will be chosen.
4. To sort the dates properly, we compare the first date  (monthToCheck and dayToCheck) with the next date (monthNext and dayNext).
If the next date is 'lower',  we swap the dates and names.
Add the following If Then statement.
If (monthNext &lt; monthToCheck) Or (monthNext = monthToCheck And dayNext &lt; dayToCheck) Then
End If
If the above statement is true, we swap the dates and names.
For example: for i = 2 and j = 3, the date of Bregje and Niels are checked.MonthNext = 6, monthToCheck = 2. The above statement is not true since monthNext is higher than monthToCheck.
Excel VBA increments j by 1 and repeats the code lines for i = 2 and j = 4. You can easily see that Joost (j = 4) has a higher month number than Bregje, so we go to the next one.
We get the same result for j = 5 and j = 6. When we arrive at j = 7, we have the following variables: monthNext = 2 and dayNext = 9. MonthToCheck = 2 and dayToCheck = 12. Now the above statement is true since monthNext = monthToCheck and dayNext (9) is lower than dayToCheck (12).

5. We <a href="swap-values.html">swap</a> the dates.
We temporarily store one date to tempDate, so that Excel VBA can swap the dates properly.
Add the following code lines in the If statement.
'swap dates

tempDate = Cells(i, 2).Value

Cells(i, 2).Value = Cells(j, 2).Value

Cells(j, 2).Value = tempDate

6. We do the same with the names.
Add the following code lines in the If statement.
'swap names

tempName = Cells(i, 1).Value

Cells(i, 1).Value = Cells(j, 1).Value

Cells(j, 1).Value = tempName

7. We close the second For Next loop (Outside the If statement).Next j
For i = 2 and j = 7, Excel VBA swapped the dates and names.That means  we get Richard at the first position and Bregje at position 7. That also means we get a new monthToCheck and dayToCheck at the start of our next iteration (for i = 2 and j = 8).
We will now compare Richard with Dineke (j = 8).
You can easily see that there is no need to replace those dates and names because Richard has a 'lower' date.
As a matter of fact, there is no need to replace Richard (i = 2) with Jan (j = 9), Wendy (j = 10), Jeroen (j = 11), John ( j= 12) and Debby (j = 13).
That is because Richard has the 'lowest' date.
This way Excel VBA will get (for i = 2) the 'lowest' date at the first position.
To get the second 'lowest' date at the second position, Excel VBA repeats the exact same steps for i = 3. To get the third 'lowest' date at the third position, Excel VBA repeats the exact same steps for i = 4, etc.

8. Close the first For Next loop (Outside the If statement).Next i

9. Test your program.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/highlight-active-cell/worksheet-selectionchange-event.png">
Add the following code lines to the Worksheet SelectionChange Event:

4. We declare four variables of type Integer.
One named rowNumberValue, one named columnNumberValue, one named i and one named j.
Dim rowNumberValue As Integer, columnNumberValue As Integer, i As Integer, j As Integer

5. First, we add the line which changes the background color of all cells to 'No Fill'.
Cells.Interior.ColorIndex = 0

6. We initialize the variable rowNumberValue with the row number of the Active Cell and the variable columnNumberValue with the column number of the Active Cell.
rowNumberValue = ActiveCell.row

columnNumberValue = ActiveCell.column

7. We highlight the column blue.
That is: all the cells with row number smaller or equal to rowNumberValue <u>and</u> column number equal to columnNumberValue
For i = 1 To rowNumberValue
Cells(i, columnNumberValue).Interior.ColorIndex = 37Next i
Explanation: for this example (see picture above), rowNumberValue equals 12 and columnNumberValue equals 8. The code lines between For and Next will be executed twelve times.
For i = 1, Excel VBA colors the cell at the intersection of row 1 and column 8. For i = 2, Excel VBA colors the cell at the intersection of row 2 and column 8, etc.Note: instead of ColorIndex number 37 (blue), you can use any ColorIndex number.

8. In a similar way, we highlight the row blue.
That is: all the cells with row number equal to rowNumberValue <u>and</u> column number smaller or equal to columnNumberValue.
For j = 1 To columnNumberValue
Cells(rowNumberValue, j).Interior.ColorIndex = 37Next j

9. Now it's time to test the program.
Download the Excel file and see how the row and column of the Active Cell are highlighted each time you change the Active Cell.
<h2>Create a Footer Before Printing</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>creates a footer before printing</k> a workbook.
Create a Workbook BeforePrint Event.
Code added to the Workbook BeforePrint Event will be executed by Excel VBA before you print a workbook.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

2. Double click on This Workbook in the Project Explorer.

3. Choose Workbook from the left drop-down list.
Choose BeforePrint from the right drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/create-a-footer-before-printing/workbook-beforeprint-event.png">

4. To create a footer, add the following code line to the Workbook BeforePrint Event:
ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftFooter = ActiveWorkbook.FullName
Note: The PageSetup object contains all page setup attributes (left footer, bottom margin, paper size, left margin, and so on) as properties.

5. Test the program by printing your workbook.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/create-a-footer-before-printing/footer.png">
<h2>Bills and Coins</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that splits an amount of money into <k>bills and coins</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/bills-coins/bills-coins-example.png">
Create a Worksheet Change Event.
Code added to the Worksheet Change Event will be executed by Excel VBA when you change a cell on a worksheet.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

2. Double click on Sheet1 (Sheet1) in the Project Explorer.

3. Choose Worksheet from the left drop-down list.
Choose Change from the right drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/events/worksheet-change-event.png">
Add the following code lines to the Worksheet Change Event:

4. Declare a variable called amount of type Double and a variable i of type Integer.
Dim amount As Double, i As Integer

5. The Worksheet Change Event listens to all changes on Sheet1. We only want Excel VBA to do something if something changes in cell B2. To achieve this, add the following code line:
If Target.Address = "$B$2" Then

6. We initialize the variable amount with the value of cell B2. 
amount = Range("B2").Value

7. We empty the range with the frequencies.
Range("B5:B16").Value = ""

8. Now it's time to split the entered amount of money.
We start a For Next loop.
For i = 5 To 16
9. We will make use of the <a href="../loop.html#do-while-loop">Do While Loop</a> structure.
Code placed between these words will be repeated as long as the part after Do While is true.
We want Excel VBA to repeat the code lines at step 10 as long as amount is larger or equal to Cells(i,1).value.
Do While amount >= Cells(i, 1).Value
Loop


10. Add the following code lines to the Do While Loop.
Cells(i, 2).Value = Cells(i, 2).Value + 1

amount = amount - Cells(i, 1).Value
Explanation: as long as amount is larger or equal to Cells(i,1).value, the amount contains bills/coins of this value.
As a result, Excel VBA increments the frequency of this bill/coin (first line) and subtracts the value of the bill/coin from  amount (second line).
This process will be repeated until amount becomes smaller than Cells(i,1).value.
Next, Excel VBA increments i and goes to the next bill/coin to see how many times this bill/coin fits in the amount left.
This way the amount of money will be split into bills and coins until there is no money left to split anymore.

11. Close the For Next loop and don't forget to close the if statement (both outside the Do While Loop).
 Next iEnd if

12. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/bills-coins/bills-coins-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: of course the entered amount does not necessarily contains every bill/coin.
If amount does not contain a certain bill/coin, the part after Do While never becomes true for this bill/coin and Excel VBA goes directly to the next bill/coin.
<h2>Rolling Average Table</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that creates a <k>rolling average table</k>.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the the following code line:
Range("B3").Value = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(0, 100)
This code line enters a random number between 0 and 100 into cell B3. We want Excel VBA to take the new stock value and place it at the first position of the rolling average table.
All other values should move down one place and the last value should be deleted.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/rolling-average-table/rolling-average-table-1.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/rolling-average-table/rolling-average-table-2.png">
Create a Worksheet Change Event.
Code added to the Worksheet Change Event will be executed by Excel VBA when you change a cell on a worksheet.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

2. Double click on Sheet1 (Sheet1) in the Project Explorer.

3. Choose Worksheet from the left drop-down list.
Choose Change from the right drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/events/worksheet-change-event.png" loading="lazy">
Add the following code lines to the Worksheet Change Event:

4. Declare a variable called newvalue of type Integer and two ranges (firstfourvalues and lastfourvalues).
Dim newvalue As Integer, firstfourvalues As Range, lastfourvalues As Range

5. The Worksheet Change Event listens to all changes on Sheet1. We only want Excel VBA to do something if something changes in cell B3. To achieve this, add the following code line:
If Target.Address = "$B$3" Then


6. We initialize newvalue with the value of cell B3, firstfourvalues with Range("D3:D6") and lastfourvalues with Range("D4:D7").
newvalue = Range("B3").Value
Set firstfourvalues = Range("D3:D6")
Set lastfourvalues = Range("D4:D7")

7. Now comes the simple trick.
We want to update the rolling average table.
You can achieve this by replacing the last four values with the first four values of the table and placing the new stock value at the first position.
lastfourvalues.Value = firstfourvalues.Value

Range("D3").Value = newvalue

8. Don't forget to close the if statement.End if

9. Finally, enter the formula =AVERAGE(D3:D7) into cell D8. 

10. Test the program by clicking on the command button.
<h2>Dynamic Array</h2>
If the size of your array increases and you don't want to fix the size of the array, you can use the <k>ReDim keyword</k>.
<k>Excel VBA</k> then changes the size of the array automatically.
Add some numbers to column A.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-array/dynamic-array-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare the array named numbers.
Also declare two variables of type Integer.
One named size and one named i.
Dim numbers() As Integer, size As Integer, i As Integer
Note: the array has no size yet.
numbers, size and i are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.

2. Next, we determine the size of the array and store it into the variable size.
You can use the worksheet function CountA for this.
Add the following code line:
size = WorksheetFunction.CountA(Worksheets(1).Columns(1))

3. We now know the size of the array and we can redimension it.
Add the following code line:
ReDim numbers(size)

4. Next, we initialize each element of the array.
We use a loop.
For i = 1 To size
numbers(i) = Cells(i, 1).ValueNext i

5. We display the last element of the array using a MsgBox.
MsgBox numbers(size)

6. Exit the Visual Basic Editor and click the command button on the sheet.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-array/last-element-array.png">

7. Now to clearly see why this is called a dynamic array, add a number to column A.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-array/add-number.png" loading="lazy">

8. Click the command button again.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-array/dynamic-array-result.png" loading="lazy">
Conclusion: Excel VBA has automatically changed the size of this dynamic array.

9. When you use the ReDim keyword, you erase any existing data currently stored in the array.
For example, add the following code lines to the previously created code:ReDim numbers(3)

MsgBox numbers(1)
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-array/without-preserve.png" loading="lazy">
The array is empty.

10. When you want to preserve the data in the existing array when you redimension it, use the Preserve keyword.
ReDim Preserve numbers(3)

MsgBox numbers(1)
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/dynamic-array/with-preserve.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Array Function</h2>
The <k>Array function</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> can be used to quickly and easily initialize an array.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, create a variable named departments of type Variant.
Dim departments As Variant

2. Use the Array Function to assign an array to the variable departments.
Add the following code line:
departments = Array("Sales", "Production", "Logistics")

3. To show the element with index 1, add the following code line:
MsgBox departments(1)
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/array-function/array-function-result-with-option-base-0.png">
By default, the element's index of the array starts from 0. 

4. Add Option Base 1 to the General Declarations section if you want the index to start from 1. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/array-function/add-option-base-1.png">
Result when you click the command button again.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/array-function/array-function-result-with-option-base-1.png" loading="lazy">
For a practical example of the Array function, see our example program <a href="month-names.html">Month Names</a>.<h2>Month Names</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> which creates a <a href="user-defined-function.html"><k>User Defined Function</k></a> that uses the Array function to return the <k>names of the months</k>.
User defined functions need to be placed into a module.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and click Insert, Module.

2. Add the following code line:
Function MONTHNAMES()
The name of our Function is MONTHNAMES.
The empty part between the brackets means we give Excel VBA nothing as input.

3. The Array function allows us to assign values to a Variant array in one line of code.
MONTHNAMES = Array("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

4. Don't forget to end the function.
End Function

5. Now you can use this function, just like any other Excel function, to return the names of the months.
Select twelve horizontal cells, enter the function =MONTHNAMES() and press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/month-names/month-names.png">
Note: you cannot delete a single month.
To delete the months, select the range A1:L1 and press Delete.
This function is only available in this workbook.

6. If you have Excel 365 or Excel 2021, simply select cell A1, enter the function =MONTHNAMES() and press Enter.
Bye bye curly braces.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/month-names/dynamic-array-formula.png" loading="lazy">
Note: the MONTHNAMES function, entered into cell A1, fills multiple cells.
Wow! This behavior in Excel 365/2021 is called <a href="../../examples/dynamic-arrays.html">spilling</a>.
<h2>Size of an Array</h2>
To get the <k>size of an array</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>, you can use the UBound and LBound functions.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we need to declare the array.
Our array has two dimensions.
It consists of 5 rows and 2 columns.
Also declare two variables of type Integer.
Dim Films(1 To 5, 1 To 2) As String, x As Integer, y As Integer
The array may look like this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/size-of-an-array/size-of-an-array-example.png">

2. Next, we get the size of the array.
Add the following code lines:
x = UBound(Films, 1) - LBound(Films, 1) + 1

y = UBound(Films, 2) - LBound(Films, 2) + 1
UBound(Films, 1) gives the upper limit of the first dimension, which is 5.

LBound(Films, 1) gives the lower limit of the first dimension, which is 1.

UBound(Films, 2) gives the upper limit of the second dimension, which is 2.

LBound(Films, 2) gives the lower limit of the second dimension, which is 1. 
As a result, x equals 5 and y equals 2. 

3. We use a MsgBox to display the number of elements of the array.
MsgBox "This array consists of " &amp; x * y &amp; " elements"
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/size-of-an-array/size-of-an-array-result.png">
<h2>User Defined Function</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that creates a <k>User Defined Function</k>.
Excel has a large collection of functions.
In most situations those functions are sufficient to get the job done.
If not, you can create your own function called User Defined Function or <k>custom Excel function</k>.
You can access a User Defined Function just like any other Excel function.
We want to create a function called SUMEVENNUMBERS that finds the sum of the even numbers of a randomly selected range.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/user-defined-function/user-defined-function-example.png">
User defined functions need to be placed into a module.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and click Insert, Module.

2. Add the following code line:
Function SUMEVENNUMBERS(rng As Range)
The name of our Function is SUMEVENNUMBERS.
The part between the brackets means we give Excel VBA a range as input.
We name our range rng, but you can use any name.

3. Next, we declare a Range object and call it cell.
Dim cell As Range

4. We want to check each cell in a randomly selected range (this range can be of any size).
In Excel VBA, you can use the For Each Next loop for this.
Add the following code lines:
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: cell is randomly chosen here, you can use any name.

5. Next, we check for each value in this range whether it is even or not.
We use the Mod operator for this.
The Mod operator gives the remainder of a division.
For example, 7 mod 2 = 1 because 7 divided by 2 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. Having said this, it is easy to check whether a number is even or not.Only if the remainder of a number divided by 2 is 0, the number is even.
For example, 8 mod 2 = 0 because 8 divided by 2 equals 4 with a remainder of 0. Add the following If statement to the For Each Next loop.If cell.Value Mod 2 = 0 Then
End If

6. Only if this statement is true, we add the value  to SUMEVENNUMBERS.
Add the following code line in the If statement.
SUMEVENNUMBERS = SUMEVENNUMBERS + cell.Value

7. Don't forget to end the function (outside the loop).
End Function

8. Now you can use this function, just like any other Excel function, to find the sum of the even numbers of a randomly selected range.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/user-defined-function/user-defined-function-result.png">
Well done! That's how easy User Defined Functions in Excel VBA are.
Note: this function is only available in this workbook.
<h2>Custom Average Function</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> which creates a <a href="user-defined-function.html"><k>User Defined Function</k></a> that calculates the <k>average</k> of a randomly selected range excluding one or more values that are outliers and shouldn't be averaged.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/custom-average-function/custom-average-function-example.png">
User defined functions need to be placed into a module.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and click Insert, Module.

2. Add the following code line:
Function CUSTOMAVERAGE(rng As Range, lower As Integer, upper As Integer)
The name of our Function is CUSTOMAVERAGE.
The part between the brackets means we give Excel VBA a range and two Integer variables as input.
We name our range rng, one Integer variable we call lower, and one Integer variable we call upper, but you can use any names.

3. Next, we declare a Range object and two variables of type Integer.
We call the Range object cell.
One Integer variable we call total and one Integer variable we call count.
Dim cell As Range, total As Integer, count As Integer

4. We want to check each cell in a randomly selected range (this range can be of any size).
In Excel VBA, you can use the For Each Next loop for this.
Add the following code lines:
For Each cell In rngNext cell
Note: rng and cell are randomly chosen here, you can use any names.
Remember to refer to these names in the rest of your code.

5. Next, we check for each value in this range if it falls between the two values (lower and upper).
If true, we increment total by the value of the cell and we increment count by 1. Add the following code lines to the loop.
If cell.Value >= lower And cell.Value &lt;= upper Then

total = total + cell.Value

count = count + 1End If

6. To return the result of this function (the desired average), add the following code line outside the loop.
CUSTOMAVERAGE = total / count

7. Don't forget to end the function.
Add the line:
End Function

8. Now you can use this function just like any other Excel function to calculate the average of numbers that fall between two values.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/custom-average-function/custom-average-function-result.png">
As a check, you can delete all values that are lower than 10 and higher than 30 and use the standard Average function in Excel to see if Excel calculates the same average as our custom average function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/custom-average-function/custom-average-function-check.png" loading="lazy">
Our custom average function works! Note: this function is only available in this workbook.
<h2>Volatile Functions</h2>
By default, UDF's (<a href="user-defined-function.html">User Defined Functions</a>) in <k>Excel VBA</k> are not volatile.
They are only recalculated when any of the function's arguments change.
A <k>volatile function</k> will be recalculated whenever calculation occurs in any cells on the worksheet.
Let's take a look at an easy example to explain this a bit more.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and click Insert, Module.
Create a function called MYFUNCTION which returns the sum of the selected cell and the cell below this cell.

2. Add the following code lines:
Function MYFUNCTION(cell As Range)

MYFUNCTION = cell.Value + cell.Offset(1, 0).Value

End Function

3. Now you can use this function, just like any other Excel function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/volatile-functions/non-volatile-function.png">

4. This is a non-volatile function.
Non-volatile functions are only recalculated when any of the function's arguments change.
Change the value of cell B2 to 8. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/volatile-functions/function-argument-changes.png">

5. Now change the value of cell B3 to 11. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/volatile-functions/any-other-cell-changes.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: the non-volatile function is not recalculated when any other cell on the sheet changes.

6. Update the function as follows to make the function volatile:
Function MYFUNCTION(cell As Range)

Application.Volatile

MYFUNCTION = cell.Value + cell.Offset(1, 0).Value

End Function

7. Change the value of cell B3 to 12. 
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/volatile-functions/volatile-function.png" loading="lazy">
Note: you need to enter the function again to make it volatile (or refresh it by placing your cursor in the formula bar and pressing enter).
<h2>ByRef and ByVal</h2>
You can pass arguments to a procedure (function or sub) <k>by reference</k> or <k>by value</k>.
By default, <k>Excel VBA</k> passes arguments by reference.
As always, we will use an easy example to make things more clear.
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
Dim x As Integer

x = 10

MsgBox Triple(x)

MsgBox x
The code calls the function  Triple.
It's the result of the second MsgBox we are interested in.
Functions need to be placed into a module.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a> and click Insert, Module.

2. Add the following code lines:
Function Triple(ByRef x As Integer) As Integer

x = x * 3

Triple = x

End Function
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/byref-byval/byref-result.png">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/byref-byval/byref-result.png">

3. Replace ByRef with ByVal.
Function Triple(ByVal x As Integer) As Integer

x = x * 3

Triple = x

End Function
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/byref-byval/byval-result-1.png" loading="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/byref-byval/byval-result-2.png" loading="lazy">
Explanation: When passing arguments by reference we are referencing the original value.
The value of x (the original value) is changed in the function.
As a result the second MsgBox displays a value of 30. When passing arguments by value we are passing a copy to the function.
The original value is not changed.
As a result the second MsgBox displays a value of 10 (the original value).
<h2>StatusBar</h2>
The <k>StatusBar property</k> of the Application object in <k>Excel VBA</k> can be used to indicate the progress of a lengthy macro.
This way, you can let the user know that a macro is still running.
Situation:
The macro we are going to create fills Range("A1:E20") with random numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/statusbar/statusbar-property-example.png">
Add the following code lines to the command button:

1. First, we declare three variables of type Integer, named i, j and pctCompl.
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, pctCompl As Integer

2. Add a <a href="../loop.html#double-loop">Double Loop</a>.
For i = 1 To 20
For j = 1 To 5Next jNext i
Add the following code lines (at 3, 4 and 5) to the loop.

3. Use the RandBetween function to import a random number between 20 and 100. 
Cells(i, j).Value = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(20, 100)

4. Initialize the variable pctCompl.
The second code line writes the value of the variable pctCompl and some descriptive text in the status bar.
pctCompl = (i - 1) * 5 + (j * 1)

Application.StatusBar = "Importing Data..
" &amp; pctCompl &amp; "% Completed"
Example: For i = 3, j = 1, (3 - 1) * 5 + (1 * 1) = 11% has been completed.

5. We use the Wait method of the Application object to simulate a lengthy macro.
Application.Wait Now + TimeValue("00:00:01")

6. To restore the default status bar text, set the StatusBar property to False (outside the loop).
Application.StatusBar = False

Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>reads data from a text file</k>.
This file contains some geographical coordinates we want to import into Excel.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/read-data-from-text-file/read-data-from-text-file-example.png">

1. First, download the text file and add it to "C:\test\"
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

2. We declare four variables.
myFile of type String, text of type String, textline of type String, posLat of type Integer, and posLong of type Integer.
Dim myFile As String, text As String, textline As String, posLat As Integer, posLong As Integer

3. We need to initialize the variable myFile with the full path and the filename.
myFile = "C:\test\geographical-coordinates.txt"
<u>or</u>
use the GetOpenFilename method of the Application object to display the standard Open dialog box and select the file (without actually opening the file).
myFile = Application.GetOpenFilename()
Note: the empty part between the brackets means we give Excel VBA nothing as input.
Place your cursor on GetOpenFilename in the Visual Basic Editor and click F1 for help on the arguments.

4. Add the following code line:
Open myFile For Input As #1
Note: this statement allows the file to be read.
We can refer to the file as #1 during the rest of our code.

5. Add the following code lines:

Do Until EOF(1)
Line Input #1, textline
text = text &amp; textlineLoop
Note: until the end of the file (EOF), Excel VBA reads a single line from the file and assigns it to textline.
We use the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) all the single lines and store it in the variable text.

6. Close the file.
Close #1

7. Next, we search for the position of the words latitude and longitude in the variable text.
We use the <a href="instr.html">Instr function</a>.
posLat = InStr(text, "latitude")

posLong = InStr(text, "longitude")

8. We use these positions and the <a href="../string-manipulation.html#mid">Mid function</a> to extract the coordinates from the variable text and write the coordinates to cell A1 and cell A2. 
Range("A1").Value = Mid(text, posLat + 10, 5)

Range("A2").Value = Mid(text, posLong + 11, 5)

9. Test the program.
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/read-data-from-text-file/read-data-from-text-file-result.png">
<h2>Write Data to Text File</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that <k>writes an Excel range to a CSV (comma-separated-value) text file</k>.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/write-data-to-text-file/write-data-to-text-file-example.png">
Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code lines:

1. First, we declare a variable called myFile of type String, an object called rng of type Range, a variable called cellValue of type Variant, a variable called i of type Integer, and a variable called j of type Integer.
We use a Variant variable here because a Variant variable can hold any type of value.
Dim myFile As String, rng As Range, cellValue As Variant, i As Integer, j As Integer

2. We need to specify the full path and the filename of the file.
myFile = Application.DefaultFilePath &amp; "\sales.csv"
Note: the DefaultFilePath property returns the default file path.
To change the default file location, on the File tab, click Options, Save.

3. We initialize the range object rng with the selected range.
Set rng = Selection

4. Add the following code line:
Open myFile For Output As #1
Note: this statement allows the file to be written to.
We can refer to the file as #1 during the rest of our code.
If the file already exists, it will be deleted and a new file with the same name will be created.

5. Start a <a href="../loop.html#double-loop">Double Loop</a>.
For i = 1 To rng.Rows.Count
For j = 1 To rng.Columns.CountNote: rng.Rows.Count returns the number of rows (17 in this example) and rng.Columns.Count returns the number of columns (4 in this example).

6. Excel VBA writes the value of a cell to the variable cellValue.
cellValue = rng.Cells(i, j).Value

7. Add the following code lines to write the value of cellValue to the text file.
If j = rng.Columns.Count Then

Write #1, cellValue
Else

Write #1, cellValue,End If
Explanation: due to the If Then Else statement, Excel VBA only starts a new line (Write #1, cellValue) when j equals the number of columns (last value in a row).
To separate the values with a comma, use Write #1, cellValue, (with a comma).

8. Don't forget to close both loops.
 Next jNext i

9. Close the file.
Close #1

10. Select the data and click the command button on the sheet.

<h2>Vlookup</h2>
Use the WorksheetFunction property in <k>Excel VBA</k> to access the <k>VLOOKUP</k> function.
All you need is a single code line.
Situation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/vlookup/vba-vlookup-example.png">

1. Place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Range("H3").Value = WorksheetFunction.VLookup(Range("H2"), Range("B3:E9"), 4, False)
When you click the command button on the worksheet, Excel VBA uses the VLOOKUP function to lookup the salary of ID 53 and places the result into cell H3. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/vlookup/vba-vlookup-result.png">
Note: visit our page about the <a href="../../examples/vlookup.html">VLOOKUP function</a> to learn more about this Excel function.
If the VLOOKUP function cannot find a match, Excel VBA returns the "Unable to get the <k>VLookup property</k> of the WorksheetFunction class" error.

2. For example, enter the value 28 into cell H2. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/vlookup/no-match.png" loading="lazy">

3. To replace this error with a friendly message, update the code as follows.
On Error GoTo InvalidValue:

Range("H3").Value = WorksheetFunction.VLookup(Range("H2"), Range("B3:E9"), 4, False)

Exit Sub

InvalidValue: Range("H3").Value = "Not Found"

<h2>Loan Calculator</h2>
This page teaches you how to create a simple <k>loan calculator</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k>.
The worksheet contains the following ActiveX controls: two scrollbars and two option buttons.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loan-calculator/loan-calculator-example.png">
Note: the instructions below do not teach you how to format the worksheet.
We assume that you know how to change font types, insert rows and columns, add borders, change background colors, etc.
Execute the following steps to create the loan calculator:

1. Add the two scrollbar controls.
Click on Insert from the Developer tab and then click on Scroll Bar in the ActiveX Controls section.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loan-calculator/create-scroll-bars.png">

2. Add the two option buttons.
Click on Insert from the Developer tab and then click on Option Button in the ActiveX Controls section.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loan-calculator/create-option-buttons.png" loading="lazy">
Change the following properties of the scrollbar controls (make sure Design Mode is selected).

3. Right mouse click on the first scrollbar control, and then click on Properties.
Set Min to 0, Max to 20, SmallChange to 0 and LargeChange to 2. 

4. Right mouse click on the second scrollbar control, and then click on Properties.
Set Min to 5, Max to 30, SmallChange to 1, LargeChange to 5, and LinkedCell to F8. 
Explanation: when you click on the arrow, the scrollbar value goes up or down by SmallChange.
When you click between the slider and the arrow, the scrollbar value goes up or down by LargeChange.
Create a Worksheet Change Event.
Code added to the Worksheet Change Event will be executed by Excel VBA when you change a cell on a worksheet.

5. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

6. Double click on Sheet1 (Sheet1) in the Project Explorer.

7. Choose Worksheet from the left drop-down list and choose Change from the right drop-down list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/events/worksheet-change-event.png" loading="lazy">

8. The Worksheet Change Event listens to all changes on Sheet1. We only want Excel VBA to run the Calculate sub if something changes in cell D4. To achieve this, add the following code line to the Worksheet Change Event (more about the Calculate sub later on).
If Target.Address = "$D$4" Then Application.Run "Calculate"


9. Get the right percentage in cell F6 (change the format of cell F6 to percentage).
Right mouse click on the first scrollbar control, and then click on View Code.
Add the following code lines:
Private Sub ScrollBar1_Change()

Range("F6").Value = ScrollBar1.Value / 100

Application.Run "Calculate"
End Sub

10. Right mouse click on the second scrollbar control, and then click on View Code.
Add the following code line:
Private Sub ScrollBar2_Change()

Application.Run "Calculate"
End Sub

11. Right mouse click on the first option button control, and then click on View Code.
Add the following code line:
Private Sub OptionButton1_Click()

If OptionButton1.Value = True Then Range("C12").Value = "Monthly Payment"

Application.Run "Calculate"
End Sub

12. Right mouse click on the second option button control, and then click on View Code.
Add the following code line:
Private Sub OptionButton2_Click()

If OptionButton2.Value = True Then Range("C12").Value = "Yearly Payment"

Application.Run "Calculate"
End Sub

13. Time to create the  sub.
You can go through our <a href="../function-sub.html">Function and Sub</a> chapter to learn more about subs.
If you are in a hurry, simply place the sub named Calculate into a module (In the Visual Basic Editor, click Insert, Module).
Sub Calculate()
Dim loan As Long, rate As Double, nper As Integer

loan = Range("D4").Value

rate = Range("F6").Value

nper = Range("F8").Value

If Sheet1.OptionButton1.Value = True Then

rate = rate / 12

nper = nper * 12End If

Range("D12").Value = -1 * WorksheetFunction.Pmt(rate, nper, loan)
End Sub
Explanation: the sub gets the right parameters for the worksheet function Pmt.
The <a href="../../examples/pmt.html">PMT function</a> in Excel calculates the payments for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.
If you make monthly payments (Sheet1.OptionButton1.Value = True), Excel VBA uses rate / 12 for rate and nper *12 for nper (total number of payments).
The result is a negative number, because payments are considered a debit.
Multiplying the result by -1 gives a positive result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/loan-calculator/loan-calculator-result.png" loading="lazy">
<h2>Userform and Ranges</h2>
You can use a <k>RefEdit control</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> to get a range from a user.
The <k>Userform</k> we are going to create colors the minimum value of the <k>range</k> stored in the RefEdit control.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/userform-ranges/userform-ranges-example.png">
To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">


3. Add the label, RefEdit control and command buttons.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a RefEdit control  by clicking on RefEdit  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a RefEdit control on the Userform.
Note: If your toolbox does not have a RefEdit control, set a reference to RefEdit control.
Click Tools, References, and check Ref Edit Control.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the Userform, label and command buttons, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We are now going to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
When you use the Show method for the Userform, this sub will automatically be executed.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

8. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.
Choose Initialize from the right drop-down list.

9. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

Sheet1.Cells.Font.Color = vbBlack

UserForm1.RefEdit1.Text = Selection.Address
End Sub
Explanation: the first code line  changes the font color of all the cells on sheet1 to black.
The second code line obtains the address of the current selection and displays it in the RefEdit control.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we click the command buttons on the Userform.

10. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

11. Double click on the Go button.

12. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Dim addr As String, rng, cell As Range, minimum
As Double

addr = RefEdit1.Value
Set rng = Range(addr)

minimum = WorksheetFunction.Min(rng)

For Each cell In rng
If cell.Value = minimum Then cell.Font.Color = vbRedNext cell
End Sub
Explanation: first, we get the address from the RefEdit control and store it into the String variable addr.
Next, we set rng to the range specified in the RefEdit control.
Next, we use the worksheet function Min to find the minimum value in the range.
Finally, we color the minimum value(s) using a loop.

13. Double click on the Cancel button.

14. Add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()

Unload Me
End Sub
Explanation: this code line closes the Userform when you click on the Cancel  button.

15. Test the Userform.

<h2>Currency Converter</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> which creates a Userform that <k>converts</k> any amount from one <k>currency</k> into another.
The Userform we are going to create looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/currency-converter/currency-converter-example.png">

To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">

3. Add the labels, list boxes (first at the left, the second at the right), text boxes (first at the left, the second at the right) and command button.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a list box control by clicking on ListBox  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a list box on the Userform.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the Userform, command button and labels, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We are now going to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
When you use the Show method for the Userform, this sub will automatically be executed.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

8. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.
Choose Initialize from the right drop-down list.

9. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

With ListBox1

.AddItem "Euro"

.AddItem "Us Dollar"

.AddItem "British Pound"
End With

With ListBox2

.AddItem "Euro"

.AddItem "Us Dollar"

.AddItem "British Pound"
End With

ListBox1.ListIndex = 1

ListBox2.ListIndex = 0

TextBox1.Value = 1

TextBox2.Value = 0.722152
End Sub
Explanation: first, the two list boxes are filled.
Next, The US Dollar currency is set as default in the first list box and the EURO currencyis set as default in the second list box.
Finally, the value 1 is entered in the first text box and the value 0.722152 is entered in the second text box.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we click on the Go button.

10. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

11. Double click on the Go button.

12. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Dim rates(0 To 2, 0 To 2) As Double, i As Integer, j As Integer

rates(0, 0) = 1

rates(0, 1) = 1.38475

rates(0, 2) = 0.87452

rates(1, 0) = 0.722152

rates(1, 1) = 1

rates(1, 2) = 0.63161

rates(2, 0) = 1.143484

rates(2, 1) = 1.583255

rates(2, 2) = 1

For i = 0 To 2
For j = 0 To 2
If ListBox1.ListIndex = i And ListBox2.ListIndex = j Then TextBox2.Value = TextBox1.Value * rates(i, j)
Next jNext i
End Sub
Explanation: first, we declare an array.
The array has two dimensions.
It consists of 3 rows and 3 columns.
Next, we initialize each element of the array.
For example, rates(1,0) is the currency rate from US Dollar to EURO.Next, we start a double loop.
Depending on the selected currencies in the list boxes, Excel VBA converts the amount entered in the first text box and displays the result in the second text box.
Example: if i = 2 and j = 1 and we enter the value 2 in the first text box, Excel VBA places the value 2 * rates(2,1) = 2 * 1.583255= 3.16651 in the second text box.

13. Test the Userform.

<h2>Progress Indicator</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that creates a <k>progress indicator</k>.
We've kept the progress indicator as simple as possible, yet it looks professional.
Are you ready?
The Userform we are going to create looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/progress-indicator/progress-indicator-example.png">
To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">
This Userform only consists of three controls.
A frame control and two label controls.

3. Add the frame control.
You can do this by clicking on Frame from the Toolbox.
Next, you can drag a frame control on the Userform.
You need to change some properties of this frame control.
Right mouse click on the frame control, and then click on Properties.
Empty the Caption field, set the Height to 24 and Width to 204. 

4. Add the first label control and place it in the Frame control.
Right mouse click on the label control, and then click on Properties.
Change the name to Bar, BackColor to Highlight, empty the Caption field, set the Height to 20 and Width to 10. 

5. Add the second label control and place it above the Frame control.
Right mouse click on the label control, and then click on Properties.
Change the name to Text and change the Caption to '0% Completed'.

6. Change the caption of the Userform to Progress Indicator.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.

7. Place a command button on your worksheet and add the following code line to show the Userform:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
If you have gone through the other Userform examples on this site, you know that this is the time to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
This Sub runs automatically whenever the Userform is loaded.
Thus, when you use the Show method for the Userform, the code will automatically be executed.
Instead of the Sub UserForm_Initialize, we create the Sub UserForm_Activate.
By using this sub, Excel VBA can update the Userform to show the progress of the macro.

8. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

9. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

10. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.
Choose Activate from the right drop-down list.

11. Add the following code line:
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()

code
End Sub
Explanation: this sub calls another sub named code we are going to create in a minute.
Confused? You can go through our <a href="../function-sub.html">Function and Sub</a> chapter to learn more about subs.
If you are in a hurry, just execute the following steps and you will be fine.

12. Place the sub named code into a module (In the Visual Basic Editor, click Insert, Module).
This is just an example.
This is THE place to add your own code when you want to use this progress indicator for your own macro.
The code looks as follows.
Sub code()
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, pctCompl As Single

Sheet1.Cells.Clear

For i = 1 To 100
For j = 1 To 1000
Cells(i, 1).Value = j
Next j

pctCompl = i

progress pctComplNext i
End Sub
Explanation: first, we initialize some variables.
Next, we clear sheet1. We use a double loop to show the values from 1 to 1000 in the first 100 rows of the worksheet.
This will keep Excel VBA busy for a while and gives us the opportunity to see the progress of the macro.
The variable pctCompl (abbreviation for percentageCompleted) measures the progress of the macro.
Finally, we call another sub named progress and pass the value of the variable pctCompl to update the Userform.
This way we can see the progress of the macro!

13. Add another sub named progress.
The code looks as follows:
Sub progress(pctCompl As Single)
UserForm1.Text.Caption = pctCompl &amp; "% Completed"

UserForm1.Bar.Width = pctCompl * 2

DoEvents
End Sub
Explanation: the first code line changes the caption of the first label control.
The second code line changes the width of the second label control.
Add DoEvents to update the Userform.

14. Exit the Visual Basic Editor and click the command button on the sheet:
Result:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/progress-indicator/progress-indicator-result.png" loading="lazy">
Note: for this macro, we used the variable i to measure the progress.
For example, at row 11, 10% is completed.This may be different for your macro.
The technique of passing the value of the variable pctCompl to the sub progress to update the Userform remains the same.
<h2>Multiple List Box Selections</h2>
The <k>MultiSelect property</k> in <k>Excel VBA</k> allows a user to select multiple items in a list box.
The Userform we are going to create looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/multiple-list-box-selections/multiple-list-box-selections-example.png">
To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">

3. Add the list boxes (first at the left, the second at the right), command buttons, check boxes (first at the left, the second at the right), frame and option buttons (first at the top, the second below the first, and so on).
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a list box control  by clicking on ListBox  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a list box on the Userform.
When you arrive at the 'Select Type' frame, remember to draw this frame first before you place the three option buttons in it.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the Userform, command buttons, check boxes, frame and option buttons, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We are now going to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
When you use the Show method for the Userform, this sub will automatically be executed.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

8. First, declare the variable i of type Integer.
Declare the variable in the General Declarations section (at the top of the code).
This way you only have to  declare the variable once and you can use them in multiple subs.
Dim i As Integer

9. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.
Choose Initialize from the right drop-down list.

10. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

With ListBox1

.AddItem "Sales"

.AddItem "Production"

.AddItem "Logistics"

.AddItem "Human Resources"
End With

OptionButton3.Value = True
End Sub
Explanation: the first list box will be filled and the third option button is set as default.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we click the command buttons or the other controls.

11. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

12. Double click on the Add button.

13. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

For i = 0 To ListBox1.ListCount - 1
If ListBox1.Selected(i) = True Then ListBox2.AddItem ListBox1.List(i)Next i
End Sub
Explanation: Excel VBA loops through the first list box (list index number of zero (0) for the first item in the list) and, if selected, adds the item to the second list box.

14. Double click on the Remove button.

15. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()

Dim counter As Integer

counter = 0

For i = 0 To ListBox2.ListCount - 1
If ListBox2.Selected(i - counter) Then

ListBox2.RemoveItem (i - counter)

counter = counter + 1
End IfNext i

CheckBox2.Value = False
End Sub
Explanation: Excel VBA loops through the second list box and, if selected, removes the item.
The counter variable holds track of the number of removed items.

16. Double click on the first option button.

17. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub OptionButton1_Click()

ListBox1.MultiSelect = 0

ListBox2.MultiSelect = 0
End Sub

18. Double click on the second option button.

19. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub OptionButton2_Click()

ListBox1.MultiSelect = 1

ListBox2.MultiSelect = 1
End Sub

20. Double click on the third option button.

21. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub OptionButton3_Click()

ListBox1.MultiSelect = 2

ListBox2.MultiSelect = 2
End Sub
Explanation: the 'Select Type' setting can be chosen by clicking on the option buttons.
The picture of the Userform shown earlier gives a description of each setting.
Instead of configuring this setting at runtime, you can also configure this setting at design time.
To achieve this, right mouse click on a list box control, and then click on Properties.
Set the MultiSelect property to 0 - fmMultiSelectSingle, 1 - fmMultiSelectMulti or 2 - fmMultiSelectExtented.

22. Double click on the first check box.

23. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()

If CheckBox1.Value = True Then

For i = 0 To ListBox1.ListCount - 1
ListBox1.Selected(i) = True
Next iEnd If

If CheckBox1.Value = False Then

For i = 0 To ListBox1.ListCount - 1
ListBox1.Selected(i) = False
Next iEnd If
End Sub
Explanation: by checking the first check box, all the items of the first list box can be selected / deselected.

24. Double click on the second check box to add the same code lines.
Only replace CheckBox1 with CheckBox2 and ListBox1 with ListBox2. 
<h2>Multicolumn Combo Box</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> which creates a Userform that contains a <k>multicolumn combo box</k>.
The Userform we are going to create looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/multicolumn-combo-box/multicolumn-combo-box-example.png">
To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">

3. Add the label, combo box and command buttons.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a combo box control by clicking on ComboBox  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a combo box on the Userform.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the Userform, label and command buttons, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We are now going to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
When you use the Show method for the Userform, this sub will automatically be executed.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

8. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.

Dim Films(1 To 5, 1 To 2) As String
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer

Films(1, 1) = "Lord of the Rings"

Films(2, 1) = "Speed"

Films(3, 1) = "Star Wars"

Films(4, 1) = "The Godfather"

Films(5, 1) = "Pulp Fiction"

Films(1, 2) = "Adventure"

Films(2, 2) = "Action"

Films(3, 2) = "Sci-Fi"

Films(4, 2) = "Crime"

Films(5, 2) = "Drama"

ComboBox1.List = Films
End Sub
Explanation: The first code line sets the number of columns of the combo box to 2. Instead of setting the number of columns at runtime, you can also configure this setting at design time.
To achieve this, right mouse click on the combo box control, click Properties and set the ColumnCount property to 2. Next, we declare and initialize a <a href="../array.html#two-dimensional-array">two-dimensional array</a>.
The last code line assigns the array to the combo box.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we click the command buttons on the Userform.

10. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

11. Double click on the OK button.

12. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Unload Me

MsgBox "You selected " &amp; ComboBox1.Value

On Error Resume Next

MsgBox "You like " &amp; ComboBox1.Column(1) &amp; " movies"
End Sub
Note: these code lines close the Excel VBA Userform and display the selected item and genre.
The 'On Error Resume Next' statement ignores the error when the user fills in his/her own movie (in this case there is no genre available).

13. Double click on the Cancel button.

14. Add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()

Unload Me
End Sub

Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a check box control by clicking on CheckBox  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a check box on the Userform.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the Userform, label, check boxes and command button, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we click on the Clear button.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

8. Double click on the Clear button.

9. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Dim contr As control

For Each contr In UserForm1.Controls
If TypeName(contr) = "CheckBox" Then

contr.Value = False
End If
Next
End Sub
Explanation: Excel VBA loops through all controls on the Userform.
The TypeName function is used to filter out the check box controls.
If a check box control, Excel VBA unchecks the check box.
contr is randomly chosen here, you can use any name.
Remember to refer to this name in the rest of your code.
Result when you click the Clear button:

<h2>Controls Collection</h2>
When creating Userforms in <k>Excel VBA</k>, you can use the <k>Controls collection</k> to easily loop through controls and set a property of each control to a specific value.
The Userform we are going to create looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/controls-collection/controls-collection-example.png">
To create this Userform, execute the following steps:

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">

3. Add the label, text boxes (first at the top, the second below the first, and so on) and command button.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a text box control by clicking on TextBox  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a text box on the Userform.

4. To change the caption of the Userform, label and command button, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show vbModeless
End Sub
Explanation: by adding vbModeless, you can use the Userform and work in your worksheet at the same time.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we click the command button on the Userform.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

8. Double click on the command button.

9. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Dim i As Integer

For i = 1 To 10
Controls("TextBox" &amp; i).Value = Cells(i + 1, 1).ValueNext i
End Sub

Explanation: With just a few lines of code, we can fill the text boxes with the phone numbers from the sheet.
We used the &amp; operator to concatenate (join) the elements.
These code lines work because we didn't change the names of the text box controls (TextBox1, TextBox2, TextBox3, etc).
To change the names of the controls, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.
Result when you click the command button on the sheet:

<h2>Userform with Multiple Pages</h2>
Below we will look at a program in Excel VBA which creates a Userform that contains multiple pages.
This userform also contains images.
The Multipage Control contains two pages.
At page 1, the user can fill in his/her personal information.
At page 2, the user can indicate which painting he/she likes the most.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/userform-with-multiple-pages/userform-page1.png"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/userform-with-multiple-pages/userform-page2.png">
To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png" loading="lazy">

3. Add the Multipage control, labels, text boxes (first at the top, the second below the first), frame, option buttons (first at the left, the second at the right), list box, Image control and command button.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the empty version of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a Multipage control  by clicking on Multipage  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a Multipage control  on the Userform.
When you arrive at the Gender frame, remember to draw this frame first before you place the two option buttons in it.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the Userform, Multipage tabs, labels, frame, option buttons and command button, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We are now going to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
When you use the Show method for the Userform, this sub will automatically be executed.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

8. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.
Choose Initialize from the right drop-down list.

9. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

With ListBox1

.AddItem "Mountains"

.AddItem "Sunset"

.AddItem "Beach"

.AddItem "Winter"
End With
End Sub
Explanation: the list box on page 2 will be filled.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we select an item from the list box or when we click on the OK button.

10. Download the images (right side of this page) and add them to "C:\test\"

11. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

12. Double click on the list box.

13. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub ListBox1_Click()

If ListBox1.ListIndex = 0 Then

Image1.Picture = LoadPicture("C:\test\Mountains.jpg")End If

If ListBox1.ListIndex = 1 Then

Image1.Picture = LoadPicture("C:\test\Sunset.jpg")End If

If ListBox1.ListIndex = 2 Then

Image1.Picture = LoadPicture("C:\test\Beach.jpg")End If

If ListBox1.ListIndex = 3 Then

Image1.Picture = LoadPicture("C:\test\Winter.jpg")End If
End Sub
Explanation: these code lines load a picture depending on the selected item in the list box.

14. Double click on the OK button.

15. Add the following code lines:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Dim emptyRow As Long

'Make Sheet1 active

Sheet1.Activate

'Determine emptyRow

emptyRow = WorksheetFunction.CountA(Range("A:A")) + 1

'Transfer information

Cells(emptyRow, 1).Value = TextBox1.Value

Cells(emptyRow, 2).Value = TextBox2.Value

If OptionButton1.Value = True Then

Cells(emptyRow, 3).Value = "Male"
Else

Cells(emptyRow, 3).Value = "Female"End If

Cells(emptyRow, 4).Value = ListBox1.Value

'Close Userform

Unload Me
End Sub
Explanation: first, we activate Sheet1. Next, we determine emptyRow.
The variable emptyRow is the first empty row and increases every time a record is added.
Next, we transfer the information from the Userform to the specific columns of emptyRow.
Finally, we close the Userform.

16. Exit the Visual Basic Editor, enter the labels shown below into row 1 and test the Userform.
Result:

<h2>Interactive Userform</h2>
Below we will look at a program in <k>Excel VBA</k> that creates an <k>interactive Userform</k>.
The Userform we are going to create looks as follows:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/images/interactive-userform/interactive-userform-1.png">
Explanation: whenever you enter a value in the ID text box, Excel VBA loads the corresponding record.
When you click the Edit / Add button, Excel VBA edits the record on the sheet or adds the record when the ID does not yet exist.
The Clear button clears all the text boxes.
The Close button closes the Userform.
To create this Userform, execute the following steps.

1. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.
If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View, Project Explorer.

2. Click Insert, Userform.
If the Toolbox does not appear automatically, click View, Toolbox.
Your screen should be set up as below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/userform/userform-screen-setup.png">

3. Add the labels, text boxes (first at the top, the second below the first, and so on) and command buttons.
Once this has been completed, the result should be consistent with the picture of the Userform shown earlier.
For example, create a text box control by clicking on TextBox  from the Toolbox.Next, you can drag a text box on the Userform.

4. You can change the names and the captions of the controls.
Names are used in the Excel VBA code.
Captions are those that appear on your screen.
It is good practice to change the names of the controls, but it is not necessary here because we only have a few controls in this example.
To change the caption of the labels, text boxes and command buttons, click View, Properties Window and click on each control.

5. To show the Userform, place a <a href="../create-a-macro.html#command-button">command button</a> on your worksheet and add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

UserForm1.Show
End Sub
We are now going to create the Sub UserForm_Initialize.
When you use the Show method for the Userform, this sub will automatically be executed.

6. Open the <a href="../create-a-macro.html#visual-basic-editor">Visual Basic Editor</a>.

7. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

8. Choose Userform from the left drop-down list.
Choose Initialize from the right drop-down list.

9. Add the following code line:
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

TextBox1.SetFocus
End Sub
Explanation: this code line sets the focus on the first text box as this is where we want to start when the Userform is loaded.
We have now created the first part of the Userform.
Although it looks neat already, nothing will happen yet when we enter a value in the ID text box or when we click one of the command buttons.

10. In the Project Explorer, right click on UserForm1 and then click View Code.

11. Choose TextBox1 from the left drop-down list.
Choose Change from the right drop-down list.

12. Add the following code line:
Private Sub TextBox1_Change()

GetData
End Sub

13. In the Project Explorer, double click on UserForm1. 

14. Double click on the Edit / Add command button.

15. Add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

EditAdd
End Sub

16. Double click on the Clear command button.

17. Add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()

ClearForm
End Sub
Explanation: these subs call other subs we are going to create in a second.

18. Double click on the Close command button.

19. Add the following code line:
Private Sub CommandButton3_Click()

Unload Me
End Sub
Explanation: this code line closes the Userform.
Time to create the  subs.
You can go through our <a href="../function-sub.html">Function and Sub</a> chapter to learn more about subs.
If you are in a hurry, simply place the following subs into a module (In the Visual Basic Editor, click Insert, Module).

20. First, declare three variables of type Integer and one variable of type Boolean.
Declare the variables in the General Declarations section (at the top of the module).
This way you only have to  declare the variables once and you can use them in multiple subs.
Dim id As Integer, i As Integer, j As Integer, flag As Boolean

21. Add the GetData sub.
Sub GetData()
If IsNumeric(UserForm1.TextBox1.Value) Then

flag = False

i = 0

id = UserForm1.TextBox1.Value

Do While Cells(i + 1, 1).Value &lt;> ""

If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value = id Then

flag = True

For j = 2 To 3
UserForm1.Controls("TextBox" &amp; j).Value = Cells(i + 1, j).Value
Next j
End If

i = i + 1
Loop

If flag = False Then

For j = 2 To 3
UserForm1.Controls("TextBox" &amp; j).Value = ""
Next j
End If

Else

ClearFormEnd If
End Sub
Explanation: If the ID text box contains a numeric value, Excel VBA searches for the ID and loads the corresponding record.
We use the <a href="controls-collection.html">Controls Collection</a> to easily loop through text boxes.
If Excel VBA cannot find the ID (flag is still False), it empties the second and third text box.
If the ID text box does not contain a numeric value, Excel VBA calls the ClearForm sub.

22. Add the ClearForm sub.
Sub ClearForm()
For j = 1 To 3
UserForm1.Controls("TextBox" &amp; j).Value = ""Next j
End Sub
Explanation: Excel VBA clears all the text boxes.

23. Add the EditAdd sub.
Sub EditAdd()
Dim emptyRow As Long

If UserForm1.TextBox1.Value &lt;> "" Then
flag = False
i = 0
id = UserForm1.TextBox1.Value
emptyRow = WorksheetFunction.CountA(Range("A:A")) + 1

Do While Cells(i + 1, 1).Value &lt;> ""

If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value = id Then
flag = True
For j = 2 To 3
Cells(i + 1, j).Value = UserForm1.Controls("TextBox" &amp; j).Value
Next j
End If

i = i + 1
Loop

If flag = False Then

For j = 1 To 3
Cells(emptyRow, j).Value = UserForm1.Controls("TextBox" &amp; j).Value
Next j
End If
End If
End Sub
Explanation: If the ID text box is not empty, Excel VBA edits the record on the sheet (the opposite of loading a record as we have seen earlier).
If Excel VBA cannot find the ID (flag is still False), it adds the record to the next empty row.
The variable emptyRow is the first empty row and increases every time a record is added.

24. Exit the Visual Basic Editor, enter the labels shown below into row 1 and test the Userform.
