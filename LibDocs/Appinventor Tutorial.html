<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/beginner-tutorials-short.html">Beginner Tutorials: Short Videos to get started</a>
With these <k>beginner-friendly</k> tutorials, you will learn the basics of programming apps for Android.
Follow these four short videos and you'll have <k>three working apps</k> to show for it! After building the starter apps, which will take around an hour, you can move on to extending them with more functionality, or you can start building apps of your own design.
<k>Get started now with Video 1 (5 minutes)</k>.

<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hellopurr.html">Hello Purr for App Inventor 2</a>
Hello Purr is the Hello World tutorial for App Inventor.
This simple exercise takes you through the very basics of App Inventor.

<em>This version of the tutorial is for use with App Inventor 2.</em>

Basic
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/magic-8-ball.html">Magic 8 Ball for App Inventor 2</a>
This introductory module will guide you through building a Magic 8 Ball app with App Inventor 2.
When activated, your 8 Ball will deliver one of its classic predictions, such as “It is decidedly so” or “Reply hazy, try again.” At first you activate the 8 Ball by clicking a button.
If you are using a device (rather than the emulator) you can add in an accelerometer component so that the 8 Ball makes a new prediction whenever the device is shaken.
Note: This tutorial can be used in place of Hello Purr since it initially has the same functionality, and then goes on to the extend that functionality.
<i>This version of the tutorial is for use with App Inventor 2.</i>

<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/android-wheres-my-car.html">Android, Where&#039;s My Car? for App Inventor 2</a>
You parked somewhere near the stadium, but when the concert ends you don't have a clue where the car is.
Fortunately you haven't lost your Android phone that never forgets anything, and you remember you have the hot new app, Android, Where's My Car?.
With this app, you click a button when you park your car, and the Android uses its location sensor to record the car's GPS coordinates and address.
Later, when you reopen the app, it shows you a map from where you are to the remembered location-- problem solved! With this tutorial you'll be able to download a created app and then study the annotated blocks below to better understand the app and App Inventor programming in general.
This app covers: <k>GPS, TinyDB, and using Activity Starter to open a map</k>.

The location sensor object is used to communicate with the global positioning satellite receiver (GPS) in your phone/tablet.
When the LocationSensor communicates with the built-in GPS receiver, the GPS can determine the location of your device.
 The sensor can also work with network/wifi location services.
 Finding a location using the network uses very different techniques to determine a location.
Location means, the device's present latitude and longitude or it can mean your street address.
