<h1>How to Flirt</h1>
Flirting, at its most basic, is playfully showing you are romantically attracted to someone. 
If you are ready to flirt with someone, you should already know you are sexually attracted to them, and like them! It might seem nerve-wracking to start flirting and put yourself out there, but fear not—it's normal to be nervous around someone you <i>really</i> like, and there are ways to seem confident and pull off a successful flirtation. 
Whether you're flirting online or in-person, it's important to keep a balance between revealing your feelings and keeping the person you like intrigued. 
If you want to know how to flirt and you'd like some help getting to know someone, this article gives some general advice.

<h2>Steps</h2>

<h3>Method 1 of 2: Flirting In-Person</h3>

<a href="/Make-Eye-Contact" title="Make Eye Contact"><b>Make eye contact</b></a><b>.</b> Eye contact is the best and easiest thing you can do to start flirting. 
You can look deeply into the person's eyes while also taking the time to break eye contact to keep things from getting too intense.
Consider using it in these ways:

Get caught looking. 
Don't stare, but do throw small glances at someone. 
Keep doing it until he or she catches you. 
Hold the gaze for a second, <a href="/Smile" title="Smile">smile</a>, and look away.
Look into his or her eyes when you talk, particularly at meaningful points in the conversation (for example, while you're paying a compliment).

<a href="/Wink" title="Wink">Wink</a> or <a href="/Arch-Eyebrows" title="Arch Eyebrows">raise your eyebrows</a> at your crush. 
It's cheesy, but it works if used sparingly. 
Do it when you're looking at someone from across a room, or if you're talking in a group and say something really meant for him or her.
Girls can try looking at a guy, lowering your gaze, and looking up at the guy again through lowered lashes.

2
<a href="/Smile" title="Smile"><b>Smile</b></a><b>.</b> You'll probably smile automatically if you're talking to someone you like, but you can use your pearly whites to your advantage before the conversation even starts. 
You can even smile at the person when you pass him or her by in the halls, or just from across the room. 
You don't have to grin from ear to ear, either; just a simple, subtle smile will do the trick. 
Try these variations:

Smile slowly. 
If you're looking at someone but not talking to them, try letting a slow smile spread over your face instead of breaking into an insta-grin. 
Slow, languid smiles are generally considered sexy.
Smile when you make eye contact. 
If you're suddenly looking into someone's eyes, toss in a smile for extra appeal. 
(If it's a genuine smile, the other person will see it without even looking at your mouth — it will crinkle your eyes, and is known as a Duchenne smile.)
Try smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. 
Make your whole face light up when you smile.

3
<b>Start talking.</b> <a href="/Introduce-Yourself" title="Introduce Yourself">Introduce yourself</a> — or maintain the <a href="/Be-Mysterious" title="Be Mysterious">mystery</a> (optional). 
If you don't already know the person you're flirting with, an introduction (or lack of one) can be a great thing to build flirting around. 
Avoid the urge to have a cheesy pick-up line. 
Saying "Hi" followed by an introduction or a simple question is much more effective and less forced.

If your crush doesn't know your name and you're a naturally gregarious person, try introducing yourself at some point. 
It can be as simple as, "Hi, I'm [name]. 
And you are...?"  Make <i>sure</i> you get the other person's name. 
To help yourself remember it, try repeating it after he or she says it to you. 
(Such as "Lily. 
I love that name.")
Or, if you want to make yourself seem like a bit of a challenge, work to keep your identity a mystery for a little while. 
If the other person really wants to know, he or she will ask around or keep pursuing you.
If the person you are interested speaks in another language like <a href="/Flirt-in-Spanish" title="Flirt in Spanish">Spanish</a>, pick up a few words of the language before you strike a conversation.

4
<a href="/Start-a-Good-Conversation" title="Start a Good Conversation"><b>Initiate a conversation</b></a><b>.</b> Whether you already know the other person or not, a conversation is the best way to move the flirtation forward. 
The person you're flirting with will be impressed by your boldness and confidence. 
Here are a few guidelines:

Talk to someone you don't already know. 
Perhaps the best way to strike up a conversation is to start with an observation which ends with a question: "I can't believe how much it's rained this week" or "This place sure is packed, eh?"  What you say isn't important — you are simply inviting the person to talk with you.
Find common ground with someone you do know. 
If you've already met the other person, strike up a conversation based on a shared experience or interest. 
For instance, you might talk about a class you're taking together, or the train you both take to work. 
Again, the topic itself doesn't matter — what matters is that you're inviting him or her to interact with you.
Gauge the response. 
If the person responds pleasantly, continue the conversation. 
If the person doesn't respond or seems preoccupied or disinterested, he or she probably isn't interested in flirting with you.

5
<b>Keep it light.</b> Don't bring up anything too personal when you're talking. 
Talk about the environment around you, the show you just saw, etc. 
Keep personal information (such as religion, money, relationships, education, and so on) out of it, unless the person enjoys intellectual debates without becoming over-emotional. 
Generally, it's best to avoid debating topics personally relevant to either of you (such as either yours or their religion) and to rather discuss topics you both don't have a personal stake in.

It's easier to flirt when you're talking about more fun and lighthearted topics, such as your pets, reality television, or your favorite vacation spots. 
This doesn't mean you have to dumb yourself down to flirt, but it does mean you have to relax and avoid the deep talk for a while.
Be playful. 
Being playful means not taking yourself too seriously, being a bit silly, playfully hitting your crush, or talking about something slightly offbeat or unexpected. 
It also means not putting too much pressure on yourself over the course of the conversation.

6
<b><b>Use <a href="/Communicate-With-Body-Language" title="Communicate With Body Language"><b>body language</b></a> to communicate your intentions.</b></b> Non-verbal cues can say a lot more about how you feel than what's actually coming out of your mouth, so make sure you're communicating how you feel. 
Try the following:

Keep your stance "open."  Don't cross your arms or legs, as these are generally signs that you wish to isolate yourself from the other person.
Turn your body toward the other person. 
Stand or sit so that you're facing the person you're flirting up. 
Angle your torso toward him or her, or point your feet in that direction.
Break the "touch barrier". 
Casually initiate physical contact by touching him or her on the forearm as you talk, or by "accidentally" walking too close and brushing up against the other person.

Play with your hair (girls). 
Playing with your hair is usually a sign of nervousness, which is a good thing if you like the other person — you almost <i>want</i> him or her to know you're nervous because it means you're interested. 
To consciously communicate this, slowly twirl a strand of hair around your finger as you talk.

7
<b>Break the touch barrier.</b> The first few times you touch your crush, be careful not to "trap" him or her. 
Depending on the area, the contact should be long enough to be more than accidental, but no more.

Avoid grasping a hand or arm, and instead try gestures such as brushing an imaginary speck of dirt off of their arm, or "accidentally" touching feet or knees without pulling away.
All of these touches can be rejected without humiliation or offense, so if your crush is not ready for that kind of contact, you will not be forcing them to reject you entirely.

8
<b>Compliment the other person early in the conversation.</b> It might seem too forward, but letting him or her know you're interested in dating before a solid friendship begins is the easiest way to detour around the friend-zone. 
Get confident, and <i>don't</i> let the opportunity slip by — you never know when you'll get another one.

Here are some techniques to try:

<i>Maintain eye contact while you're complimenting</i>. 
Looking away might accidentally make you seem insincere.

<i>Lower the tone and volume of your voice slightly</i>. 
Paying a compliment in a slightly lower register than your usual speaking voice makes it seem intimate and sexy. 
Plus, it might also coax the other person to come closer to hear you.

<i>Use your crush's other interests to your advantage</i>. 
If you know this person is dating (or interested in) someone else, you can use this to your advantage in a compliment.

<i>Try weaving the compliment into the conversation</i>. 
For instance, if the girl you like is talking about how she had a terrible day, you could say something like "I hate seeing someone as beautiful as you feel so unhappy. 
What can I do to help?"

<i>Be careful about complimenting looks</i>. 
A girl might like it if you notice her eyes, but she might label you as creepy if you say she has a nice figure too soon. 
Play it safe and stick to these physical features:

Eyes, Smile, Lips, Hair, Hands

9
<b>Keep your interactions short and sweet.</b> Remember that the key to creating demand is making supply scarce, so try to limit your interactions with the object of your flirtations. 
Don't talk to him or her every single day. 
Make it a special event and save it for a few times a week.

Don't let conversations drag on for more than 5 or 10 minutes. 
The longer they go on, the higher your odds of running into an awkward silence.
Let the other person come to you. 
After you've put in the work of starting up the interaction and sparking an interest, pull back a bit and see if he or she seeks <i>you</i> out for an interaction. 
This can be a good way to gauge interest, as well as build tension.

10
<b>Close the deal.</b> If your flirting has been successful so far, and you want to get to know the other person better, it's time to see if you can turn it into a date. 
Here are a few approaches:

Ask if the other person has plans at a later date. 
For instance, you might say, "So, what are you up to on Saturday night?" Try to keep this an open question, instead of one that requires a yes or no answer — you'll get more information that way. 
Don't ask someone what he or she is doing <i>tonight</i>, or even tomorrow. 
Try to schedule the date a few days out so that you don't come off as overly desperate.
Suggest a specific event and ask if he or she would like to come along. 
This is the best approach if you're trying to arrange a group date. 
You could say something like, "So a bunch of us were going to see a movie on Friday, and I'd really like it if you came with us."
Be straightforward. 
If you're feeling extra confident, go in for the kill without any pretense. 
For instance, you could say something like, "I'd really love to take you on a date. 
When are you free?"

<h3>Method 2 of 2:

Flirting by Texting or Chatting</h3>

1
<b>Keep your approach casual.</b> Don't let yourself get so <a href="/Not-Get-Nervous" title="Not Get Nervous">nervous</a> that you forget basic conversational skills. 
Instead, try to <a href="/Be-Calm" title="Be Calm">stay calm</a> and open the conversation in a low-pressure way. 
If you've never chatted with the person online before, you may even find an excuse for talking to him, like asking a question about homework or talking about a sports team you both like. 
If you're texting a person for the first time, make sure he or she knows who you are and that they don't feel creeped out. 
Here are some ways to start a conversation through text or chatting:

"Hey, how's it going?"
"Did you see/hear [insert event you both know about here]?"
"How's your week going?"

2
<a href="/Stop-Talking-About-Yourself" title="Stop Talking About Yourself"><b>Don't talk about yourself too much</b></a><b>.</b> The majority of people are most comfortable talking about themselves because it's a topic they know well. 
Instead of taking the easy way out and discussing <i>you</i> endlessly, encourage the other person to talk about him or herself. 
However, you can and should occasionally throw some personal facts in the person's direction to help them to ask questions about you in turn. 
The key is to leave it up to them to pursue an interest in things relevant to yourself.

This tactic actually serves two purposes: Not only does it keep the conversation going, but it allows you to find out more about your crush.
You don't have to possess prior information about the other person to do this step. 
If you don't know him or her very well yet, you can ask:

"How did your day go?"
"So, what do you do with your free time?"

If you do know the other person a bit, focus on a hobby or interest you're already aware of. 
For instance, maybe he's really into basketball, or you know she loves to read. 
"Did you see the game last night?" or "Have you read any good books lately?" would be great starts.

3
<b>Know when to press for more information.</b> You can keep the discussion lively and interesting without probing too deeply on personal topics. 
For instance, asking your crush what exactly he or she likes about running cross-country would be a great idea; asking him or her for more details on family relationships or close friendships would be too much, too soon. 
You can do it in a joking, flirtatious bantering way that doesn't feel too serious, or like you're interviewing the person. 
Here are some ways to ask for more information flirtatiously:

"So are you planning on spending all night online or do you have more exciting plans for this evening?"
"Are you going to kick some butt in tonight's game?"
"I've noticed the cute kitty in your profile picture. 
Is that who you spend most of your time with?"

4
<b><a href="/Compliment-People" title="Compliment People"><b>Compliment</b></a><b> your crush early in the conversation.</b></b> Don't chicken out and skip this step — it might seem difficult, but it's incredibly important. 
A compliment communicates that you're potentially interested in dating, and steers you away from the dreaded friend-zone.

If you skip paying your crush a compliment and simply keep the conversation on a friendly level, it might be too late next time. 
Here are some basic compliments you could use:

If you don't know your crush very well yet, but you're working on it, use a compliment oriented in this direction. 
Say something like, "It's so easy to talk to you," or "I kind of can't believe I'm getting to know someone as interesting as you."
Try weaving the compliment into the conversation. 
For instance, if the girl you like is talking about how she had a terrible day, you could say something like "I hate seeing someone as beautiful as you feel so unhappy. 
What can I do to help?"

5
<a href="/Be-Bold" title="Be Bold"><b>Be bold</b></a><b>.</b> If none of the suggestions above appeal to you, go for broke and pay your crush a bold compliment. 
Try these possibilities, using the adjective that fits your crush best or substituting your own:

"I hope you know you're gorgeous/beautiful/amazing/my favorite person to talk to/etc."
"Sorry if this is too forward, but I have to say that you're incredible/an amazing person/so beautiful/etc."

6
<b>Don't come on too strong.</b> Avoid loading compliments with feelings too early. 
Leaving a person slightly uncertain of the extent of your feelings for them can increase your attractiveness, giving you a bit of a mysterious edge. 
The point is not to make the person question whether you like them at all, but to make them wonder <i>how much</i> you like them. 
If you just openly say, "I have a big crush on you" or "I've always thought you were so hot," then you're taking the mystery out of the exchange.
Instead, you can send a text or a message that says something like, "You looked cute in your new sweater today" or another comment that is nice and flirtatious without giving it all away.

7
<b>Convince your crush to pursue you instead of having to do the work yourself.</b> Though flirting should let the person know that you like him or her, you shouldn't make it seem like you're doing all of the work. 
Instead, you should be just flattering enough so that the person knows you're interested, but leave him or her to wonder just how much you care. 
To achieve this, try phrasing compliments objectively rather than subjectively. 
Here are examples of objective vs subjective compliments:

<i>"I really like your eyes, they're so pretty."</i> On the surface, this compliment may seem fine, and it probably would be appreciated. 
However, a common flaw in phrasing a romantic compliment is to constantly use the words "I like/love *insert trait here*". 
They tell the person that they've succeeded in winning your heart. 
This is great if you've already built up a solid relationship, but early on it can make you seem "too easy".

<i>"You have great eyes, they're very pretty"</i>. 
Although technically both sentences are you conveying that you like the person's eyes, this one makes it more of an observation than a personal opinion. 
It implies that you find the person attractive but does not confirm it outright. 
As such, the receiver will feel both flattered and drawn to figure out how much attractive you find them.

8
<b>Tease gently.</b> Because you can't use body language to communicate over text or chat, you'll have to rely on your words to keep the mood light and fun. 
Rely on inside jokes (based on events you were both present for), sarcasm ("Yeah, I'm SURE you look like an ogre in the morning ;)"), and exaggeration ("You're probably a million times better at this than I am") in the beginning.
Make it clear that you're kidding. 
The drawback of using text to communicate is that you can't always read the emotion behind the words. 
If you're going to flirt with someone by teasing them, make extra sure that you're implying it's a joke. 
You can use winking smiley faces, all caps, or exclamation points to communicate this. 
Just don't overdo it with the emoticons or it'll begin to feel corny for the other person.
If you've already sent something that could be interpreted the wrong way, make your meaning crystal clear. 
Say something like "(joke)" or "jk" to make a quick save.

9
<b>Always leave your crush wanting more.</b> As much as you might want to text this person forever, it's best to bow out before the conversation goes stale (as all conversations are bound to do at some point). 
The best way to avoid an awkward pause is to leave before one happens. 
Ending the conversation on a good note will lead your conversational partner to look forward to the next time you can chat.

Set up your next interaction before you go. 
Throw out something like "Hey, so I'll see you around tomorrow?" or "I'll talk to you soon."
If you're chatting online, note that you enjoyed the conversation just before you leave. 
It doesn't have to be complicated — a simple "This was awesome" or "I had a good time talking to you" is enough. 
If you're texting, you can be a bit more casual about it.
Be careful not to over-compliment your crush. 
Your compliments will have a lot less meaning if you bestow them for every single positive trait the person has. 
Instead, reserve them for meaningful things that are important to the person, such as complimenting a skill they take pride in.

10
<b>Don't take it too seriously.</b> Keep in mind that flirting is supposed to be fun and try not to be crushed if your efforts aren't successful — not every interaction will be a perfect 10. 
Stay positive, and try again with someone else. 
As with anything else, flirting improves with practice. 
Flirting also doesn't have to have an endgame; not every flirtation ends in a date. 
Sometimes, you may just want to flirt for the fun of it, instead of hoping it will go somewhere.
Flirting can help you meet new people, feel more comfortable, and learn to mingle. 
You don't need to put any pressure on yourself to make it mean something or to be perfect.

Staff Answer
If you’re interested in taking your friendship to the next level, try teasing your friend in a good-spirited way. 
Gentle teasing and banter can be a good way to signal that you’re interested. 
You can also try complimenting them or making other small gestures to show you care, like surprising them with little gifts. 
If you get the sense they might be interested, have an honest conversation about how you feel.

It can be hard to avoid feeling a little awkward when you flirt, especially if you’re not sure how the other person feels. 
Do your best to act upbeat and confident, even if you’re nervous—acting confident can help you feel more confident! Be friendly and be yourself. 
If the other person acts uncomfortable or tells you they’re not interested, respect their wishes and dial back the flirting without acting pushy or resentful. 

Question
I know a guy likes me but he won't ask me out! What do I do?

Community Answer
Ask him out first! If you insist, you can <a href="/Get-Him-to-Make-a-Move">hint for him to make a move</a>, but if he's shy you might be waiting a long time.

Question
What if they ask you for your phone number?

Community Answer
Only give out your phone number to someone you're actually interested in. 
If someone seems sleazy or won't stop asking you, <a href="/Reject-a-Guy-Who-Wants-Your-Number">we have some ideas for you</a>.

Question
What should I do if he doesn't notice that I'm flirting?

Community Answer
Put your hand on his arm and look into his eyes. 
If he still doesn't figure it out, tell him straight out that you like him. 
It's less fun, but it gets you where you want to be.

Don't flirt with someone you're not romantically interested in, unless you are 100% sure that they are not romantically interested in you. 
Otherwise, you risk accidentally leading them on, which can lead to an embarrassing moment and uncomfortable interactions afterward.

Don't complain when flirting. 
Remember, the world does not revolve around you. 
If you complain too much, others will find you depressing and avoid you. 
This also goes for constantly insulting yourself, which is not <a href="/Be-Humble" title="Be Humble">humble</a> — it's another form of self-absorption.

Let go of any neediness you might have. 
Neediness is a precursor to obsessiveness, and obsessiveness is creepy. 
Needy people are imbalanced and unstable people because their happiness hinges too greatly on someone else, rather than a stable sense of self-worth. 
If you're projecting a vibe that you'll be devastated if a person doesn't want to be your friend or romantic partner, the lightheartedness that makes flirting fun will be extinguished.

Use flirting that is appropriate for the setting. 
Meeting at a <a href="/Find-Books-in-a-Library" title="Find Books in a Library">library</a> or loud <a href="/Dance" title="Dance">dance</a> hall, for example, might not be conducive to talking too much. 
In this case, <a href="/Smile" title="Smile">smile</a>, act interested, and wait for a spontaneous opportunity to meet at the punch bowl or in the lobby. 
Do not, however, follow them around for a while because you're too nervous to approach the person; this will make you seem creepy. 
Talk to them the first chance you get.

If you're flirting with a girl and thinking about breaking the touch barrier, test the waters with impeccable manners. 
For example, offer your hand when she might need to keep her balance, such as when she's getting into or out of a car, or when she's stepping over a puddle or any other uneven surface. 
How does she respond when you offer your hand? Does she seem receptive? Or does she hurry to let go?

Flirting is not appropriate everywhere. 
Funerals, for example, are generally not good places to flirt. 
Flirting in the workplace is also generally a no-no. 
If you happen to <a href="/Flirt-with-a-Guy-at-Work" title="Flirt with a Guy at Work">flirt</a> at <a href="/Dress-for-Work" title="Dress for Work">work,</a> be on your best behavior, and don't press the issue if the other person isn't interested.

If you don't feel comfortable <a href="/Ask-for-a-Phone-Number" title="Ask for a Phone Number">asking for their number</a>, try giving them your number. 
If they are truly interested in you, they will give you a call. 
You could also pass them your email address.

If you're a woman, try flipping your hair or doing the realistic version of the bend and snap. 
However be careful not to hit anyone in the face with your hair while doing this.

Don't use your phone (that means no texting) while you are flirting with someone. 
This shows that you are more interested in talking to somebody else who isn't there or that you are already involved in a relationship.

In some contexts, flirting may be unwanted. 
Unwanted flirtatious behaviour can be considered sexual harassment. 
Sexual harassment hurts its victim emotionally, and also might be illegal or at least violate your workplace or school policies.

<h3>5. Ignore your crush...but not for long. </h3>
It sounds counterintuitive, doesn't it? But imagine running into your crush and a group of their friends at McDonald's. 
Say hi to their friends first and strike up a convo. 
Your crush will feel the tiniest bit left out, until you turn to include them (and make their day).
<h3>6. Master the bump-and-flatter. </h3>
"Accidentally" run into a hottie at a crowded party. 
You can laugh and say, "Oh, sorry. 
I become a total klutz around cute people." They'll be immediately flattered and want to know more about you. 
That's when you introduce yourself and start a convo. 

<h3>7. Let them catch you looking at them. </h3>
I know, this seems so scary. 
Usually, when someone catches you staring you look away quickly so they don't realize you were literally drooling while watching them eat a hamburger. 
But, next time, try this instead. 
Gather up all the confidence you can. 
Then when your crush catches you staring, smile back at them, maybe even wink. 
It will prove that you're confident AF and will give them the excuse to come talk to you. 

<h3>8. Check out their clothes. </h3>
If they're wearing a band shirt or sport jersey, ask them about it. 
It will make you seem sincere and interested in their life, and it will start a nice conversation where you can learn more about each other. 

<h3>9. Be obvious sometimes. </h3>
Maybe you're playing frisbee in the park and you "accidentally" throw it toward the cuties near you. 
An exaggerated apology lets them know you're flirting on purpose (and in on the joke) and could lead to a conversation. 

<h3>10. Introduce your friend. </h3>
If you're too scared to start a convo alone, bring your friend with you and introduce her to your crush. 
This may seem weird, but sometimes it's easier to approach a person for someone else. 

<h3>11. Flirt before you see them. </h3>
Text, "You should wear that blue shirt tonight&mdash;it makes your eyes look amazing :) A flirty text lets your crush know you&rsquo;re thinking of them and will get them excited to see you later. 
Plus, seeing if they took your advice is a low-key way to gauge if they&rsquo;re interested in you.

<h3>12. Start off with something cheesy to break the ice. </h3>
If you're thinking of pick-up lines, the only ones that are coming to you are probably super lame recycled ones. 
"Did it hurt...when you fell from heaven?" Or: "How much does an elephant weight? Just enough to break the ice!" If you're trying to play it smooth but you're coming up short, embrace the awkwardness and just be cute as hell. 
You know Jughead Jones would appreciate it.
