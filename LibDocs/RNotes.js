'<h2>Startup : Initialization at Start of an R Session</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\nIn R, the startup mechanism is as follows.\n\nUnless --no-environ was given on the command line, R searches for site and user files to process for setting environment variables.  \nThe name of the site file is the one pointed to by the environment variable <code>R_ENVIRON</code>; if this is unset, <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/R_HOME?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::R_HOME">R_HOME</a>/etc/Renviron.site</code> is used (if it exists, which it does not in a "factory-fresh" installation).  \nThe name of the user file can be specified by the <code>R_ENVIRON_USER</code> environment variable; if this is unset, the files searched for are <code>.Renviron</code> in the current or in the user\'s home directory (in that order).  \nSee "Details" for how the files are read.\n\nThen R searches for the site-wide startup profile file of R code unless the command line option --no-site-file was given.  \nThe path of this file is taken from the value of the <code>R_PROFILE</code> environment variable (after <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/tilde%20expansion?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::tilde expansion">tilde expansion</a>).  \nIf this variable is unset, the default is <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/R_HOME?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::R_HOME">R_HOME</a>/etc/Rprofile.site</code>, which is used if it exists (which it does not in a "factory-fresh" installation). (it contains settings from the installer in a "factory-fresh" installation). This code is sourced into the base package.  \nUsers need to be careful not to unintentionally overwrite objects in base, and it is normally advisable to use <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/local?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::local">local</a></code> if code needs to be executed: see the examples.\n\nThen, unless --no-init-file was given, R searches for a user profile, a file of R code.  \nThe path of this file can be specified by the <code>R_PROFILE_USER</code> environment variable (and <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/tilde%20expansion?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::tilde expansion">tilde expansion</a> will be performed).  \nIf this is unset, a file called <code>.Rprofile</code> is searched for in the current directory or in the user\'s home directory (in that order).  \nThe user profile file is sourced into the workspace.\n\nNote that when the site and user profile files are sourced only the base package is loaded, so objects in other packages need to be referred to by e.g.<code>utils::dump.frames</code> or after explicitly loading the package concerned.\n\nR then loads a saved image of the user workspace from <code>.RData</code> in the current directory if there is one (unless --no-restore-data or --no-restore was specified on the command line).\n\nNext, if a function <code>.First</code> is found on the search path, it is executed as <code>.First()</code>.  \nFinally, function <code>.First.sys()</code> in the base package is run.  \nThis calls <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/require?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::require">require</a></code> to attach the default packages specified by <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/options?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::options">options</a>("defaultPackages")</code>.  \nIf the methods package is included, this will have been attached earlier (by function <code>.OptRequireMethods()</code>) so that namespace initializations such as those from the user workspace will proceed correctly.\n\nA function <code>.First</code> (and <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/.Last?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::.Last">.Last</a></code>) can be defined in appropriate <code>.Rprofile</code> or <code>Rprofile.site</code> files or have been saved in <code>.RData</code>.  \nIf you want a different set of packages than the default ones when you start, insert a call to <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/options?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::options">options</a></code> in the <code>.Rprofile</code> or <code>Rprofile.site</code> file.  \nFor example, <code>options(defaultPackages = character())</code> will attach no extra packages on startup (only the base package) (or set <code>R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL</code> as an environment variable before running R).  \nUsing <code>options(defaultPackages = "")</code> or <code>R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=""</code> enforces the R <em>system</em> default.\n\nOn front-ends which support it, the commands history is read from the file specified by the environment variable <code>R_HISTFILE</code> (default <code>.Rhistory</code> in the current directory) unless --no-restore-history or --no-restore was specified.\n\nThe command-line option --vanilla implies --no-site-file, --no-init-file, --no-environ and (except for <code>R CMD</code>) --no-restore Under Windows, it also implies --no-Rconsole, which prevents loading the <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/Rconsole?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::Rconsole">Rconsole</a></code> file.\n<h3>Arguments</h3><h3>Details</h3>Note that there are two sorts of files used in startup: <em>environment files</em> which contain lists of environment variables to be set, and <em>profile files</em> which contain R code.\n\nLines in a site or user environment file should be either comment lines starting with <code>#</code>, or lines of the form <code>name=value</code>. The latter sets the environmental variable <code>name</code> to <code>value</code>, overriding an existing value.  \nIf <code>value</code> contains an expression of the form <code>${foo-bar}</code>, the value is that of the environmental variable <code>foo</code> if that exists and is set to a non-empty value, otherwise <code>bar</code>.  \n(If it is of the form <code>${foo}</code>, the default is <code>""</code>.)  This construction can be nested, so <code>bar</code> can be of the same form (as in <code>${foo-${bar-blah}}</code>).  \nNote that the braces are essential: for example <code>$HOME</code> will not be interpreted.\n\nLeading and trailing white space in <code>value</code> are stripped. <code>value</code> is then processed in a similar way to a Unix shell: in particular the outermost level of (single or double) quotes is stripped, and backslashes are removed except inside quotes.\n\nOn systems with sub-architectures (mainly Windows), the files <code>Renviron.site</code> and <code>Rprofile.site</code> are looked for first in architecture-specific directories, e.g.<code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/R_HOME?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::R_HOME">R_HOME</a>/etc/i386/Renviron.site</code>. And e.g.<code>.Renviron.i386</code> will be used in preference to <code>.Renviron</code>.\n<h3>See Also</h3>For the definition of the "home" directory on Windows see the <code>rw-FAQ</code> Q2.14.  \nIt can be found from a running R by <u>Sys.getenv("R_USER")</u>.\n\n<code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/.Last?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::.Last">.Last</a></code> for final actions at the close of an R session. <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/commandArgs?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::commandArgs">commandArgs</a></code> for accessing the command line arguments.\n\nThere are examples of using startup files to set defaults for graphics devices in the help for <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/windows.options?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::windows.options">windows.options</a></code>. <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/X11?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::X11">X11</a></code> and <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/quartz?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::quartz">quartz</a></code>.\n\n<em>An Introduction to R</em> for more command-line options: those affecting memory management are covered in the help file for <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/Memory?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::Memory">Memory</a>.\n\n<code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/readRenviron?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::readRenviron">readRenviron</a></code> to read <code>.Renviron</code> files.\n\nFor profiling code, see <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/Rprof?package=base&version=3.5.0" data-mini-rdoc="base::Rprof">Rprof</a></code>.\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n# NOT RUN {\n## Example ~/.Renviron on Unix\nR_LIBS=~/R/library\nPAGER=/usr/local/bin/less\n\n## Example .Renviron on Windows\nR_LIBS=C:/R/library\nMY_TCLTK="c:/Program Files/Tcl/bin"\n\n## Example of setting R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES (from R CMD check)\nR_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=\'utils,grDevices,graphics,stats\'\n# this loads the packages in the order given, so they appear on\n# the search path in reverse order.\n\n## Example of .Rprofile\noptions(width=65, digits=5)\noptions(show.signif.stars=FALSE)\nsetHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),       function(...) grDevices::ps.options(horizontal=FALSE))\nset.seed(1234)\n.First = function() cat("/n   Welcome to R!/n/n")\n.Last = function()  cat("/n   Goodbye!/n/n")\n\n## Example of Rprofile.site\nlocal({ # add MASS to the default packages, set a CRAN mirror old = getOption("defaultPackages"); r = getOption("repos") r["CRAN"] = "http://my.local.cran" options(defaultPackages = c(old, "MASS"), repos = r) ## (for Unix terminal users) set the width from COLUMNS if set cols = Sys.getenv("COLUMNS") if(nzchar(cols)) options(width = as.integer(cols)) # interactive sessions get a fortune cookie (needs fortunes package) if (interactive())   fortunes::fortune()\n})\n\n## if .Renviron contains\nFOOBAR="coo/bar"doh/ex"abc/"def\'"\n\n## then we get\n# > cat(Sys.getenv("FOOBAR"), "/n")\n# coo/bardoh/exabc"def\'\n# }\n',

You might think you wouldn\'t be silly enough to use a for loop with an empty data frame, but once you start writing your own functions, there\'s no telling what the input will be.\nA better method is to use the seq_along() function.\nif you grow the for loop at each iteration (e.g. using c()), your for loop will be very slow.\nA general way of creating an empty vector of given length is the vector() function. \nIt has two arguments: the type of the vector ("logical", "integer", "double", "character", etc.) and the length of the vector.\nThen, at each iteration of the loop you must store the output in the corresponding entry of the output vector, i.e. assign the result to output[[i]]. (You might ask why we are using double brackets here when output is a vector. It\'s primarily for generalizability: this subsetting will work whether output is a vector or a list.)\n\nA time series can be thought of as a vector or matrix of numbers, \nalong with some information about what times those numbers were recorded.

However, it differs for <code>[</code> in that, indexing with <code>[</code> <span class="redword">will return us a data frame</span> but the other two will <span class="redword">reduce it into a vector</span>.\n\n<h3>Accessing like a matrix</h3>\nData frames can be accessed like a matrix by providing index for row and column.\n\nTo illustrate this, we use datasets already available in R. Datasets that are available can be listed with the command <code>library(help = "datasets")</code>.\n\nWe will use the <code>trees</code> dataset which contains <code>Girth</code>, <code>Height</code> and <code>Volume</code> for Black Cherry Trees.\n\nA data frame can be examined using functions like <code>str()</code> and <code>head()</code>.\n\n<code>> str(trees)\n\'data.frame\':   31 obs. of 3 variables:\n$ Girth : num  8.3 8.6 8.8 10.5 10.7 10.8 11 11 11.1 11.2 ...\n$ Height: num  70 65 63 72 81 83 66 75 80 75 ...\n$ Volume: num  10.3 10.3 10.2 16.4 18.8 19.7 15.6 18.2 22.6 19.9 ...\n> head(trees,n=3)\nGirth Height Volume\n1   8.3     70   10.3\n2   8.6     65   10.3\n3   8.8     63   10.2\n</code>\nWe can see that <code>trees</code> is a data frame with 31 rows and 3 columns. We also display the first 3 rows of the data frame.\n\nNow we proceed to access the data frame like a matrix.\n\n<code>> trees[2:3,]    # select 2nd and 3rd row\nGirth Height Volume\n2   8.6     65   10.3\n3   8.8     63   10.2\n> trees[trees$Height > 82,]    # selects rows with Height greater than 82\nGirth Height Volume\n6   10.8     83   19.7\n17  12.9     85   33.8\n18  13.3     86   27.4\n31  20.6     87   77.0\n> trees[10:12,2]\n[1] 75 79 76\n</code>\nWe can see in the last case that the returned type is a vector since we extracted data from a single column.\n\nThis behavior can be avoided by passing the argument <code>drop=FALSE</code> as follows.\n\n<code>> trees[10:12,2, drop = FALSE]\nHeight\n10     75\n11     79\n12     76\n</code>\n\n# access first row by index, returns a data.frame\nx[1,]\n\n# access first row by "name", returns a data.frame\n> x["1",]\n\n# access first row returns a vector\nuse as.numeric\nstr(as.numeric(wAveTable["1",]))\n\nunlist which keeps the names.\nstr(unlist(wAveTable["1",]))\n\nuse transpose and as.vector\nstr(as.vector(t(wAveTable["1",])[,1]))\n\nuse only as.vector cannot convert to vector\nstr(as.vector(wAveTable["1",]))\n\n# convert dataframe to matrix\ndata.matrix(wAveTable)\n',

The two most common ways to do this are through \n<a href="http://jupyter.org/" data-href="http://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a> or \n<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html" data-href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R Notebooks</a>.\nEssentially, a notebook (of either kind) allows you to run R code block by block, and show output block my block. \nWe can see on the left that we are summarizing the data, then checking the output. \nAfter, we plot the data, then view the plot. \nAll of these actions take place within the notebook, and it makes analyzing both output and code a simultaneous process. \nThis can help data scientists collaborate and ease the friction of having to open up someone’s code and understand what it does. \nAdditionally, notebooks also make data science \n<em>reproducible</em>, which gives validity to whatever data science work you do!\n<h4>Honorable Mention: Git</h4>\nLast but not least, I want to mention Git. \nGit is a \n<em>version control</em> system. \nSo why use it? Well, it’s in the name. \nGit allows you to keep versions of the code you are working on. \nIt also allows multiple people to work on the same project and allows those changes to be attributed to certain contributors. \nYou’ve probably heard of \n<a href="http://www.github.com" data-href="http://www.github.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>, undoubtedly one of the most popular git servers.\nYou can visit my website at \n<a href="http://www.peterxeno.com" data-href="http://www.peterxeno.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">www.peterxeno.com</a> and my Github at \n<a href="https://github.com/peterxeno" data-href="https://github.com/peterxeno" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">www.github.com/peterxeno</a>\n',

'<h2>Writing data to a file</h2>\n<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>\nYou want to write data to a file.\n\n<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>\n<h3 id="writing-to-a-delimited-text-file">Writing to a delimited text file</h3>\nThe easiest way to do this is to use <code>write.csv()</code>. By default, <code>write.csv()</code> includes row names, but these are usually unnecessary and may cause confusion.\n\n<code># A sample data frame\ndata = read.table(header=TRUE, text=\'\n subject sex size\n       1   M    7\n       2   F    NA\n       3   F    9\n       4   M   11\n \')\n\n# Write to a file, suppress row names\nwrite.csv(data, "data.csv", row.names=FALSE)\n\n# Same, except that instead of "NA", output blank cells\nwrite.csv(data, "data.csv", row.names=FALSE, na="")\n\n# Use tabs, suppress row names and column names\nwrite.table(data, "data.csv", sep="/t", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE) \n</code>\n\n<h3>Saving in R data format</h3>\n<code>write.csv()</code> and <code>write.table()</code> are best for interoperability with other data analysis programs. They will not, however, preserve special attributes of the data structures, such as whether a column is a character type or factor, or the order of levels in factors. In order to do that, it should be written out in a special format for R.\n\nBelow are are three primary ways of doing this:\n\nThe first method is to output R source code which, when run, will re-create the object. This should work for most data objects, but it may not be able to faithfully re-create some more complicated data objects.\n\n<code># Save in a text format that can be easily loaded in R\ndump("data", "data.Rdmpd")\n# Can save multiple objects:\ndump(c("data", "data1"), "data.Rdmpd")\n\n# To load the data again: \nsource("data.Rdmpd")\n# When loaded, the original data names will automatically be used.\n</code>\n\nThe next method is to write out individual data objects in RDS format. This format can be binary or ASCII. Binary is more compact, while ASCII will be more efficient with version control systems like Git.\n\n<code># Save a single object in binary RDS format\nsaveRDS(data, "data.rds")\n# Or, using ASCII format\nsaveRDS(data, "data.rds", ascii=TRUE)\n\n# To load the data again:\ndata = readRDS("data.rds")\n</code>\n\nIt’s also possible to save multiple objects into an single file, using the RData format.\n\n<code># Saving multiple objects in binary RData format\nsave(data, file="data.RData")\n# Or, using ASCII format\nsave(data, file="data.RData", ascii=TRUE)\n# Can save multiple objects\nsave(data, data1, file="data.RData")\n\n# To load the data again:\nload("data.RData")\n</code>\nAn important difference between <code>saveRDS()</code> and <code>save()</code> is that, with the former, when you <code>readRDS()</code> the data, you specify the name of the object, and with the latter, when you <code>load()</code> the data, the original object names are automatically used. Automatically using the original object names can sometimes simplify a workflow, but it can also be a drawback if the data object is meant to be distributed to others for use in a different environment.\n',

You may want to change this if you re-size the window that R is running in.\ndigits	controls the number of digits to print when printing numeric values. It is a suggestion only.\neditor	sets the default text editor, e.g., for edit. Set from the environment variable VISUAL on UNIX.\npager	the (stand-alone) program used for displaying ASCII files on R\'s console. Defaults to \n$R_HOME/bin/pager\' on UNIX.\nbrowser	default HTML browser used by help.start() on UNIX.\nmailer	default mailer used by bug.report(). can be "none".\ncontrasts	the default contrasts used in model fitting such as with aov or lm. A character vector of length two, the first giving the function to be used with unordered factors and the second the function to be used with ordered factors.\nexpressions	sets a limit on the number of nested expressions that will be evaluated. This is especially important on the Macintosh since stack overflow is likely if this is set too high.\nkeep.source	When TRUE, the default, the source code for functions loaded by is stored in their "source" attribute, allowing comments to be kept in the right places. This does not apply to functions loaded by library.\nna.action	the name of a function for treating missing values (NA\'s) for certain situations.\npapersize	the paper format used for graphics printing; currently read-only, set by environment variable R_PAPERSIZE, or in \nconfig.site\'.\nprintcmd	the command used for graphics printing; currently read-only, set by environment variable R_PRINTCMD, or in \nconfig.site\'.\nshow.signif.stars, show.coef.Pvalues	logical, affecting P value printing, see print.coefmat.\nts.eps	the relative tolerance for certain time series (ts) computations.\nerror	an expression governing the handling of non-catastrophic errors such as those generated by stop as well as by signals and internally detected errors. The default expression is NULL: see stop for the behaviour in that case. The function dump.frames provides one alternative that allows post-mortem debugging.\nshow.error.messages	a logical. Should error messages be printed? Intended for use with try or a user-installed error handler.\nwarn	sets the handling of warning messages. If warn is negative all warnings are ignored. If warn is zero (the default) warnings are stored until the top–level function returns. If fewer than 10 warnings were signalled they will be printed otherwise a message saying how many (max 50) were signalled. A top–level variable called last.warning is created and can be viewed through the function warnings. If warn is one, warnings are printed as they occur. If warn is two or larger all warnings are turned into errors.\necho	logical. Only used in non-interactive mode, when it controls whether input is echoed. Command-line options --quiet and --slave set this initially to FALSE.\nverbose	logical. Should R report extra information on progress? Set to TRUE by the command-line option --verbose.\ndevice	a character string giving the default device for that session.\nCRAN	The URL of the preferred CRAN node for use by update.packages.

'<h2>Using R – Calling C code ‘Hello World!’</h2>\nsites contain useful information for an R-calling-C beginner:\n<a href="http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/rc/">Calling C and Fortran from R</a>\n<a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/docs/interface.pdf">An Introduction to the .C Interface to R</a>\n<a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~liu105/STAT598G_lab/Rcourse94up.pdf">Calling other languages from R</a>\n\n<a href="http://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/calling-c-code-from-r/">Calling C from R</a>\n<a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~liu105/STAT598G_lab/Rcourse94up.pdf">Calling C Functions from R</a>\n<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#System-and-foreign-language-interfaces">System and foreign language interfaces</a>\n\n<h3>C code</h3>\nJust to start at the very beginning here is the classic introduction to C — helloA.c:\n\n#include >stdio.h>main() {  printf("Hello World!/n");}#include >stdio.h>\nmain() {\n  printf("Hello World!/n");\n}#include >stdio.h>\nmain() {\n  printf("Hello World!/n");\n}\n\nOn Unix/Linux systems you can compile this exciting bit of C code with make which will take care of starting up the compiler with the right compiler flags and arguments.\n\nThen just run our new executable at the command line;\n$ make helloAcc     helloA.c   -o helloA$ ./helloAHello World!$ make helloA\ncc     helloA.c   -o helloA\n$ ./helloA\nHello World!$ make helloA\ncc     helloA.c   -o helloA\n$ ./helloA\nHello World!\n\nTo make this executable easier to run from our R session, we’ll create a file named wrappers.R where we will put a wrapper function that will invoke this C code:\n\n# Wrapper function to invoke "helloA" at the shell.helloA >- function() {  system(paste(getwd(),"helloA",sep="/"))}# Wrapper function to invoke "helloA" at the shell.\nhelloA >- function() {\n  system(paste(getwd(),"helloA",sep="/"))\n}# Wrapper function to invoke "helloA" at the shell.\nhelloA >- function() {\n  system(paste(getwd(),"helloA",sep="/"))\n}\n\nAnd now we can start up R and try out our new function.\n\n> source(\'wrappers.R\')> helloA()Hello World!> source(\'wrappers.R\')\n> helloA()\nHello World!> source(\'wrappers.R\')\n> helloA()\nHello World!\n\nOK, that example was included primarily for those out there who haven’t seen C code in a while.\nBut it walked us through all the necessary steps that we will repeat as things get more complicated:  write C code; compile; write R wrapper function; invoke from R.\nIn the example above, we didn’t accept any arguments or return anything to R.\nWe also started up two separate processes (R and ‘helloA’), each with their own memory space.\nOne of the main reasons to call C code directly from R is to avoid system calls and keep our data in a single memory space.\nThe bigger your datasets and the more often you call your C code, the more important this becomes.\n\n<h3>Crawling with C</h3>\nThe most basic method for calling C code from R is to use the .C() function described in the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#System-and-foreign-language-interfaces">System and foreign language interfaces</a> section of the Writing R Extensions manual.\n\nOther methods exist including the .Call() and .External() functions but we’ll stick with the simplest version for this post.\n',

'<h2>Visualization with R and JavaScript</h2>\n<a href="R Graph Gallery.html" class="goldbut red bluegrad">R Graph Gallery</a>\nYou can make use of numerous JavaScript libraries that help in creating web functionality for dynamic data visualizations for R.\nHere I will be elaborating some of those tools like D3, Highchart, and leaflet. \nYou can quickly implement these tools in your R and program knowledge of JavaScript is not mandatory for this.\nAs I have already mentioned that R is an open source analytical software, it can create high dimensional data visualizations. \nGgplot2 is a standout among the most downloaded bundle that has helped R to accomplish best quality level as a data visualization tool.\nJavascript then again is a scripting dialect in which R can be consolidated to make data visualisation. \nNumerous javascript libraries can help in creating great intuitive plots, some of them are d3.Js, c3.js, vis.js, plotly.js, sigma.js, dygraphs.js.\nHTM widgets act as a bridge between R and JavaScript. \nIt is the principal support for building connectors between two languages. \nThe flow of a program for HTM widgets r can be visualized as under:\n<U+2022> Information is perused into R\n<U+2022> Data is handled (and conceivably controlled) by R\n<U+2022> Data is changed over to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) arrange\n<U+2022> Information is bound to JavaScript\n<U+2022> Information is prepared (and conceivably controlled) by JavaScript\n<U+2022> Information is mapped to plotting highlights and rendered\nNow let us discuss some of the data visualization packages:\n<k><U+2022> r d3 package</k>\nData-driven documents or d3 is one of the popular JavaScript visualization libraries. \nD3 can produce visualization for almost everything including choropleths, scatter plots, graphs, network visualizations and many more. \nMultiple R packages are using only D3 plotting methods. \nYou can refer r d3 package tutorials to learn about this.\n\n<a href="https://datatricks.co.uk/creating-a-d3-js-bar-chart-in-r" class="whitebut ">Creating a D3.js bar chart in R</a>\n\n<a

href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/gallery.html" class="whitebut ">r2d3 examples</a>\n<U+2022> <k>ggplot2</k> \n \n It is really very easy to create plots in R, but you may ask me whether it is same for creating custom plots, the answer is “yes”, and that is the primary motivation behind why ggplot came into existence. \nWith ggplot, you can make complex multi-layered designs effectively.\nHere you can start plotting with axes then add points and lines. \nBut the only drawback that it has it is relatively slower than base R, and new developers might find it difficult to learn.\n<U+2022> <k>Leaflet</k>\nThe leaflet has found its profound use in GIS (mapping), this is an open source library. \nThe R packages that backings this is composed and kept up by RStudio and ports. \nUsing this developer can create pop up text, custom zoom levels, tiles, polygon, planning and many more.\nThe ggmap bundle of javaScript can be utilised for the estimation of the latitude and longitude.\n<U+2022> <k>Lattice</k>\nLattice helps in plotting visualized multivariate data. \nHere you can have tilled plots that help in comparing values or subgroups of a given variable. \nHere you will discover numerous lattice highlights has been acquired as utilizes grid package for its usage. \nThe underlying logic used by lattice is very much similar to base R.\n<k><U+2022> visNetwork</k>\nFor the graphical representation of nodes and edges, the visual network is referred. \nVis.js is a standout amongst the most famous library among numerous that can do this sort of plotting. \nvisNetwork is the related with R package for this.\nNetwork plots ought to be finished remembering nodes and edges. \nFor visNetwork, these two should be separated into two different data frames one for the nodes and the other\n<k><U+2022> Highcarter</k>\nThis is another visualization tool which is very similar to D3. \nYou can use this tool for a variety of plots like line, spline, arealinerange, column range, polar chart and many more. \nFor the commercial use of Highcarter, you need to get a license while for the non-commercial you don’t need one.\nHighcarter library can be accessed very easily using various chart () functions. \nUsing this function, you can create a plot in a single task. \nThis function is very much similar to qplot() of ggplot2 of D3. \nchart () can produce different types of scenarios depending on the data inputs and specifications.\n<k><U+2022> RColor Brewer</k>\nWith this package, you can use color for your plots, graphs, and maps. \nThis package works nicely with schemes.\n<k><U+2022> Plotly</k>\nIt is a well distinguish podium for data visualization that works inordinately with R and Python notebook. \nIt has similarity with the high career as both are known for interactive plotting. \nBut here you get some extra as it offers something that most of the package don’t like contour plots, candlestick chart, and 3d charts.\n<U+2022> <k>SunTrust</k>\nIt is the way for representing data visualization as it nicely describes the sequence of events. \nThe diagram that it produces speaks about itself. \nYou don’t need an explanation for the chart as it is self-explanatory.\n<U+2022> <k>RGL</k>\nFor creating three-dimensional plots in R you should check out RGL. \nIt has comparability with lattice, and on the off chance that you are an accomplished R developer you will think that its simple.\n<k><U+2022> Threejs</k>\nThis is an R package and an HTML widget that helps in incorporating several data visualization from the JavaScript library.\nSome of the visualization function three are as follows:\n<U+2022> Graphjs: this is used for implementing 3D interactive data visualization. \nThis function accepts igraph as the first argument. \nThis manages definition for nodes and edges.\n<U+2022> Scatterplot3js: this function is used for creating three dimensional scatter plot.\n<U+2022> Globejs: this function of JavaScript is used for plotting surface maps and data points on earth.\n<U+2022> <k>Shiny</k>\nThe most significant benefit of JavaScript visualization is it can be implanted voluntarily into the web application. \nThey can be injected into several frameworks, one of such context of R development is shiny.\nShiny is created and maintained by R Studio. \nIt is a <a href="https://www.cuelogic.com/custom-software-development" data-href="https://www.cuelogic.com/custom-software-development" target="_blank">software application development</a> instrument, to a great extent employed for making wise interfaces with R. \nR shiny tutorial will take in more about shiny.\nShiny is a podium for facilitating R web development.\nConnecting R with javascript using libraries\nWeb scuffling has formed into an original piece of examination as through this movement you can pucker your required information. \nBut the data should be extracted before any web developer start to insert javascript render content into the web page. \nTo help in such situation R has an excellent package called V8 which acts as an interface to JavaScript. \nR v8 is the most generally utilized capacity utilized for interfacing r in javascript. \nYou can undoubtedly implement JS code in R without parting the current session. \nThe library function used for this is rvest().\nTo run the JavaScript in R, we need a context handler, within that context handler you can start programming. \nThen you can export the R data into JavaScript.\nSome other JavaScript libraries that help in analytical programming such as Linear Regression, SVMs etc. \nare as follows:\n<U+2022> Brain.js()\n<U+2022> Mljs\n<U+2022> Webdnn\n<U+2022> Convnetjs\n\n<a

'<h2>FastRWeb</h2>\nFastRWeb is an infrastructure that allows any webserver to use R scripts for generating content on the fly, such as web pages or graphics. \nURLs are mapped to scripts and can have optional arguments that are passed to the R function run from the script. \nFor example http://my.server/cgi-bin/R/foo.png?n=100 would cause FastRWeb to look up a script foo.png.R, source it and call run(n="100"). \nSo for example the script could be as simple as\n\nrun = function(n=10, ...) {\n   p = WebPlot(800, 600)\n   n = as.integer(n)\n   plot(rnorm(n), rnorm(n), col=2, pch=19)\n   p\n}\nThis can potentially then be called using JavaScript to dynamically load images and display them.\n\n<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22179512/suggestions-needed-for-building-r-server-rest-apis-that-i-can-call-from-externa/29537593#29537593">building R server REST API\'s that I can call from external app</a>',

'<h2>shiny and rpanel - a quick comparison</h2>\n\nShiny is a package from RStudio that lets you produce interactive web pages. \nYou build a page with some control widgets and a handler that does something dependent on the value of those widgets. \nYou can build your interface programmatically or create a boilerplate html page that gets filled in by control and output widgets.\n\nA conceptually similar pattern is implemented by the rpanel package, but this uses the tcltk toolkit. \nA panel is created, control widgets added, and callbacks on the controls can run R code to, for example, update a plot.\n\nqq plot example\nHere\'s the rpanel version:\n\nrequire(rpanel)\n# box-cox transform\nbc.fn = function(y, lambda) {\n    if (abs(lambda) < 0.001) \n        z = log(y) else z = (y^lambda - 1)/lambda\n}\n\n# qqplot of transformed data\nqq.draw = function(panel) {\n    z = bc.fn(panel$y, panel$lambda)\n    qqnorm(z, main = paste("lambda =", round(panel$lambda, 2)))\n    panel\n}\n\n# create a new panel with some initial data\npanel = rp.control(y = exp(rnorm(50)), lambda = 1)\n\n# add a slider that calls qq.draw on change\nrp.slider(panel, lambda, -2, 2, qq.draw)\n\nRun these functions and you should see a slider and a graphics window. \nMove the slider to modify the plot.\nNote that this might not work too well under RStudio because of the way the embedded RStudio graphics device captures output.\n\nAnd here is the shiny version, which comes in two files living in their own folder.  ui.R and server.R\n\nFirst qqplot/ui.R:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n# this defines our page layout\nshinyUI(pageWithSidebar(\n  headerPanel("qqplot example"),\n  sidebarPanel(\n  # a slider called \'lambda\':\n    sliderInput("lambda", "Lambda value", min = -2, max = 2, step=0.01, value = 0)\n  ),\n  mainPanel(\n    # the main panel is the plotted output from qqplot:\n    plotOutput("qqPlot")\n  )\n))\n\nand qqplot/server.R:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nshinyServer(function(input, output) {\n    # b-c transform\n    bc.fn = function(y, lambda) {\n        if (abs(lambda) < 0.001) \n            z = log(y) else z = (y^lambda - 1)/lambda\n    }\n    # initial data\n    y = exp(rnorm(50))\n    # here\'s the qqplot method:\n    output$qqPlot = reactivePlot(function() {\n        z = bc.fn(y, input$lambda)\n        qqnorm(z, main = paste("lambda =", round(input$lambda, 2)))\n    })\n})\n\nWith that done, launch the app with:\n\nrunApp("qqplot")\nthat should open up the page in your web browser. \nHit break, stop, or control-C to quit.\n\nNotes\nThe rpanel plot updates as you drag the slider, whereas shiny updates only when you let go of the slider.\n\nI find that when I hit Control-C and break a running shiny app, then my tcltk windows go all unresponsive until I quit R and start again. \nThreading issues? This is on Linux. \nI\'ve always had problems with tcltk widgets going unresponsive on me, or ending up unkillable.\n\nThe shiny UI looks, well, “shiny”, but the rpanel interface looks a bit old and not very exciting (if you can get excited by user interfaces).\n\nUsing the tkrplot package, you can build integrated rpanel packages with controls and plots in the same window. \nWithout it, you are stuck with separate graphics and control windows.\n\nWhich should I use?\nHow do I know?! Shiny looks better, but I do like the update on drag of rpanel - it gives you much better feedback as you control the plot. \nMaybe this can be done in shiny with some additional work.\n\nI don\'t really like the two-file method of shiny. \nLooking at the code I see the files just get sourced in, so conceivably it could be possible to run shiny apps just by specifying the shinyServer and shinyUI functions - but shiny monitors the server.R and ui.R file for changes and updates the application, which is quite nice.\n\nSo there\'s the basic existential dilemma. \nChoice. \nI can even throw some more things into the mix if you want - there\' RServe, or RApache with gWidgetsWWW and probably many many more. \nI\'m sure we can all agree that the days of needing Java and Apache Tomcat to deploy R applications to the web are now over (http://sysbio.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/Rwui/tutorial/quick_tour.html).\n\nI might try and implement some more of the rpanel examples in shiny shortly. \nOr why don\'t you have a go, and publish your works here?\n',

'<h2>常用統計檢驗法簡介</h2>\n\nT.test(又稱 T 檢定、T檢驗、t.test，以下簡稱T檢驗)\nT檢驗主要用於檢定樣本的平均值，這是一項重點。\n\n如果要看一個樣本的平均是否等於某值，要用 T 檢驗。\n\n如果要看兩個樣本的平均是否相等，要用 T 檢驗。\n\nT 檢驗分成三種類別\n1.單樣本T檢驗(One smaple T test)\n2.獨立雙樣本T檢驗\n3.配對雙樣本T檢驗\n\n要看 30 個男生的身高是否等於 180，用單樣本T檢驗。\n[R語法:t.test(樣本,mu=平均)]\n\n要看 A 班與 B 班男生身高是否相等，用獨立雙樣本T檢驗。\n[R語法:t.test(A樣本,B樣本)]\n\n要看 30 個男生吃藥前與吃藥後身高是否相等，用配對雙樣本T檢驗\n[R語法:t.test(A樣本,B樣本,paired=TURE)]\n\n每一種 T 檢驗都還可以再分成雙尾與單尾檢驗。\n[R語法:t.test(樣本,mu=平均,alternative= "two.sided")]\n\ntwo.sided代表等於，就是雙尾的意思，也可以改成單尾的大於"greater"或是單尾的小於"less"。\n\n重點只有"檢驗平均等於某值時"是雙尾，"檢驗平均小於某值時"是單尾，"檢驗平均大於某值時"是單尾。\n請看到這裡後不要再講單尾或是雙尾了，一點意義也沒有，講大於等於小於就好了。\n但Eecel沒有大於小於的選項，只有單尾雙尾，因此要自己判斷是大於還是小於(從樣本平均看即可)。\n[Eecel語法:TTEST(A樣本,B樣本,2,2)]，2代表雙尾，改成1就變成單尾。\n\n要看 30 個男生的身高是否大於 180，用單樣本T檢驗\n[R語法:t.test(樣本,mu=180),alternative="greater"]\n\n要看 A 班與 B 班男生身高差異是否小於 30，用獨立雙樣本T檢驗\n[R語法:t.test(A,B,mu=30,alternative="less")]\n\n要看 30 個男生吃藥前與吃藥後身高是否相等，用配對雙樣本T檢驗\n[R語法:t.test(A,B,mu=30,paired=T)]\n[Eecel語法:TTEST(A樣本,B樣本,2,1)]\n\n其中獨立雙樣本T檢驗(Welch Two smaple T test)還細分成變異數相等或變異數不相等兩種，這要看你母體與取樣的方法，如果不確定，嚴格一點是認為不相等的。\n\n變異數相等\n[R語法:t.test(A,B,mu=0,var.equal=T)]\n\n變異數不相等\n[R語法:t.test(A,B,mu=0,var.equal=F)]\n\n<h3>卡方檢定 chi-square test(以下簡稱卡方檢定)</h3>\n卡方檢驗用於確認樣本是否符合某種分配\n骰子丟一百次，每面的機率是否為1/6</a>)，\n或是兩個屬性之間是否有所關聯(男生是否比較容易選擇藍色商品)。\n\n這其實是一樣的概念，假設兩個屬性之間無關，其分佈上應該會呈現隨機;\n如果兩個屬性有關，例如男生喜歡藍色商品，在同樣的其況下，男生買藍色商品的次數會比男生買紅色商品的次數多，也就是不符合隨機的分配(理論上無關的話次數會一樣多)。\n\n卡方檢定分成三種\n1.適合度檢定（Goodness of fit test）\n2.獨立性檢定（Test of independence）\n3.同質性檢定 (Test of Homogeneity)\n\n其實獨立性與同質性檢定是同一個東西，只是問法不一樣而已卡方適合度檢定用來檢驗樣本是否服從某種分佈，這種分佈你的心裡要有底，比方隨機(丟骰子各面是1/6)，孟德爾的紅花白花是3:1等等，如果你不知道要選擇哪種分佈，那就不能用卡方適合度檢定。\n\n紅花969株，白花360株，檢驗是否符合孟德爾3:1的分佈，用卡方適合度檢定\nchisq.test(c(969,360),p=c(0.75,0.25))\n#次數表放第一個變數,p後面接機率，機率合要等於1[R語法:chisq.test(次數表,p=機率)]\n\n骰子1000次，檢驗每面是否為1/6的分佈，用卡方適合度檢定\nx=ceiling(runif(1000)*6)#丟1000次骰子, ceiling是無條件進位，讓數值落在1~6的整數\ntable(x)\n#這是卡方檢定的重點，必須輸入統計次數，知道骰出1的有幾次，2的有幾次\nchisq.test(table(x),p=c(1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6))\n#次數表放第一個，p後面接分佈的機率，本次是6個1/6。\n\n[R語法:chisq.test(次數表,p=機率)]\n\n<h3>費雪精確性檢定 Fisher\'s exact test</h3>\n類似卡方檢定的小樣本方式，通常用於樣本小於20的狀況，案例是猜八杯茶是先加奶還是先加茶。\nfisher.test(table(real,guess))\n',
'<h2>變異數分析 ANOVA</h2>\n兩組資料連續看是否有差異，用t.test，兩組以上則用ANOVA，其虛無假說H0:u1=u2=u3=...un。\n若p值小於0.05，則認為並非所有的資料來自同一個母體。\n\n若要知道到底是哪組資料不同，可使用 \npairwise.t.test(Y, B, p.adjust.method="none")\n其中Y為資料列，B為組別列，並且不調整p值。\n雙因子變異數分析\naov(cardspent~factor(region)*factor(gender)\n使用*符號而不是+\n',
'<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>\nLogistic regression, also called a logit model, is used to model dichotomous outcome variables. \n\nLogistic regression is a method for fitting a regression curve, y = f(x), when y is a categorical variable. \nThe typical use of this model is predicting y given a set of predictors x. The predictors can be continuous, categorical or a mix of both.\n\n一般的線性迴歸都是連續數值，例如身高或體重。\n但有些情況下的應變數為類別，例如生還與否(1或0)，就可以採用Logistic Regression。\n\nLogistic Regression有幾項要點，\n1.他需要應變數為類別變項\n2.他會給出一個式子，帶入自變數後(可為連續變項或類別變項)，會得出一個值\n3.這個值稱為勝算比\n\n以鐵達尼號乘客名單的資料作為範例分析\nmodel1 = glm(data = titanic_passenger, family = binomial(link= formula = survival~fare, logit = "" na.action="na.exclude) &lt;\nsummary(model1)\n其中fare 對 survival 的對數機率為 0.013108\n勝算比為exp(0.013108)=1.013085\n多一英鎊，多1%生還率。\n參考資料\n<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rlearningsite/catagory/logit" target="_blank">Logistic迴歸模型</a>\n<a href="http://xn--r-vc8at2mlrkqvkh65cu2ccyjyqb/" target="_blank">R语言逻辑回归分析</a>\n<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-perform-a-logistic-regression-in-r/" target="_blank">How to perform a Logistic Regression in R</a><!---glm-->\n\n<a href="http://ccckmit.wikidot.com/r:optimize">一維空間優化方法：optimize()</a>\n<a href="http://ccckmit.wikidot.com/r:main">R 統計軟體 作者：陳鍾誠</a>\n<a href="http://programmermagazine.github.io/201309/htm/article3.html">R 統計軟體(6) – 迴歸分析</a>\n',

'<h2>Grouping functions (tapply, by, aggregate) and the *apply family</h2>\nR has many *apply functions.\nMuch of the functionality of the *apply family is covered by the extremely popular <code>plyr</code> package, the base functions remain useful and worth knowing.\n\n<k>apply</k> - <em>When you want to apply a function to the rows or columns of a matrix (and higher-dimensional analogues); not generally advisable for data frames as it will coerce to a matrix first.</em>\n\n<code># Two dimensional matrix\nM = matrix(seq(1,16), 4, 4)\n\n# apply min to rows\napply(M, 1, min)\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n# apply max to columns\napply(M, 2, max)\n[1]  4  8 12 16\n\n# 3 dimensional array\nM = array( seq(32), dim = c(4,4,2))\n\n# Apply sum across each M[*, , ] - i.e Sum across 2nd and 3rd dimension, look from top is an area\napply(M, 1, sum)\n# Result is one-dimensional\n[1] 120 128 136 144\n\n# Apply sum across each M[*, *, ] - i.e Sum across 3rd dimension\napply(M, c(1,2), sum)\n# Result is two-dimensional\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]   18   26   34   42\n[2,]   20   28   36   44\n[3,]   22   30   38   46\n[4,]   24   32   40   48\n</code>\n\nIf you want row/column means or sums for a 2D matrix, be sure to investigate the highly optimized, lightning-quick <code>colMeans</code>, <code>rowMeans</code>, <code>colSums</code>, <code>rowSums</code>.\n<k>lapply</k> - <em>When you want to apply a function to each element of a list in turn and get a list back.</em>\n\nThis is the workhorse of many of the other *apply functions. \nPeel back their code and you will often find <code>lapply</code> underneath.\n\n<code>x = list(a = 1, b = 1:3, c = 10:100) \nlapply(x, FUN = length) \n$a \n[1] 1\n$b \n[1] 3\n$c \n[1] 91\nlapply(x, FUN = sum) \n$a \n[1] 1\n$b \n[1] 6\n$c \n[1] 5005</code>\n<k>sapply</k> - <em>When you want to apply a function to each element of a list in turn, but you want a <k>vector</k> back, rather than a list.</em>\n\nIf you find yourself typing <code>unlist(lapply(...))</code>, stop and consider <code>sapply</code>.\n\n<code>x = list(a = 1, b = 1:3, c = 10:100)\n# Compare with above; a named vector, not a list \nsapply(x, FUN = length)  \na  b  c   \n1  3 91\n\nsapply(x, FUN = sum)   \na    b    c    \n1    6 5005 \n</code>\n\nIn more advanced uses of <code>sapply</code> it will attempt to coerce the result to a multi-dimensional array, if appropriate. \nFor example, if our function returns vectors of the same length, <code>sapply</code> will use them as columns of a matrix:\n\n<code>sapply(1:5,function(x) rnorm(3,x))\n</code>\n\nIf our function returns a 2 dimensional matrix, <code>sapply</code> will do essentially the same thing, treating each returned matrix as a single long vector:\n\n<code>sapply(1:5,function(x) matrix(x,2,2))</code>\n\nUnless we specify <code>simplify = "array"</code>, in which case it will use the individual matrices to build a multi-dimensional array:\n\n<code>sapply(1:5,function(x) matrix(x,2,2), simplify = "array")</code>\n\nEach of these behaviors is of course contingent on our function returning vectors or matrices of the same length or dimension.\n<k>vapply</k> - <em>When you want to use <code>sapply</code> but perhaps need to squeeze some more speed out of your code.</em>\n\nFor <code>vapply</code>, you basically give R an example of what sort of thing your function will return, which can save some time coercing returned values to fit in a single atomic vector.\n\n<code>x = list(a = 1, b = 1:3, c = 10:100)\n# Note that since the advantage here is mainly speed, this\n# example is only for illustration. \nWe\'re telling R that\n# everything returned by length() should be an integer of length 1. \n\nvapply(x, FUN = length, FUN.VALUE = 0L) \na  b  c  \n1  3 91\n</code>\n<k>mapply</k> - <em>For when you have several data structures (e.g. vectors, lists) and you want to apply a function to the 1st elements of each, and then the 2nd elements of each, etc., coercing the result to a vector/array as in <code>sapply</code>.</em>\n\nThis is multivariate in the sense that your function must accept multiple arguments.\n\n<code>#Sums the 1st elements, the 2nd elements, etc. \n\nmapply(sum, 1:5, 1:5, 1:5) \n[1]  3  6  9 12 15\n#To do rep(1,4), rep(2,3), etc.\nmapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)   \n[[1]]\n[1] 1 1 1 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2 2 2\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 4\n</code>\n<k>Map</k> - <em>A wrapper to <code>mapply</code> with <code>SIMPLIFY = FALSE</code>, so it is guaranteed to return a list.</em>\n\n<code>Map(sum, 1:5, 1:5, 1:5)\n[[1]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 6\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 9\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 12\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 15\n</code>\n<k>rapply</k> - <em>For when you want to apply a function to each element of a <k>nested list</k> structure, recursively.</em>\n\nTo give you some idea of how uncommon <code>rapply</code> is, I forgot about it when first posting this answer!

you are webscraping with Python chances are that you have already tried urllib, httplib, requests, etc. \nThese are excellent libraries, but some websites don’t like to be webscraped. \nIn these cases you may need to disguise your webscraping bot as a human being. \nSelenium is just the tool for that. \nSelenium is a webdriver: it takes control of your browser, which then does all the work. \nHence what the website “sees” is Chrome or Firefox or IE; it does not see Python or Selenium. \nThat makes it a lot harder for the website to tell your bot from a human being.\n\n<a

'<h2>4 Types of Classification Tasks in Machine Learning</h2>\nhttps://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/\n<h3>Tutorial Overview</h3>\nThis tutorial is divided into five parts; they are:\n\nClassification Predictive Modeling\nBinary Classification\nMulti-Class Classification\nMulti-Label Classification\nImbalanced Classification\n\n<h3>Classification Predictive Modeling</h3>\nThere are many different types of classification algorithms for modeling classification predictive modeling problems.\n\nThere is no good theory on how to map algorithms onto problem types; instead, it is generally recommended that a practitioner use controlled experiments and discover which algorithm and algorithm configuration results in the best performance for a given classification task.\n\nClassification predictive modeling algorithms are evaluated based on their results. Classification accuracy is a popular metric used to evaluate the performance of a model based on the predicted class labels. <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/failure-of-accuracy-for-imbalanced-class-distributions/">Classification accuracy is not perfect</a> but is a good starting point for many classification tasks.\n\nInstead of class labels, some tasks may require the prediction of a <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/probability-metrics-for-imbalanced-classification/">probability of class membership</a> for each example. This provides additional uncertainty in the prediction that an application or user can then interpret. A popular diagnostic for evaluating predicted probabilities is the <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/">ROC Curve</a>.\n\nThere are perhaps four main types of classification tasks that you may encounter; they are:\n\nBinary Classification\nMulti-Class Classification\nMulti-Label Classification\nImbalanced Classification\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at each in turn.\n\n<h3>Binary Classification</h3>\nThe class for the normal state is assigned the class label 0 and the class with the abnormal state is assigned the class label 1.\n\nIt is common to model a binary classification task with a model that predicts a <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/discrete-probability-distributions-for-machine-learning/">Bernoulli probability distribution</a> for each example.\n\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that covers a case where an event will have a binary outcome as either a 0 or 1. For classification, this means that the model predicts a probability of an example belonging to class 1, or the abnormal state.\n\nPopular algorithms that can be used for binary classification include:\n\nLogistic Regression\nk-Nearest Neighbors\nDecision Trees\nSupport Vector Machine\nNaive Bayes\n\nSome algorithms are specifically designed for binary classification and do not natively support more than two classes; examples include Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.\n\nNext, let\'s take a closer look at a dataset to develop an intuition for binary classification problems.\n\nWe can use the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_blobs.html">make_blobs() function</a> to generate a synthetic binary classification dataset.\n\nThe example below generates a dataset with 1,000 examples that belong to one of two classes, each with two input features.\n\n# example of binary classification task\nfrom numpy import where\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\n# define dataset\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=2, random_state=1)\n# summarize dataset shape\nprint(X.shape, y.shape)\n# summarize observations by class label\ncounter = Counter(y)\nprint(counter)\n# summarize first few examples\nfor i in range(10):\n	print(X[i], y[i])\n# plot the dataset and color the by class label\nfor label, _ in counter.items():\n	row_ix = where(y == label)[0]\n	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1], label=str(label))\npyplot.legend()\npyplot.show()\n\nRunning the example first summarizes the created dataset showing the 1,000 examples divided into input (<em>X</em>) and output (<em>y</em>) elements.\n\nThe distribution of the class labels is then summarized, showing that instances belong to either class 0 or class 1 and that there are 500 examples in each class.\n\nNext, the first 10 examples in the dataset are summarized, showing the input values are numeric and the target values are integers that represent the class membership.\n\n(1000, 2) (1000,)\n\nCounter({0: 500, 1: 500})\n\n[-3.05837272  4.48825769] 0\n[-8.60973869 -3.72714879] 1\n[1.37129721 5.23107449] 0\n[-9.33917563 -2.9544469 ] 1\n[-11.57178593  -3.85275513] 1\n[-11.42257341  -4.85679127] 1\n[-10.44518578  -3.76476563] 1\n[-10.44603561  -3.26065964] 1\n[-0.61947075  3.48804983] 0\n[-10.91115591  -4.5772537 ] 1\n\nFinally, a scatter plot is created for the input variables in the dataset and the points are colored based on their class value.\n\nWe can see two distinct clusters that we might expect would be easy to discriminate.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Scatter-Plot-of-Binary-Classification-Dataset.png">\nScatter Plot of Binary Classification Dataset\n\n<h3>Multi-Class Classification</h3>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification">Multi-class classification</a> refers to those classification tasks that have more than two class labels.\n\nExamples include:\n\nFace classification.\nPlant species classification.\nOptical character recognition.\n\nUnlike binary classification, multi-class classification does not have the notion of normal and abnormal outcomes. Instead, examples are classified as belonging to one among a range of known classes.\n\nThe number of class labels may be very large on some problems. For example, a model may predict a photo as belonging to one among thousands or tens of thousands of faces in a face recognition system.\n\nProblems that involve predicting a sequence of words, such as text translation models, may also be considered a special type of multi-class classification. Each word in the sequence of words to be predicted involves a multi-class classification where the size of the vocabulary defines the number of possible classes that may be predicted and could be tens or hundreds of thousands of words in size.\n\nIt is common to model a multi-class classification task with a model that predicts a <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/discrete-probability-distributions-for-machine-learning/">Multinoulli probability distribution</a> for each example.\n\nThe Multinoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that covers a case where an event will have a categorical outcome, e.g. <em>K</em> in {1, 2, 3, &#8230;, <em>K</em>}. For classification, this means that the model predicts the probability of an example belonging to each class label.\n\nMany algorithms used for binary classification can be used for multi-class classification.\n\nPopular algorithms that can be used for multi-class classification include:\n\nk-Nearest Neighbors.\nDecision Trees.\nNaive Bayes.\nRandom Forest.\nGradient Boosting.\n\nAlgorithms that are designed for binary classification can be adapted for use for multi-class problems.\n\nThis involves using a strategy of fitting multiple binary classification models for each class vs. all other classes (called one-vs-rest) or one model for each pair of classes (called one-vs-one).\n\n<k>One-vs-Rest</k>: Fit one binary classification model for each class vs. all other classes.\n<k>One-vs-One</k>: Fit one binary classification model for each pair of classes.\n\nBinary classification algorithms that can use these strategies for multi-class classification include:\n\nLogistic Regression.\nSupport Vector Machine.\n\nNext, let\'s take a closer look at a dataset to develop an intuition for multi-class classification problems.\n\nWe can use the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_blobs.html">make_blobs() function</a> to generate a synthetic multi-class classification dataset.\n\nThe example below generates a dataset with 1,000 examples that belong to one of three classes, each with two input features.\n\n# example of multi-class classification task\nfrom numpy import where\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\n# define dataset\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=3, random_state=1)\n# summarize dataset shape\nprint(X.shape, y.shape)\n# summarize observations by class label\ncounter = Counter(y)\nprint(counter)\n# summarize first few examples\nfor i in range(10):\n	print(X[i], y[i])\n# plot the dataset and color the by class label\nfor label, _ in counter.items():\n	row_ix = where(y == label)[0]\n	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1], label=str(label))\npyplot.legend()\npyplot.show()\n\nRunning the example first summarizes the created dataset showing the 1,000 examples divided into input (<em>X</em>) and output (<em>y</em>) elements.\n\nThe distribution of the class labels is then summarized, showing that instances belong to class 0, class 1, or class 2 and that there are approximately 333 examples in each class.\n\nNext, the first 10 examples in the dataset are summarized showing the input values are numeric and the target values are integers that represent the class membership.\n\n(1000, 2) (1000,)\n\nCounter({0: 334, 1: 333, 2: 333})\n\n[-3.05837272  4.48825769] 0\n[-8.60973869 -3.72714879] 1\n[1.37129721 5.23107449] 0\n[-9.33917563 -2.9544469 ] 1\n[-8.63895561 -8.05263469] 2\n[-8.48974309 -9.05667083] 2\n[-7.51235546 -7.96464519] 2\n[-7.51320529 -7.46053919] 2\n[-0.61947075  3.48804983] 0\n[-10.91115591  -4.5772537 ] 1\n\nFinally, a scatter plot is created for the input variables in the dataset and the points are colored based on their class value.\n\nWe can see three distinct clusters that we might expect would be easy to discriminate.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Scatter-Plot-of-Multi-Class-Classification-Dataset.png">\nScatter Plot of Multi-Class Classification Dataset\n\n<h3>Multi-Label Classification</h3>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification">Multi-label classification</a> refers to those classification tasks that have two or more class labels, where one or more class labels may be predicted for each example.\n\nConsider the example of <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/object-recognition-with-deep-learning/">photo classification</a>, where a given photo may have multiple objects in the scene and a model may predict the presence of multiple known objects in the photo, such as &#8220;<em>bicycle</em>,&#8221; &#8220;<em>apple</em>,&#8221; &#8220;<em>person</em>,&#8221; etc.\n\nThis is unlike binary classification and multi-class classification, where a single class label is predicted for each example.\n\nIt is common to model multi-label classification tasks with a model that predicts multiple outputs, with each output taking predicted as a Bernoulli probability distribution. This is essentially a model that makes multiple binary classification predictions for each example.\n\nClassification algorithms used for binary or multi-class classification cannot be used directly for multi-label classification. Specialized versions of standard classification algorithms can be used, so-called multi-label versions of the algorithms, including:\n\nMulti-label Decision Trees\nMulti-label Random Forests\nMulti-label Gradient Boosting\n\nAnother approach is to use a separate classification algorithm to predict the labels for each class.\n\nNext, let\'s take a closer look at a dataset to develop an intuition for multi-label classification problems.\n\nWe can use the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html">make_multilabel_classification() function</a> to generate a synthetic multi-label classification dataset.\n\nThe example below generates a dataset with 1,000 examples, each with two input features.

'<h2>When to use CPUs vs GPUs vs TPUs?</h2>\nBehind every machine learning algorithm is hardware crunching away at multiple gigahertz. \nYou may have noticed several processor options when setting up Kaggle notebooks, but which one is best for you? In this blog post, we compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of using CPUs (<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/xeon.html" target="_blank">Intel Xeon</a>*) vs GPUs (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/" target="_blank">Nvidia Tesla P100</a>) vs TPUs (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/" target="_blank">Google TPU v3</a>) for training machine learning models that were written using <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">tf.keras</a> (Figure 1**). \nWe’re hoping this will help you make sense of the options and select the right choice for your project.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1466/1*suXcuHEe29aKLPrQnXGBrg.png">\n\nHow we prepared the test\nIn order to compare the performance of CPUs vs GPUs vs TPUs for accomplishing common data science tasks, we used the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers" target="_blank">tf_flowers dataset</a> to train a convolutional neural network, and then the exact same code was run three times using the three different backends (CPUs vs GPUs vs TPUs; GPUs were NVIDIA P100 with Intel Xeon 2GHz (2 core) CPU and 13GB RAM. \nTPUs were TPUv3 (8 core) with Intel Xeon 2GHz (4 core) CPU and 16GB RAM). \nThe accompanying <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mgornergoogle/flowers-with-keras-and-xception-fine-tuned-on-gpu" target="_blank">tutorial notebook</a> demonstrates a few best practices for getting the best performance out of your TPU.\nFor example:\n\nUsing a dataset of sharded files (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/convert-kaggle-dataset-to-gcs-bucket-of-tfrecords" target="_blank">e.g., .TFRecord</a>)\nUsing the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data" target="_blank">tf.data</a> API to pass the training data to the TPU\nUsing large batch sizes (e.g. batch_size=128)\n\nBy adding these precursory steps to your workflow, it is possible to avoid a common I/O bottleneck that otherwise prevents the TPU from operating at its full potential. \nYou can find additional tips for optimizing your code to run on TPUs by visiting the official <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu" target="_blank">Kaggle TPU documentation</a>.\nHow the hardware performed\nThe most notable difference between the three hardware types that we tested was the speed that it took to train a model using <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">tf.keras</a>. \nThe tf.keras library is one of the most popular machine learning frameworks because tf.keras makes it easy to quickly experiment with new ideas. \nIf you spend less time writing code then you have more time to perform your calculations, and if you spend less time waiting for your code to run, then you have more time to evaluate new ideas (Figure 2). \ntf.keras and TPUs are a powerful combination when participating in <a href="https://kaggle.com/c/flower-classification-with-tpus" target="_blank">machine learning competitions</a>!\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1438/1*bqmG-YzgJzVeLbQ5Ym1iFg.png">\nFor our first experiment, we used the same code (a modified version*** of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mgornergoogle/flowers-with-keras-and-xception-fine-tuned-on-gpu" target="_blank">official tutorial notebook</a>) for all three hardware types, which required using a very small batch size of 16 in order to avoid out-of-memory errors from the CPU and GPU. \nUnder these conditions, we observed that TPUs were responsible for a ~100x speedup as compared to CPUs and a ~3.5x speedup as compared to GPUs when training an <a href="https://keras.io/applications/#xception" target="_blank">Xception</a> model (Figure 3). \nBecause TPUs operate more efficiently with large batch sizes, we also tried increasing the batch size to 128 and this resulted in an additional ~2x speedup for TPUs and out-of-memory errors for GPUs and CPUs. \nUnder these conditions, the TPU was able to train an <a href="https://keras.io/applications/#xception" target="_blank">Xception</a> model more than 7x as fast as the GPU from the previous experiment****.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1438/1*p2X9DQcq9K5Iu76Kk82vrg.png">\nThe observed speedups for model training varied according to the type of model, with Xception and Vgg16 performing better than ResNet50 (Figure 4). Model training was the only type of task where we observed the TPU to outperform the GPU by such a large margin. \nFor example, we observed that in our hands the TPUs were ~3x faster than CPUs and ~3x slower than GPUs for performing a small number of predictions (TPUs perform exceptionally when making predictions in some situations such as when <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O49AkNyYV48n0X4nWr7KE-5aask88pz9gBSQ26ZG-5o/edit#slide=id.g50ce3d3866_0_1590" target="_blank">making predictions</a> on very large batches, which were not present in this experiment).\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/46/1*p7U2zlYn9O5Yvjluh2P-dg.png">\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1466/1*p7U2zlYn9O5Yvjluh2P-dg.png">\nTo supplement these results, we note that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10701" target="_blank">Wang<em> et. \nal</em></a> have developed a rigorous benchmark called ParaDnn [1] that can be used to compare the performance of different hardware types for training machine learning models. \nBy using this method Wang<em> et. \nal</em> were able to conclude that the performance benefit for parameterized models ranged from 1x to 10x, and the performance benefit for real models ranged from 3x to 6.8x when a TPU was used instead of a GPU (Figure 5). \nTPUs perform best when combined with sharded datasets, large batch sizes, and large models.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1466/1*QbP2CPDZH5BQWlnaTtW3oA.png">\nPrice considerations when training models\nWhile our comparisons treated the hardware equally, there is a sizeable difference in pricing. TPUs are ~5x as expensive as GPUs (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/gpus-pricing" target="_blank">$1.46/hr</a> for a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/" target="_blank">Nvidia Tesla P100</a> GPU vs <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing" target="_blank">$8.00/hr</a> for a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/" target="_blank">Google TPU v3</a> vs <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing" target="_blank">$4.50/hr</a> for the TPUv2 with “on-demand” access on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pricing/" target="_blank">GCP</a> ). \nIf you are trying to optimize for cost then it makes sense to use a TPU if it will train your model at least 5 times as fast as if you trained the same model using a GPU.\nWe consistently observed model training speedups on the order of ~5x when the data was stored in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/convert-kaggle-dataset-to-gcs-bucket-of-tfrecords" target="_blank">a sharded format</a> in a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-move-data-from-kaggle-to-gcs-and-back" target="_blank">GCS bucket</a> then passed to the TPU in large batch sizes, and therefore we recommend TPUs to cost-conscious consumers that are familiar with the <a href="http://tf.data" target="_blank">tf.data</a> API.\nSome machine learning practitioners prioritize the reduction of model training time as opposed to prioritizing the reduction of model training costs. \nFor someone that just wants to train their model as fast as possible, the TPU is the best choice. \nIf you spend less time training your model, then you have more time to iterate upon new ideas. \nBut don’t take our word for it — you can evaluate the performance benefits of CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs by running your own code in a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels#the-kernels-environment" target="_blank">Kaggle Notebook</a>, free-of-charge. \nKaggle users are already having a lot of fun and success experimenting with TPUs and text data: check out <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering/discussion/127333" target="_blank">this forum post</a> that describes how TPUs were used to train a BERT transformer model to win $8,000 (2nd prize) in a recent <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering" target="_blank">Kaggle competition</a>.\nWhich hardware option should you choose?\nIn summary, we recommend CPUs for their versatility and for their large memory capacity. \nGPUs are a great alternative to CPUs when you want to speed up a variety of data science workflows, and TPUs are best when you specifically want to train a machine learning model as fast as you possibly can.\nYou can get better results by optimizing your code for the specific hardware that you are using and we think it would be especially interesting to compare runtimes for code that has been optimized for a GPU to runtimes for code that has been optimized for a TPU. \nFor example, it would be interesting to record the time that it takes to train a gradient-boosted model using a GPU-accelerated library such as <a href="https://rapids.ai/" target="_blank">RAPIDS.ai</a> and then to compare that to the time that it takes to train a deep learning model using a TPU-accelerated library such as <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">tf.keras</a>.\nWhat is the least amount of time that one can train an accurate machine learning model? How many different ideas can you evaluate in a single day? When used in combination with tf.keras, TPUs allow machine learning practitioners to spend less time writing code and less time waiting for their code to run — leaving more time to evaluate new ideas and improve one’s performance in <a href="http://kaggle.com/c/flower-classification-with-tpus" target="_blank">Kaggle Competitions</a>.\n\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>* CPU types vary according to variability. \nIn addition to the Intel Xeon CPUs, you can also get assigned to either Intel Skylake, Intel Broadwell, or Intel Haswell CPUs. \nGPUs were NVIDIA P100 with Intel Xeon 2GHz (2 core) CPU and 13GB RAM. \nTPUs were TPUv3 (8 core) with Intel Xeon 2GHz (4 core) CPU and 16GB RAM).\n** Image for Figure 1 from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-breaks-scalability-records-for-ai-inference" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-breaks-scalability-records-for-ai-inference,</a> with permission.\n*** The tutorial notebook was modified to keep the parameters (e.g. batch_size, learning_rate, etc) consistent between the three different backends.\n**** CPU and GPU experiments used a batch size of 16 because it allowed the Kaggle notebooks to run from top to bottom without memory errors or 9-hr timeout errors. \nOnly TPU-enabled notebooks were able to run successfully when the batch size was increased to 128.\n',

'<h2>An Introduction to XPath: How to Get Started</h2>\n\nXPath is a powerful language that is often used for scraping the web. \nIt allows you to select nodes or compute values from an XML or HTML document and is actually one of the languages that you can use to extract web data using Scrapy. \nThe other is CSS and while CSS selectors are a popular choice, XPath can actually allow you to do more.\n\nWith XPath, you can extract data based on text elements\' contents, and not only on the page structure. \nSo when you are scraping the web and you run into a hard-to-scrape website, XPath may just save the day (and a bunch of your time!).\n\nThis is an introductory tutorial that will walk you through the basic concepts of XPath, crucial to a good understanding of it, before diving into more complex use cases.\n<h3>The basics</h3>\nConsider this HTML document:\n\n<code>&lt;html>\n  &lt;head>\n    &lt;title>My page&lt;/title>\n  &lt;/head>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;h2>Welcome to my &lt;a href="#">page&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>\n    &lt;p>This is the first paragraph.&lt;/p>\n    &lt;!-- this is the end -->\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></code>\n\nXPath handles any XML/HTML document as a tree. \nThis tree\'s root node is not part of the document itself. \nIt is in fact the parent of the document element node (<code>&lt;html></code> in case of the HTML above). \nThis is how the XPath tree for the HTML document looks like:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://blog.scrapinghub.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tree-7.png" style="background-color: gray">\n\nAs you can see, there are many node types in an XPath tree:\n\n<k>Element node:</k> represents an HTML element, a.k.a an HTML tag.\n<k>Attribute node:</k> represents an attribute from an element node, e.g. “href” attribute in <code>&lt;a href=”http://www.example.com”>example&lt;/a></code>.\n<k>Comment node:</k> represents comments in the document (<code>&lt;!-- … --></code>).\n<k>Text node:</k> represents the text enclosed in an element node (<code>example</code> in <code>&lt;p>example&lt;/p></code>).\n\nDistinguishing between these different types is useful to understand how XPath expressions work. \nNow let\'s start digging into XPath.\n\nHere is how we can select the title element from the page above using an XPath expression:\n\n/html/head/title\n\nThis is what we call a location path. \nIt allows us to specify the path from the <k>context node</k> (in this case the root of the tree) to the element we want to select, as we do when addressing files in a file system. \nThe location path above has three location steps, separated by slashes. \nIt roughly means: <em>start from the ‘html’ element, look for a ‘head’ element underneath, and a ‘title’ element underneath that ‘head’</em>. \nThe context node changes in each step. \nFor example, the <code>head</code> node is the context node when the last step is being evaluated.\n\nHowever, we usually don\'t know or don’t care about the full explicit node-by-node path, we just care about the nodes with a given name. \nWe can select them using:\n\n//title\n\nWhich means:<em> look in the whole tree, starting from the root of the tree (<code>//</code>) and select only those nodes whose name matches <code>title</code></em>. \nIn this example, <code>//</code> is the <k>axis</k> and <code>title</code> is the <k>node test</k>.\n\nIn fact, the expressions we\'ve just seen are using XPath\'s abbreviated syntax. \nTranslating <code>//title</code> to the full syntax we get:\n\n/descendant-or-self::node()/child::title\n\nSo, <code>//</code> in the abbreviated syntax is short for <code>descendant-or-self</code>, which means <em>the current node or any node below it in the tree</em>. \nThis part of the expression is called the <k>axis</k> and it specifies a set of nodes to select from, based on their direction on the tree from the current context (downwards, upwards, on the same tree level). \nOther examples of axes are: parent, child, ancestor, etc -- we’ll dig more into this later on.\n\nThe next part of the expression, <code>node()</code>, is called a <k>node test</k>, and it contains an expression that is evaluated to decide whether a given node should be selected or not. \nIn this case, it selects nodes from all types. \nThen we have another axis,<code>child</code>, which means <em>go to the child nodes from the current context</em>, followed by another node test, which selects the nodes named as <code>title</code>.\n\n<blockquote>\nSo, the <k>axis</k> defines where in the tree the <k>node test</k> should be applied and the nodes that match the node test will be returned as a <k>result</k>.\n\n</blockquote>\nYou can test nodes against their name or against their type.\n\nHere are some examples of name tests:\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Expression</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>/html</td>\n<td>Selects the node named <code>html</code>, which is under the root.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>/html/head</td>\n<td>Selects the node named <code>head</code>, which is under the <code>html</code> node.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//title</td>\n<td>Selects all the <code>title</code> nodes from the HTML tree.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//h2/a</td>\n<td>Selects all <code>a</code> nodes which are directly under an <code>h2</code> node.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nAnd here are some examples of node type tests:\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Expression</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//comment()</td>\n<td>Selects only comment nodes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//node()</td>\n<td>Selects any kind of node in the tree.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//text()</td>\n<td>Selects only text nodes, such as "This is the first paragraph".</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//*</td>\n<td>Selects all nodes, except comment and text nodes.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nWe can also combine name and node tests in the same expression. \nFor example:\n\n//p/text()\n\nThis expression selects the text nodes from inside <code>p</code> elements. \nIn the HTML snippet shown above, it would select "This is the first paragraph.".\n\nNow, <k>let’s see how we can further filter and specify things</k>. \nConsider this HTML document:\n\n<code>&lt;html>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;ul>\n      &lt;li>Quote 1&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li>Quote 2 with &lt;a href="...">link&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li>Quote 3 with &lt;a href="...">another link&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li>&lt;h2>Quote 4 title&lt;/h2> ...&lt;/li>\n    &lt;/ul>\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></code>\n\nSay we want to select only the first <code>li</code> node from the snippet above. \nWe can do this with:\n\n//li[position() = 1]\n\nThe expression surrounded by square brackets is called a predicate and it filters the node set returned by <code>//li</code> (that is, all <code>li</code> nodes from the document) using the given condition. \nIn this case it checks each node\'s position using the <code>position()</code> function, which returns the position of the current node in the resulting node set (notice that positions in XPath start at 1, not 0). \nWe can abbreviate the expression above to:\n\n//li[1]\n\nBoth XPath expressions above would select the following element:\n\n    &lt;li class="quote">Quote 1&lt;/li>\n\nCheck out a few more predicate examples:\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Expression</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//li[position()%2=0]</td>\n<td>Selects the <code>li</code> elements at even positions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//li[a]</td>\n<td>Selects the <code>li</code> elements which enclose an <code>a</code> element.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//li[a or h2]</td>\n<td>Selects the <code>li</code> elements which enclose either an <code>a</code> or an <code>h2</code> element.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//li[ a [ text() = "link" ] ]</td>\n<td>Selects the <code>li</code> elements which enclose an <code>a</code> element whose text is "link". \nCan also be written as <code>//li[ a/text()="link" ]</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//li[last()]</td>\n<td>Selects the last <code>li</code> element in the document.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nSo, a location path is basically composed by steps, which are separated by <code>/</code> and each step can have an axis, a node test and a predicate. \nHere we have an expression composed by two steps, each one with axis, node test and predicate:\n\n&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;">//li[ 4 ]/h2[ text() = "Quote 4 title" ]&lt;/span>\n\nAnd here is the same expression, written using the non-abbreviated syntax:\n\n/descendant-or-self::node()\n\n    /child::li[ position() = 4 ]\n\n        /child::h2[ text() = "Quote 4 title" ]\n\nWe can also <k>combine</k> multiple XPath expressions in a single one using the union operator <code>|</code>. \nFor example, we can select all <code>a</code> and <code>h2</code> elements in the document above using this expression:\n\n//a | //h2\n\nNow, consider this HTML document:\n\n<code>&lt;html>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;ul>\n      &lt;li id="begin">&lt;a href="https://scrapy.org">Scrapy&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://scrapinghub.com">Scrapinghub&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.scrapinghub.com">Scrapinghub Blog&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li id="end">&lt;a href="http://quotes.toscrape.com">Quotes To Scrape&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n    &lt;/ul>\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></code>\n\nSay we want to select only the <code>a</code> elements whose link points to an HTTPS URL. \nWe can do it by checking their <code>href</code> <k>attribute</k>:\n\n//a[starts-with(@href, "https")]\n\nThis expression first selects all the <code>a</code> elements from the document and for each of those elements, it checks whether their <code>href</code> attribute starts with "https". \nWe can access any node attribute using the <code>@attributename</code> syntax.\n\nHere we have a few additional examples using attributes:\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Expression</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//a[@href="https://scrapy.org"]</td>\n<td>Selects the <code>a</code> elements pointing to https://scrapy.org.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//a/@href</td>\n<td>Selects the value of the <code>href</code> attribute from all the <code>a</code> elements in the document.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>//li[@id]</td>\n<td>Selects only the <code>li</code> elements which have an <code>id</code> attribute.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>More on Axes</h3>\nWe\'ve seen only two types of axes so far:\n\ndescendant-or-self\nchild\n\nBut there\'s plenty more where they came from and we\'ll see a few examples. \nConsider this HTML document:\n\n<code>&lt;html>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;p>Intro paragraph&lt;/p>\n    &lt;h1>Title #1&lt;/h1>\n    &lt;p>A random paragraph #1&lt;/p>\n    &lt;h1>Title #2&lt;/h1>\n    &lt;p>A random paragraph #2&lt;/p>\n    &lt;p>Another one #2&lt;/p>\n    A single paragraph, with no markup\n    &lt;div id="footer">&lt;p>Footer text&lt;/p>&lt;/div>\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></code>\n\nNow we want to extract only the first paragraph after each of the titles. \nTo do that, we can use the <code>following-sibling</code> axis, which selects all the siblings after the context node. \nSiblings are nodes who are children of the same parent, for example all children nodes of the <code>body</code> tag are siblings. \nThis is the expression:\n\n//h1/following-sibling::p[1]\n\nIn this example, the context node where the <code>following-sibling</code> axis is applied to is each of the <code>h1</code> nodes from the page.\n\nWhat if we want to select only the text that is right before the <code>footer</code>? We can use the <code>preceding-sibling</code> axis:\n\n//div[@id=\'footer\']/preceding-sibling::text()[1]\n\nIn this case, we are selecting the first text node before the <code>div</code> footer (<em>"A single paragraph, with no markup"</em>).\n\nXPath also allows us to select elements based on their text content. \nWe can use such a feature, along with the <code>parent</code> axis, to select the parent of the <code>p</code> element whose text is "Footer text":\n\n//p[ text()="Footer text" ]/..\n\nThe expression above selects <code>&lt;div id="footer">&lt;p>Footer text&lt;/p>&lt;/div></code>. \nAs you may have noticed, we used <code>..</code> here as a shortcut to the <code>parent</code> axis.\n\nAs an alternative to the expression above, we could use:\n\n//*[p/text()="Footer text"]\n\nIt selects, from all elements, the ones that have a <code>p</code> child which text is "Footer text", getting the same result as the previous expression.\n\nYou can find additional axes in the XPath specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#axes\n\n<h3>Wrap up</h3>\nXPath is very powerful and this post is just an introduction to the basic concepts. \nIf you want to learn more about it, check out these resources:\n\nhttp://zvon.org/comp/r/tut-XPath_1.html\nhttp://fr.slideshare.net/scrapinghub/xpath-for-web-scraping\nhttps://blog.scrapinghub.com/2014/07/17/xpath-tips-from-the-web-scraping-trenches/\n\nAnd <k>stay tuned</k>, because we will post a series with more XPath tips from the trenches in the following months.\n',

'<h2>自然语言处理中的Transformer和BERT</h2>\n2018年马上就要过去，回顾深度学习在今年的进展，让人印象最深刻的就是谷歌提出的应用于自然语言处理领域的BERT解决方案，BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding（<a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805</a>）。\nBERT解决方案刷新了各大NLP任务的榜单，在各种NLP任务上都做到state of the art。\n这里我把BERT说成是解决方案，而不是一个算法，因为这篇文章并没有提出新的算法模型，还是沿用了之前已有的算法模型。\nBERT最大的创新点，在于提出了一套完整的方案，利用之前最新的算法模型，去解决各种各样的NLP任务，因此BERT这篇论文对于算法模型完全不做介绍，以至于在我直接看这篇文章的时候感觉云里雾里。\n但是本文中，我会从算法模型到解决方案，进行完整的诠释。\n本文中我会分3个部分进行介绍，第一部分我会大概介绍一下NLP的发展，第二部分主要讲BERT用到的算法，最后一部分讲BERT具体是怎么操作的。\n\n<h3>一，NLP的发展</h3>\n要处理NLP问题，首先要解决文本的表示问题。\n虽然我们人去看文本，能够清楚明白文本中的符号表达什么含义，但是计算机只能做数学计算，需要将文本表示成计算机可以处理的形式。\n最开始的方法是采用one hot，比如，我们假设英文中常用的单词有3万个，那么我们就用一个3万维的向量表示这个词，所有位置都置0，当我们想表示apple这个词时，就在对应位置设置1，如图1.1所示。\n这种表示方式存在的问题就是，高维稀疏，高维是指有多少个词，就需要多少个维度的向量，稀疏是指，每个向量中大部分值都是0。\n另外一个不足是这个向量没有任何含义。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-597b011ddd148eb53b5a90730b6090ae_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图1.1</figcaption>\n后来出现了词向量，word embedding，用一个低维稠密的向量去表示一个词，如图1.2所示。\n通常这个向量的维度在几百到上千之间，相比one hot几千几万的维度就低了很多。\n词与词之间可以通过相似度或者距离来表示关系，相关的词向量相似度比较高，或者距离比较近，不相关的词向量相似度低，或者距离比较远，这样词向量本身就有了含义。\n文本的表示问题就得到了解决。\n词向量可以通过一些无监督的方法学习得到，比如CBOW或者Skip-Gram等，可以预先在语料库上训练出词向量，以供后续的使用。\n顺便提一句，在图像中就不存在表示方法的困扰，因为图像本身就是数值矩阵，计算机可以直接处理。\n\n<img class="lazy"

class="lazy" data-src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-4546b7aa51af50d3ac0c7504f965cc70_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图1.3</figcaption>\n我们看一下图像领域是如何解决这个问题的。\n图像分类是计算机视觉中最基本的任务，当我要解决一个小数据集的图像分类任务时，该怎么做？CV领域已经有了一套成熟的解决方案。\n我会用一个通用的网络模型，比如Vgg，ResNet或者GoogleNet，在ImageNet上做预训练（pre-training）。\nImageNet有1400万张有标注的图片，包含1000个类别，这样的数据规模足以训练出一个规模庞大的模型。\n在训练过程中，模型会不断的学习如何提取特征，底层的CNN网络结构会提取边缘，角，点等通用特征，模型越往上走，提取的特征也越抽象，与特定的任务更加相关。\n当完成预训练之后，根据我自己的分类任务，调整最上层的网络结构，然后在小数据集里对模型进行训练。\n在训练时，可以固定住底层的模型参数只训练顶层的参数，也可以对整个模型进行训练，这个过程叫做微调（fine-tuning），最终得到一个可用的模型。\n总结一下，整个过程包括两步，拿一个通用模型在ImageNet上做预训练（pre-training），然后针对特定任务进行微调（fine-tuning），完美解决了特定任务数据不足的问题。\n还有一个好处是，对于各种各样的任务都不再需要从头开始训练网络，可以直接拿预训练好的结果进行微调，既减少了训练计算量的负担，也减少了人工标注数据的负担。\n\nNLP领域也引入了这种做法，用一个通用模型，在非常大的语料库上进行预训练，然后在特定任务上进行微调，BERT就是这套方案的集大成者。\nBERT不是第一个，但目前为止，是效果最好的方案。\nBERT用了一个已有的模型结构，提出了一整套的预训练方法和微调方法，我们在后文中再进行详细的描述。\n\n<h3>二，算法</h3>\nBERT所采用的算法来自于2017年12月份的这篇文章，Attenion Is All You Need（<a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762</a>），同样来自于谷歌。\n这篇文章要解决的是翻译问题，比如从中文翻译成英文。\n这篇文章完全放弃了以往经常采用的RNN和CNN，提出了一种新的网络结构，即Transformer，其中包括encoder和decoder，我们只关注encoder。\n这篇英文博客（<a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">\nhttps://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/</a>）对Transformer介绍得非常详细，有兴趣的读者可以看一下，如果不想看英文博客也可以看本文，本文中的部分图片也截取自这篇博客。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-393d5284f5132c3150b294cfc5e5218f_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.1</figcaption>\n图2.1是Transformer encoder的结构，后文中我们都简称为Transformer。\n首先是输入word embedding，这里是直接输入一整句话的所有embedding。\n如图2.1所示，假设我们的输入是Thinking Machines，每个词对应一个embedding，就有2个embedding。\n输入embedding需要加上位置编码（Positional Encoding），为什么要加位置编码，后文会做详细介绍。\n然后经过一个Multi-Head Attention结构，这个结构是算法单元中最重要的部分，我们会在后边详细介绍。\n之后是做了一个shortcut的处理，就是把输入和输出按照对应位置加起来，如果了解残差网络（ResNet）的同学，会对这个结构比较熟悉，这个操作有利于加速训练。\n然后经过一个归一化normalization的操作。\n接着经过一个两层的全连接网络，最后同样是shortcut和normalization的操作。\n可以看到，除了Multi-Head Attention，都是常规操作，没有什么难理解的。\n这里需要注意的是，每个小模块的输入和输出向量，维度都是相等的，比如，Multi-Head Attention的输入和输出向量维度是相等的，否则无法进行shortcut的操作；Feed Forward的输入和输出向量维度也是相等的；最终的输出和输入向量维度也是相等的。\n但是Multi-Head Attention和Feed Forward内部，向量维度会发生变化。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-4019f1ffead184e3bc00aabb41e6b6b6_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.2</figcaption>\n我们来详细看一下Multi-Head Attention的结构。\n这个Multi-Head表示多头的意思，先从最简单的看起，看看单头Attention是如何操作的。\n从图2.1的橙色方块可以看到，embedding在进入到Attention之前，有3个分叉，那表示说从1个向量，变成了3个向量。\n具体是怎么算的呢？我们看图2.3，定义一个WQ矩阵（这个矩阵随机初始化，通过训练得到），将embedding和WQ矩阵做乘法，得到查询向量q，假设输入embedding是512维，在图3中我们用4个小方格表示，输出的查询向量是64维，图3中用3个小方格以示不同。\n然后类似地，定义WK和WV矩阵，将embedding和WK做矩阵乘法，得到键向量k；将embeding和WV做矩阵乘法，得到值向量v。\n对每一个embedding做同样的操作，那么每个输入就得到了3个向量，查询向量，键向量和值向量。\n需要注意的是，查询向量和键向量要有相同的维度，值向量的维度可以相同，也可以不同，但一般也是相同的。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-ac045486e0eff3b8a1eb27d2ae61a634_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.3</figcaption>\n接下来我们计算每一个embedding的输出，以第一个词Thinking为例，参看图2.4。\n用查询向量q1跟键向量k1和k2分别做点积，得到112和96两个数值。\n这也是为什么前文提到查询向量和键向量的维度必须要一致，否则无法做点积。\n然后除以常数8，得到14和12两个数值。\n这个常数8是键向量的维度的开方，键向量和查询向量的维度都是64，开方后是8。\n做这个尺度上的调整目的是为了易于训练。\n然后把14和12丢到softmax函数中，得到一组加和为1的系数权重，算出来是大约是0.88和0.12。\n将0.88和0.12对两个值向量v1和v2做加权求和，就得到了Thinking的输出向量z1。\n类似的，可以算出Machines的输出z2。\n如果一句话中包含更多的词，也是相同的计算方法。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-b25bb6a8f9b57a4831b485015080b8c1_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.4</figcaption>\n通过这样一系列的计算，可以看到，现在每个词的输出向量z都包含了其他词的信息，每个词都不再是孤立的了。\n而且每个位置中，词与词的相关程度，可以通过softmax输出的权重进行分析。\n如图2.5所示，这是某一次计算的权重，其中线条颜色的深浅反映了权重的大小，可以看到it中权重最大的两个词是The和animal，表示it跟这两个词关联最大。\n这就是attention的含义，输出跟哪个词关联比较强，就放比较多的注意力在上面。\n上面我们把每一步计算都拆开了看，实际计算的时候，可以通过矩阵来计算，如图2.6所示。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-2dbdd8dfb5088d22c7dd9d05a0e1035d_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.5</figcaption>\n\n<img class="lazy"

class="lazy" data-src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-2afc28e06f5550d5e20a2dc290f2224e_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.7</figcaption>\n到这里就把Transformer的结构讲完了，同样都是做NLP任务，我们来和RNN做个对比。\n图2.8是个最基本的RNN结构，还有计算公式。\n当计算隐向量h4时，用到了输入x4，和上一步算出来的隐向量h3，h3包含了前面所有节点的信息。\nh4中包含最多的信息是当前的输入x4，越往前的输入，随着距离的增加，信息衰减得越多。\n对于每一个输出隐向量h都是如此，包含信息最多得是当前的输入，随着距离拉远，包含前面输入的信息越来越少。\n但是Transformer这个结构就不存在这个问题，不管当前词和其他词的空间距离有多远，包含其他词的信息不取决于距离，而是取决于两者的相关性，这是Transformer的第一个优势。\n第二个优势在于，对于Transformer来说，在对当前词进行计算的时候，不仅可以用到前面的词，也可以用到后面的词。\n而RNN只能用到前面的词，这并不是个严重的问题，因为这可以通过双向RNN来解决。\n第三点，RNN是一个顺序的结构，必须要一步一步地计算，只有计算出h1，才能计算h2，再计算h3，隐向量无法同时并行计算，导致RNN的计算效率不高，这是RNN的固有结构所造成的，之前有一些工作就是在研究如何对RNN的计算并行化。\n通过前文的介绍，可以看到Transformer不存在这个问题。\n通过这里的比较，可以看到Transformer相对于RNN有巨大的优势，因此我看到有人说RNN以后会被取代。\n\n<img

Encoding）。\n位置编码是和word embedding同样维度的向量，将位置embedding和词embedding加在一起，作为输入embedding，如图2.9所示。\n位置编码可以通过学习得到，也可以通过设置一个跟位置或者时序相关的函数得到，比如设置一个正弦或者余弦函数，这里不再多说。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-df4b9de6b9feb1971ab7225ebc4454d2_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.9</figcaption>\n我们把图2.1的结构作为一个基本单元，把N个这样的基本单元顺序连起来，就是BERT的算法模型，如图2.10所示。\n从前面的描述中可以看到，当输入有多少个embedding，那么输出也就有相同数量的embedding，可以采用和RNN采用相同的叫法，把输出叫做隐向量。\n在做具体NLP任务的时候，只需要从中取对应的隐向量作为输出即可。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-81e63e36210c8e342d193be69c441e7c_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图2.10</figcaption>\n<h3>三，BERT</h3>\n在介绍BERT之前，我们先看看另外一套方案。\n我在第一部分说过，BERT并不是第一个提出预训练加微调的方案，此前还有一套方案叫GPT，这也是BERT重点对比的方案，文章在这，Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training（<a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf">\nhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf</a>）。\nGPT的模型结构和BERT是相同的，都是图2.10的结构，只是BERT的模型规模更加庞大。\nGPT是这么预训练的，在一个8亿单词的语料库上做训练，给出前文，不断地预测下一个单词。\n比如这句话，Winter is coming，当给出第一个词Winter之后，预测下一个词is，之后再预测下一个词coming。\n不需要标注数据，通过这种无监督训练的方式，得到一个预训练模型。\n\n我们再来看看BERT有什么不同。\nBERT来自于Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers首字母缩写，这里提到了一个双向（Bidirectional）的概念。\nBERT在一个33亿单词的语料库上做预训练，语料库就要比GPT大了几倍。\n预训练包括了两个任务，第一个任务是随机地扣掉15%的单词，用一个掩码MASK代替，让模型去猜测这个单词；第二个任务是，每个训练样本是一个上下句，有50%的样本，下句和上句是真实的，另外50%的样本，下句和上句是无关的，模型需要判断两句的关系。\n这两个任务各有一个loss，将这两个loss加起来作为总的loss进行优化。\n下面两行是一个小栗子，用括号标注的是扣掉的词，用[MASK]来代替。\n\n<b>正样本：我[MASK]（是）个算法工程师，我服务于WiFi万能钥匙这家[MASK]（公司）。\n</b>\n<b>负样本：我[MASK]（是）个算法工程师，今天[MASK]（股票）又跌了。\n</b>\n我们来对比下GPT和BERT两种预训练方式的优劣。\nGPT在预测词的时候，只预测下一个词，因此只能用到上文的信息，无法利用到下文的信息。\n而BERT是预测文中扣掉的词，可以充分利用到上下文的信息，这使得模型有更强的表达能力，这也是BERT中Bidirectional的含义。\n在一些NLP任务中需要判断句子关系，比如判断两句话是否有相同的含义。\nBERT有了第二个任务，就能够很好的捕捉句子之间的关系。\n图3.1是BERT原文中对另外两种方法的预训练对比，包括GPT和ELMo。\nELMo采用的还是LSTM，这里我们不多讲ELMo。\n这里会有读者困惑，这里的结构图怎么跟图2.10不一样？如果熟悉LSTM的同学，看到最右边的ELMo，就会知道那些水平相连的LSTM其实只是一个LSTM单元。\n左边的BERT和GPT也是一样，水平方向的Trm表示的是同一个单元，图中那些复杂的连线表示的是词与词之间的依赖关系，BERT中的依赖关系既有前文又有后文，而GPT的依赖关系只有前文。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-287ba1129d213df7e2ed5adb7c4a440e_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图3.1</figcaption>\n讲完了这两个任务，我们再来看看，如何表达这么复杂的一个训练样本，让计算机能够明白。\n图3.2表示“my dog is cute, he likes playing.”的输入形式。\n每个符号的输入由3部分构成，一个是词本身的embedding；第二个是表示上下句的embedding，如果是上句，就用A embedding，如果是下句，就用B embedding；最后，根据Transformer模型的特点，还要加上位置embedding，这里的位置embedding是通过学习的方式得到的，BERT设计一个样本最多支持512个位置；将3个embedding相加，作为输入。\n需要注意的是，在每个句子的开头，需要加一个Classification（CLS）符号，后文中会进行介绍，其他的一些小细节就不说了。\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-ec06762a57a7d7176747627dc3ee20b4_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图3.2</figcaption>\n完成预训练之后，就要针对特定任务就行微调了，这里描述一下论文中的4个例子，看图3.4。\n首先说下分类任务，分类任务包括对单句子的分类任务，比如判断电影评论是喜欢还是讨厌；多句子分类，比如判断两句话是否表示相同的含义。\n图3.4（a）（b）是对这类任务的一个示例，左边表示两个句子的分类，右边是单句子分类。\n在输出的隐向量中，取出CLS对应的向量C，加一层网络W，并丢给softmax进行分类，得到预测结果P，计算过程如图3.3中的计算公式。\n在特定任务数据集中对Transformer模型的所有参数和网络W共同训练，直到收敛。\n新增加的网络W是HxK维，H表示隐向量的维度，K表示分类数量，W的参数数量相比预训练模型的参数少得可怜。\n\n<img

data-src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-42514100ab16b207d2732729c85fccaa_b.jpg">\n\n<figcaption>图3.4</figcaption>\n我们再来看问答任务，如图3.4（c），以SQuAD v1.1为例，给出一个问题Question，并且给出一个段落Paragraph，然后从段落中标出答案的具体位置。\n需要学习一个开始向量S，维度和输出隐向量维度相同，然后和所有的隐向量做点积，取值最大的词作为开始位置；另外再学一个结束向量E，做同样的运算，得到结束位置。\n附加一个条件，结束位置一定要大于开始位置。\n最后再看NER任务，实体命名识别，比如给出一句话，对每个词进行标注，判断属于人名，地名，机构名，还是其他。\n如图3.4（d）所示，加一层分类网络，对每个输出隐向量都做一次判断。\n可以看到，这些任务，都只需要新增少量的参数，然后在特定数据集上进行训练即可。\n从实验结果来看，即便是很小的数据集，也能取得不错的效果。\n',

'<h2>R Linear Algebra</h2>\nR is especially handy with linear algebra. \nIts built-in data types like vectors and matrices mesh well with built-in functions like eigenvalue and determinant solvers and dynamic indexing capabilities.\n\n<h3>Vector Assignment</h3>\nx = c(1, 2, 3, 4)\nIn most contexts, <code>=</code> can be switched with <code>=</code>.\nThe function <code>assign()</code> can also be used:\nassign(&#x27;x&#x27;, c(1, 2, 3, 4))\nAssignments can also be made in the other direction:\nc(1, 2, 3, 4) -> x\n\n<h3>Vector Operations</h3>Vectors can also be used in a variety of ways.\nThe operation<code> y = c(x, 0, x)</code> would assign a vector <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 </code>to variable <code>y</code>.\nVectors can be freely multiplied and added by constants:\nv = 2*x + y + 1\nNote that this operation is valid even when <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are different lengths. \nIn this case, R will simply recycle x (sometimes fractionally) until it meets the length of y. \nSince y is 9 numbers long and x is 4 units long, x will be repeated 2.25 times to match the length of y.\nThe arithmetic operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>^</code> can all be used. \n<code>log</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>tan</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, and more can also be used. \n<code>max(x)</code> and <code>min(x)</code> represent the largest and smallest elements of a vector <code>x</code>, and <code>length(x)</code> is the number of elements in <code>x</code>. \n<code>sum(x)</code> gives the total of the elements in <code>x</code>, and <code>prod(x)</code> their product.\n<code>mean(x)</code> calculates the sample mean, and <code>var(x)</code> returns the sample variance. \n<code>sort(x)</code> returns a vector of the same size as x with elements arranged in increasing order.\n\n<h3>Generating Sequences</h3>R has many methods for generating sequences of numbers. \n<code>1:30</code> is the same as <code>c(1, 2, …, 29, 30)</code>. \nThe colon as the highest priority in an expression, so<code>2*1:15</code> will return <code>c(2, 4, …, 28, 30)</code> instead of <code>c(2, 3, …, 14, 15)</code>.\n30:1 may be used to generate the sequence backwards.\nThe <code>seq()</code> function can also be used to generate sequences. \n<code>seq(2,10) </code>returns the same vector as <code>2:10</code>. \nIn <code>seq()</code>, one can also specify the length of the step in which to take: <code>seq(1,2,by=0.5)</code> returns <code>c(1, 1.5, 2)</code>.\nA similar function is <code>rep()</code>, which replicates an object in various ways. \nFor example, <code>rep(x, times=5)</code> will return five copies of <code>x</code> end-to-end.\n\n<h3>Logical Vectors</h3>Logical values in R are TRUE, FALSE, and NA. \nLogical vectors are set by conditions. \n<code>val = x > 13</code> sets <code>val</code> as a vector of the same length as <code>x</code> with values <code>TRUE</code> where the condition is met and <code>FALSE</code> where the condition is not.\nThe logical operators in r are <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>></code>, <code>>=</code>, <code>==</code>, and <code>!=</code>, which mean less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, equality, and inequality.\n\n<h3>Missing Values</h3>The function <code>is.na(x)</code> returns a logical vector of the same size as <code>x</code> with <code>TRUE</code> if the corresponding element to <code>x</code> is <code>NA</code>.\n<code>x == NA</code> is different from <code>is.na(x)</code> since <code>NA</code> is not a value but a marker for an unavailable quantity.\nA second type of ‘missing value’ is that which is produced by numerical computation, such as <code>0/0</code>. \nIn this case, <code>NaN</code> (Not a Number) values are treated as <code>NA</code> values; that is, <code>is.na(x)</code> will return <code>TRUE</code> for both <code>NA</code> and <code>NaN</code> values. \n<code>is.nan(x)</code> can be used only for identifying <code>NaN</code> values.\n\n<h3>Indexing Vectors</h3>The first kind of indexing is through a logical vector. \n<code>y = x[!is.na(x)]</code> sets <code>y</code> to the values of <code>x</code> that are not equal to <code>NA</code> or <code>NaN</code>.\n<code>(x+1)[(!is.na(x)) & x>0] -> z</code> sets <code>z</code> to the values of <code>x+1</code> that are not <code>Na</code> or <code>NaN</code> and larger than 0.\nA second method is with a vector of positive integral quantities. \nIn this case, the values must be in the set <code>{1, 2, …, length(x)}</code>. \nThe corresponding elements of the vector are selected and concatenated in that order to form a result. \nIt is important to remember that unlike in other languages, the first index in R is 1 and not 0.\n<code>x[1:10]</code> returns the first 10 elements of <code>x</code>, assuming <code>length(x)</code> is not less than 10. \n<code>c(‘x’, ‘y’)[rep(c(1,2,2,1), times=4)]</code> produces a character vector of length 16, where <code>‘x’, ‘y’, ‘y’, ‘x’</code> is repeated four times.\nA vector of negative integral numbers specifies the values to be excluded rather than included. \n<code>y = x[-(1:5)]</code> sets <code>y</code> to all but the first five values of <code>x</code>.\nLastly, a vector of character strings can be used when an object has a names attribute to identify its components. \nWith fruit <code>= c(1, 2, 3, 4)</code>, one can set the names of each index of the vector fruit with <code>names(fruit) = c(‘mango’, ‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘orange’)</code>. \nThen, one can call the elements by name with <code>lunch = fruit[c(‘apple’, ‘orange’)]</code>.\nThe advantage of this is that alphanumeric names can sometimes be easier to remember than indices.\nNote that an indexed expression can also appear on the receiving end of an assignment, in which the assignment is only performed on those elements of a vector. \nFor example, <code>x[is.na(x)] = 0</code> replaces all <code>NA</code> and <code>NaN</code> values in vector <code>x</code> with the value <code>0</code>.\nAnother example: <code>y[y&lt;0] = -y[y&lt;0]</code> has the same effect as <code>y = abs(y)</code>. \nThe code simply replaces all the values that are less than 0 with the negative of that value.\n<h3>Arrays & Matrices</h3>\n<h3>Arrays</h3>An array is a subscripted collection of data entries, not necessarily numeric.\nA dimension vector is a vector of non-negative integers. \nIf the length is <em>k</em> then the array is <em>k</em>-dimensional. \nThe dimensions are indexed from one up to the values given in the dimension vector.\nA vector can be used by R as an array as its <code>dim </code>attribute. \nIf <code>z</code> were a vector of 1500 elements, the assignment <code>dim(z) = c(100, 5, 3)</code> would mean <code>z</code> is now treated as a 100 by 5 by 3 array.\n\n<h3>Array Indexing</h3>Individual elements of an array can be referenced by giving the name of the array followed by the subscripts in square brackets, separated by columns.\nA 3 by 4 by 6 vector <code>a</code> could have its first value called via <code>a[1, 1, 1]</code> and its last value called via <code>a[3, 4, 6]</code>.\n<code>a[,,]</code> represents the entire array; hence, <code>a[1,1,]</code> takes the first row of the first 2-dimensional cross-section in <code>a</code>.\n\n<h3>Indexing Matrices</h3>The following code generates a 4 by 5 array: <code>x = array(1:20, dim = c(4,5))</code>.\nArrays are specified by a vector of values and the dimensions of the matrix. \nValues are calculated top-down first, left-right second.\n<code>array(1:4, dim = c(2,2))</code> would return\n1 3\n2 4\nand not\n1 2\n3 4\nNegative indices are not allowed in index matrices. \n<code>NA</code> and zero values are allowed.\n\n<h3>Outer Product of 2 Arrays</h3>An important operation on arrays is the outer product. \nIf <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are two numeric arrays, their outer product is an array whose dimension vector is obtained by concatenating the two dimension vectors and whose data vector is achieved by forming all possible products of elements of the data vector of <code>a</code> with those of <code>b</code>. \nThe outer product is calculated with the operator <code>%o%</code>:\n<code>ab = a %o% b</code>\nAnother way to achieve this is\n<code>ab = outer(a, b, ‘*’)</code>\nIn fact, any function can be applied on two arrays using the outer() function. \nSuppose we define a function <code>f = function(x, y) cos(y)/(1+x2)</code>. \nThe function could be applied to two vectors <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> via <code>z = outer(x, y, f)</code>.\n\n<h3>Demonstration: All Possible Determinants of 2x2 Single-Digit Matrices</h3>Consider the determinants of 2 by 2 matrices [a, b; c, d] where each entry is a non-negative integer from 0 to 9. \nThe problem is to find the determinants of all possible matrices in this form and represent the frequency of which the value occurs with a high density plot.\nRephrased, find the probability distribution of the determinant if each digit is chosen independently and uniformly at random.\nOne clever way of doing this uses the outer(0 function twice.\nd = outer(0:9,0:9)\nfr = table(outer(d, d, ‘-’))\nplot(fr, xlab = ‘Determinant’, ylab = ‘Frequency’)\nThe first line assigns d to this matrix:\nThe second line uses the outer() function again to calculate all possible determinants, and the last line plots it.\nGeneralized Transpose of an Array</h3>The function <code>aperm(a, perm)</code> can be used to permute an array a. \nThe argument perm must be the permutation of the integers {1,…, <em>k</em>} where <em>k</em> is the number of subscripts in <em>a</em>. \nThe result of the function is an array of the same size as a but with the old dimension given by <code>perm[j]</code> becoming the new <code>j-th</code> dimension.\nAn easy way to think about it is a generalization of transposition for matrices. \nIf <code>A</code> is a matrix, then <code>B</code> is simply the transpose of <code>A</code>:\nB = aperm(A, c(2, 1))\nIn these special cases the function <code>t()</code> performs a transposition.\n\n<h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>The operator %*% is used for matrix multiplication. \nIf <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are square matrices of the same size, <code>A*B</code> is the element-wise product of the two matrices. \n<code>A %*% B</code> is the dot product (matrix product).\nIf x is a vector, then <code>x %*% A %*% x</code> is a quadratic form.\n<code>crossprod()</code> performs cross-products; thus, <code>crossprod(X, y)</code> is the same as the operation <code>t(X) %*% y</code>, but more efficient.\n<code>diag(v)</code>, where <code>v</code> is a vector, gives a diagonal matrix with elements of the vector as the diagonal entries. \n<code>diag(M)</code>, where <code>m</code> is a matrix, gives the vector of the main diagonal entries of <code>M</code> (the same convention as in Matlab). \n<code>diag(k)</code>, where <code>k</code> is a single numeric value, returns a <code>k</code> by <code>k</code> identity matrix.\n\n<h3>Linear Equations and Inversion</h3>Solving linear equations is the inverse of matrix multiplication. \nWhen\nb = A %*% x\nwith only <code>A</code> and <code>b</code> given, vector <code>x</code> is the solution of the linear equation system. \nThis can be solved quickly in R with\nsolve(A, b)\n\n<h3>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h3>The function <code>eigen(Sm)</code> calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix Sm. \nThe result is a list, with the first element named values and the second named vectors. \n<code>ev = eigen(Sm)</code> assigns this list to <code>ev</code>.\n<code>ev$val</code> is the vector of eigenvalues of <code>Sm</code> and <code>ev$vec</code> the matrix of corresponding eigenvectors.\nFor large matrices, it is better to avoid computing the eigenvectors if they are not needed by using the expression\nevals = eigen(Sm, only.values = TRUE)$values\n\n<h3>Singular Value Decomposition and Determinants</h3>The function <code>svd(m)</code> takes an arbitrary matrix argument, <code>m</code>, and calculates the singular value decomposition of <code>m</code>. \nThis consists of a matrix of orthonormal columns <code>U</code> with the same column space as <code>m</code>, a second matrix of orthonormal columns <code>V</code> whose column space is the row space of <code>m</code> and a diagonal matrix of positive entries <code>D</code> such that\nm = U %*% D %*% t(V)\n<code>det(m)</code> can be used to calculate the determinant of a square matrix <code>m</code>.\n\n<h3>Least Squares Fitting & QR Decomposition</h3>The function <code>lsfit()</code> returns a list giving results of a least squares fitting procedure. \nAn assignment like\nans = lsfit(X, y)\ngives results of a least squares fit where y is the vector of observations and X is the design matrix.\n<code>ls.diag()</code> can be used for regression diagnostics.\nA closely related function is qr().\nb = qr.coef(Xplus,y)\nfit = qr.fitted(Xplus,y)\nres = qr.resid(Xplus,y)\nThese compute the orthogonal projection of <code>y</code> onto the range of <code>X</code> in <code>fit</code>, the projection onto the orthogonal complement in <code>res</code> and the coefficient vector for the projection in <code>b</code>.\n\n<h3>Forming Partitioned <code>Matrices</code></h3>Matrices can be built up from other vectors and matrices with the functions <code>cbind()</code> and <code>rbind()</code>.\n<code>cbind()</code> forms matrices by binding matrices horizontally (column-wise), and <code>rbind()</code> binds matrices vertically (row-wise).\nIn the assignment <code>X = cbind(arg_1, arg_2, arg_3, …)</code> the arguments to <code>cbind()</code> must be either vectors of any length, or columns with the same column size (the same number of rows).\n<code>rbind()</code> performs a corresponding operation for rows.\n',

'<h2>Machine Learning in R for beginners</h2>\nThis small tutorial is meant to introduce you to the basics of machine learning in R: it will show you how to use R to work with KNN.\n\n<h3>Introducing: Machine Learning in R</h3>\nMachine learning is a branch in computer science that studies the design of algorithms that can learn. \nTypical machine learning tasks are concept learning, function learning or “predictive modeling”, clustering and finding predictive patterns. \nThese tasks are learned through available data that were observed through experiences or instructions, for example. \nMachine learning hopes that including the experience into its tasks will eventually improve the learning. \nThe ultimate goal is to improve the learning in such a way that it becomes automatic, so that humans like ourselves don’t need to interfere any more.\n\nThis small tutorial is meant to introduce you to the basics of machine learning in R: more specifically, it will show you how to use R to work with the well-known machine learning algorithm called “KNN” or <em>k</em>-nearest neighbors.\n\n<h3>Using R For <em>k</em>-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h3>\nThe KNN or <em>k</em>-nearest neighbors algorithm is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms and is an example of instance-based learning, where new data are classified based on stored, labeled instances.\n\nMore specifically, the distance between the stored data and the new instance is calculated by means of some kind of a similarity measure. \nThis similarity measure is typically expressed by a distance measure such as the Euclidean distance, cosine similarity or the Manhattan distance.\n\nIn other words, the similarity to the data that was already in the system is calculated for any new data point that you input into the system.\n\nThen, you use this similarity value to perform predictive modeling. \nPredictive modeling is either classification, assigning a label or a class to the new instance, or regression, assigning a value to the new instance. \nWhether you classify or assign a value to the new instance depends of course on your how you compose your model with KNN.\n\nThe <em>k</em>-nearest neighbor algorithm adds to this basic algorithm that after the distance of the new point to all stored data points has been calculated, the distance values are sorted and the <em>k</em>-nearest neighbors are determined. \nThe labels of these neighbors are gathered and a majority vote or weighted vote is used for classification or regression purposes.\n\nIn other words, the higher the score for a certain data point that was already stored, the more likely that the new instance will receive the same classification as that of the neighbor. \nIn the case of regression, the value that will be assigned to the new data point is the mean of its <em>k</em> nearest neighbors.\n\n<h3>Step One. Get Your Data</h3>\nMachine learning usually starts from observed data. \nYou can take your own data set or browse through other sources to find one.\n\n<h3>Built-in Datasets of R</h3>\nThis tutorial uses the Iris data set, which is very well-known in the area of machine learning. \nThis dataset is built into R, so you can take a look at this dataset by typing the following into your console:\n\niris\n\n# Print first lines\nhead(iris)\n\n<h3>Step Two. Know Your Data</h3>\nJust looking or reading about your data is certainly not enough to get started!\n\nYou need to get your hands dirty, explore and visualize your data set and even gather some more domain knowledge if you feel the data is way over your head.\n\nProbably you’ll already have the domain knowledge that you need, but just as a reminder, all flowers contain a sepal and a petal. \nThe sepal encloses the petals and is typically green and leaf-like, while the petals are typically colored leaves. \nFor the iris flowers, this is just a little bit different, as you can see in the following picture:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Machine+Learning+R/iris-machinelearning.png" />\n\n<h3>Initial Overview Of The Data Set</h3>\nFirst, you can already try to get an idea of your data by making some graphs, such as histograms or boxplots. \nIn this case, however, scatter plots can give you a great idea of what you’re dealing with: it can be interesting to see how much one variable is affected by another.\n\nIn other words, you want to see if there is any correlation between two variables.\n\nYou can make scatterplots with the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggvis"><code>ggvis</code> package</a>, for example.\n\n<k>Note</k> that you first need to load the <code>ggvis</code> package:\n\n<code># Load in \nggvis\n\nlibrary(ggvis)\n\n# Iris scatter plot\niris %>% ggvis(~Sepal.Length, ~Sepal.Width, fill = ~Species) %>% layer_points()</code>\n\n<img alt="correlation iris" height="499" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Machine+Learning+R/plot_768312428.png" width="817" />\n\nYou see that there is a high correlation between the sepal length and the sepal width of the Setosa iris flowers, while the correlation is somewhat less high for the Virginica and Versicolor flowers: the data points are more spread out over the graph and don’t form a cluster like you can see in the case of the Setosa flowers.\n\nThe scatter plot that maps the petal length and the petal width tells a similar story:\n\n<code>iris %>% ggvis(~Petal.Length, ~Petal.Width, fill = ~Species) %>% layer_points()</code>\n\n<img alt="scatterplot iris" height="500" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Machine+Learning+R/plot_675020181.png" width="817" />\n\nYou see that this graph indicates a positive correlation between the petal length and the petal width for all different species that are included into the Iris data set. \nOf course, you probably need to test this hypothesis a bit further if you want to be really sure of this:\n\n# Overall correlation \nPetal.Length\n and \nPetal.Width\n\ncor(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width)\n\n# Return values of \niris\n levels \nx=levels(iris$Species)\n\n# Print Setosa correlation matrix\nprint(x[1])\ncor(iris[iris$Species==x[1],1:4])\n\n# Print Versicolor correlation matrix\nprint(x[2])\ncor(iris[iris$Species==x[2],1:4])\n\n# Print Virginica correlation matrix\nprint(x[3])\ncor(iris[iris$Species==x[3],1:4])\n\nYou see that when you combined all three species, the correlation was a bit stronger than it is when you look at the different species separately: the overall correlation is 0.96, while for Versicolor this is 0.79. \nSetosa and Virginica, on the other hand, have correlations of petal length and width at 0.31 and 0.32 when you round up the numbers.\n\n<b>Tip</b>: are you curious about ggvis, graphs or histograms in particular? Check out our <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/make-histogram-basic-r/">histogram tutorial</a> and/or <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorial/">ggvis course</a>.\n\nAfter a general visualized overview of the data, you can also view the data set by entering\n\n# Return all \niris\n data\niris\n\n# Return first 5 lines of \niris\n\nhead(iris)\n\n# Return structure of \niris\n\nstr(iris)\n\nHowever, as you will see from the result of this command, this really isn’t the best way to inspect your data set thoroughly: the data set takes up a lot of space in the console, which will impede you from forming a clear idea about your data. \nIt is therefore a better idea to inspect the data set by executing <code>head(iris)</code> or <code>str(iris)</code>.\n\nNote that the last command will help you to clearly distinguish the data type <code>num</code> and the three levels of the <code>Species</code> attribute, which is a factor. \nThis is very convenient, since many R machine learning classifiers require that the target feature is coded as a factor.\n\nRemember that factor variables represent categorical variables in R. \nThey can thus take on a limited number of different values.\n\nA quick look at the <code>Species</code> attribute through tells you that the division of the species of flowers is 50-50-50. \nOn the other hand, if you want to check the percentual division of the <code>Species</code> attribute, you can ask for a table of proportions:\n\n# Division of \nSpecies\n\ntable(iris$Species) \n\n# Percentual division of \nSpecies\n\nround(prop.table(table(iris$Species)) * 100, digits = 1)\n\n<k>Note</k> that the <code>round</code> argument rounds the values of the first argument, <code>prop.table(table(iris$Species))*100</code> to the specified number of digits, which is one digit after the decimal point. \nYou can easily adjust this by changing the value of the <code>digits</code> argument.\n\n<h3>Profound Understanding Of Your Data</h3>\nLet’s not remain on this high-level overview of the data! R gives you the opportunity to go more in-depth with the <code>summary()</code> function. \nThis will give you the minimum value, first quantile, median, mean, third quantile and maximum value of the data set Iris for numeric data types. \nFor the class variable, the count of factors will be returned:\n\n# Summary overview of \niris\n\nsummary(....) \n\n# Refined summary overview\nsummary(....[c("Petal.Width", "Sepal.Width")])\n\nAs you can see, the <code>c()</code> function is added to the original command: the columns <code>petal width</code> and <code>sepal width</code> are concatenated and a summary is then asked of just these two columns of the Iris data set.\n\n<h3>Step Three. Where To Go Now?</h3>\nAfter you have acquired a good understanding of your data, you have to decide on the use cases that would be relevant for your data set. \nIn other words, you think about what your data set might teach you or what you think you can learn from your data. \nFrom there on, you can think about what kind of algorithms you would be able to apply to your data set in order to get the results that you think you can obtain.\nFrom there on, you can think about what kind of algorithms you would be able to apply to your data set in order to get the results that you think you can obtain.\n\n<k>Tip</k>: keep in mind that the more familiar you are with your data, the easier it will be to assess the use cases for your specific data set. \nThe same also holds for finding the appropriate machine algorithm.\n\nFor this tutorial, the Iris data set will be used for classification, which is an example of predictive modeling. \nThe last attribute of the data set, <code>Species</code>, will be the target variable or the variable that you want to predict in this example.\n\n<k>Note</k> that you can also take one of the numerical classes as the target variable if you want to use KNN to do regression.\n\n<h3>Step Four. Prepare Your Workspace</h3>\nMany of the algorithms used in machine learning are not incorporated by default into R. \nYou will most probably need to download the packages that you want to use when you want to get started with machine learning.\n\n<b>Tip</b>: got an idea of which learning algorithm you may use, but not of which package you want or need? You can find a pretty complete overview of all the packages that are used in R <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/domains/MachineLearning">right here</a>.\n\nTo illustrate the KNN algorithm, this tutorial works with the package <code>class</code>:\n\nlibrary(.....)\n\nIf you don’t have this package yet, you can quickly and easily do so by typing the following line of code:\n\n<code>install.packages("&lt;package name>")</code>\n\n<k>Remember</k> the nerd tip: if you’re not sure if you have this package, you can run the following command to find out!\n\n<code>any(grepl("&lt;name of your package>", installed.packages()))</code>\n\n<h3>Step Five. Prepare Your Data</h3>\nAfter exploring your data and preparing your workspace, you can finally focus back on the task ahead: making a machine learning model. \nHowever, before you can do this, it’s important to also prepare your data. \nThe following section will outline two ways in which you can do this: by normalizing your data (if necessary) and by splitting your data in training and testing sets.\n\n<h3>Normalization</h3>\nAs a part of your data preparation, you might need to normalize your data so that its consistent. \nFor this introductory tutorial, just remember that normalization makes it easier for the KNN algorithm to learn. \nThere are two types of normalization:\n\nexample normalization is the adjustment of each example individually, while\nfeature normalization indicates that you adjust each feature in the same way across all examples.\n\nSo when do you need to normalize your dataset?\n\nIn short: when you suspect that the data is not consistent.\n\nYou can easily see this when you go through the results of the <code>summary()</code> function. \nLook at the minimum and maximum values of all the (numerical) attributes. \nIf you see that one attribute has a wide range of values, you will need to normalize your dataset, because this means that the distance will be dominated by this feature.\n\nFor example, if your dataset has just two attributes, X and Y, and X has values that range from 1 to 1000, while Y has values that only go from 1 to 100, then Y’s influence on the distance function will usually be overpowered by X’s influence.\n\nWhen you normalize, you actually adjust the range of all features, so that distances between variables with larger ranges will not be over-emphasised.\n\n<b>Tip</b>: go back to the result of <code>summary(iris)</code> and try to figure out if normalization is necessary.\n\nThe Iris data set doesn’t need to be normalized: the <code>Sepal.Length</code> attribute has values that go from 4.3 to 7.9 and <code>Sepal.Width</code> contains values from 2 to 4.4, while <code>Petal.Length</code>’s values range from 1 to 6.9 and <code>Petal.Width</code> goes from 0.1 to 2.5. \nAll values of all attributes are contained within the range of 0.1 and 7.9, which you can consider acceptable.\n\nNevertheless, it’s still a good idea to study normalization and its effect, especially if you’re new to machine learning. \nYou can perform feature normalization, for example, by first making your own <code>normalize()</code> function.\n\nYou can then use this argument in another command, where you put the results of the normalization in a data frame through <code>as.data.frame()</code> after the function <code>lapply()</code> returns a list of the same length as the data set that you give in. \nEach element of that list is the result of the application of the <code>normalize</code> argument to the data set that served as input:\n\n<code>YourNormalizedDataSet = as.data.frame(lapply(YourDataSet, normalize))</code>\n\nTest this in the DataCamp Light chunk below!\n\n# Build your own \nnormalize()\n function\nnormalize = function(x) {\nnum = x - min(x)\ndenom = max(x) - min(x)\nreturn (num/denom)\n}\n\n# Normalize the \niris\n data\niris_norm = .............(......(iris[1:4], normalize))\n\n# Summarize \niris_norm\n\nsummary(.........)\n\nFor the Iris dataset, you would have applied the <code>normalize</code> argument on the four numerical attributes of the Iris data set (<code>Sepal.Length</code>, <code>Sepal.Width</code>, <code>Petal.Length</code>, <code>Petal.Width</code>) and put the results in a data frame.\n\n<k>Tip</k>: to more thoroughly illustrate the effect of normalization on the data set, compare the following result to the summary of the Iris data set that was given in step two.\n\n<h3>Training And Test Sets</h3>\nIn order to assess your model’s performance later, you will need to divide the data set into two parts: a training set and a test set.\n\nThe first is used to train the system, while the second is used to evaluate the learned or trained system. \nIn practice, the division of your data set into a test and a training sets is disjoint: the most common splitting choice is to take 2/3 of your original data set as the training set, while the 1/3 that remains will compose the test set.\n\nOne last look on the data set teaches you that if you performed the division of both sets on the data set as is, you would get a training class with all species of “Setosa” and “Versicolor”, but none of “Virginica”. \nThe model would therefore classify all unknown instances as either “Setosa” or “Versicolor”, as it would not be aware of the presence of a third species of flowers in the data.\n\nIn short, you would get incorrect predictions for the test set.\n\nYou thus need to make sure that all three classes of species are present in the training model. \nWhat’s more, the amount of instances of all three species needs to be more or less <em>equal</em> so that you do not favour one or the other class in your predictions.\n\nTo make your training and test sets, you first set a seed. \nThis is a number of R’s random number generator. \nThe major advantage of setting a seed is that you can get the same sequence of random numbers whenever you supply the same seed in the random number generator.\n\n<code>set.seed(1234)</code>\n\nThen, you want to make sure that your Iris data set is shuffled and that you have an equal amount of each species in your training and test sets.\n\nYou use the <code>sample()</code> function to take a sample with a size that is set as the number of rows of the Iris data set, or 150. \nYou sample with replacement: you choose from a vector of 2 elements and assign either 1 or 2 to the 150 rows of the Iris data set. \nThe assignment of the elements is subject to probability weights of 0.67 and 0.33.\n\n<code>ind = sample(2, nrow(iris), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.67, 0.33))</code>\n\n<k>Note</k> that the <code>replace</code> argument is set to <code>TRUE</code>: this means that you assign a 1 or a 2 to a certain row and then reset the vector of 2 to its original state. \nThis means that, for the next rows in your data set, you can either assign a 1 or a 2, each time again. \nThe probability of choosing a 1 or a 2 should not be proportional to the weights amongst the remaining items, so you specify probability weights. \nNote also that, even though you don’t see it in the DataCamp Light chunk, the seed has still been set to <code>1234</code>.\n\n<k>Remember</k> that you want your training set to be 2/3 of your original data set: that is why you assign “1” with a probability of 0.67 and the “2”s with a probability of 0.33 to the 150 sample rows.\n\nYou can then use the sample that is stored in the variable <code>ind</code> to define your training and test sets:\n\n# Compose training set\niris.training = ....[ind==1, 1:4]\n\n# Inspect training set\nhead(................)\n\n# Compose test set\niris.test = ....[ind==2, 1:4]\n\n# Inspect test set\nhead(...........)\n\n<k>Note</k> that, in addition to the 2/3 and 1/3 proportions specified above, you don’t take into account all attributes to form the training and test sets. \nSpecifically, you only take <code>Sepal.Length</code>, <code>Sepal.Width</code>, <code>Petal.Length</code> and <code>Petal.Width</code>. \nThis is because you actually want to predict the fifth attribute, <code>Species</code>: it is your target variable. \nHowever, you do want to include it into the KNN algorithm, otherwise there will never be any prediction for it.\n\nYou therefore need to store the class labels in factor vectors and divide them over the training and test sets:\n# Compose \niris\n training labels\niris.trainLabels = iris[ind==1,5]\n\n# Inspect result\nprint(iris.trainLabels)\n\n# Compose \niris\n test labels\niris.testLabels = iris[ind==2, 5]\n\n# Inspect result\nprint(iris.testLabels)\n\n<h3>Step Six. The Actual KNN Model</h3>\n<h3>Building Your Classifier</h3>\nAfter all these preparation steps, you have made sure that all your known (training) data is stored. \nNo actual model or learning was performed up until this moment. \nNow, you want to find the <em>k</em> nearest neighbors of your training set.\n\nAn easy way to do these two steps is by using the <code>knn()</code> function, which uses the Euclidian distance measure in order to find the <em>k</em>-nearest neighbours to your new, unknown instance. \nHere, the <em>k</em> parameter is one that you set yourself.\n\nAs mentioned before, new instances are classified by looking at the majority vote or weighted vote. \nIn case of classification, the data point with the highest score wins the battle and the unknown instance receives the label of that winning data point. \nIf there is an equal amount of winners, the classification happens randomly.\n\n<k>Note</k>: the <em>k</em> parameter is often an odd number to avoid ties in the voting scores.\n\n# Build the model\niris_pred = ...(train = iris.training, test = iris.test, cl = iris.trainLabels, k=3)\n\n# Inspect \niris_pred\n\n.........\n\nYou store into <code>iris_pred</code> the <code>knn()</code> function that takes as arguments the training set, the test set, the train labels and the amount of neighbours you want to find with this algorithm. \nThe result of this function is a factor vector with the predicted classes for each row of the test data.\n\n<k>Note</k> that you don’t want to insert the test labels: these will be used to see if your model is good at predicting the actual classes of your instances!\n\nYou see that when you inspect the the result, <code>iris_pred</code>, you’ll get back the factor vector with the predicted classes for each row of the test data.\n\n<h3>Step Seven. Evaluation of Your Model</h3>\nAn essential next step in machine learning is the evaluation of your model’s performance. \nIn other words, you want to analyze the degree of correctness of the model’s predictions.\n\nFor a more abstract view, you can just compare the results of <code>iris_pred</code> to the test labels that you had defined earlier:\n\n# Put \niris.testLabels\n in a data frame\nirisTestLabels = data.frame(................)\n\n# Merge \niris_pred\n and \niris.testLabels\n \nmerge = data.frame(........., ...............)\n\n# Specify column names for \nmerge\n\nnames(.....) = c("Predicted Species", "Observed Species")\n\n# Inspect \nmerge\n \nmerge\n\nYou see that the model makes reasonably accurate predictions, with the exception of one wrong classification in row 29, where “Versicolor” was predicted while the test label is “Virginica”.\n\nThis is already some indication of your model’s performance, but you might want to go even deeper into your analysis. \nFor this purpose, you can import the package <code>gmodels</code>:\n\n<code>install.packages("package name")</code>\n\nHowever, if you have already installed this package, you can simply enter\n\n<code>library(gmodels)</code>\n\nThen you can make a cross tabulation or a contingency table. \nThis type of table is often used to understand the relationship between two variables. \nIn this case, you want to understand how the classes of your test data, stored in <code>iris.testLabels</code> relate to your model that is stored in <code>iris_pred</code>:\n\n<code>CrossTable(x = iris.testLabels, y = iris_pred, prop.chisq=FALSE)</code>\n\n<img alt="Crosstable iris knn" height="698" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Machine+Learning+R/Screenshot-2015-03-24-20.05.32.png" width="926" />\n\n<k>Note</k> that the last argument <code>prop.chisq</code> indicates whether or not the chi-square contribution of each cell is included. \nThe chi-square statistic is the sum of the contributions from each of the individual cells and is used to decide whether the difference between the observed and the expected values is significant.\n\nFrom this table, you can derive the number of correct and incorrect predictions: one instance from the testing set was labeled <code>Versicolor</code> by the model, while it was actually a flower of species <code>Virginica</code>. \nYou can see this in the first row of the “Virginica” species in the <code>iris.testLabels</code> column. \nIn all other cases, correct predictions were made. \nYou can conclude that the model’s performance is good enough and that you don’t need to improve the model!\n\n<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/" target="_blank">\n<img alt="Learn Python for Data Science With DataCamp" src="http://community.datacamp.com.s3.amazonaws.com/community/production/ckeditor_assets/pictures/293/content_blog_banner.png" /></a>\n\n<h3>Machine Learning in R with <code>caret</code></h3>\nIn the previous sections, you have gotten started with supervised learning in R via the KNN algorithm. \nAs you might not have seen above, machine learning in R can get really complex, as there are various algorithms with various syntax, different parameters, etc. \nMaybe you’ll agree with me when I say that remembering the different package names for each algorithm can get quite difficult or that applying the syntax for each specific algorithm is just too much.\n\nThat’s where the <code>caret</code> package can come in handy: it’s short for “Classification and Regression Training” and offers everything you need to know to solve supervised machine learning problems: it provides a uniform interface to a ton of machine learning algorithms. \nIf you’re a bit familiar with Python machine learning, you might see similarities with <code>scikit-learn</code>!\n\nIn the following, you’ll go through the steps as they have been outlined above, but this time, you’ll make use of <code>caret</code> to classify your data. \nNote that you have already done a lot of work if you’ve followed the steps as they were outlined above: you already have a hold on your data, you have explored it, prepared your workspace, etc. \nNow it’s time to preprocess your data with <code>caret</code>!\n\nAs you have done before, you can study the effect of the normalization, but you’ll see this later on in the tutorial.\n\nYou already know what’s next! Let’s split up the data in a training and test set. \nIn this case, though, you handle things a little bit differently: you split up the data based on the labels that you find in <code>iris$Species</code>. \nAlso, the ratio is in this case set at 75-25 for the training and test sets.\n\n# Create index to split based on labels  \nindex = createDataPartition(iris$Species, p=0.75, list=FALSE)\n\n# Subset training set with index\niris.training = iris[.......,]\n\n# Subset test set with index\niris.test = iris[-.........,]\n\nYou’re all set to go and train models now! But, as you might remember, <code>caret</code> is an extremely large project that includes a lot of algorithms. \nIf you’re in doubt on what algorithms are included in the project, you can get a list of all of them. \nPull up the list by running <code>names(getModelInfo())</code>, just like the code chunk below demonstrates. \nNext, pick an algorithm and train a model with the <code>train()</code> function:\n\n# Overview of algos supported by caret\nnames(getModelInfo())\n\n# Train a model\nmodel_knn = train(iris.training[, 1:4], iris.training[, 5], method=\'knn\')\n\nNote that making other models is extremely simple when you have gotten this far; You just have to change the <code>method</code> argument, just like in this example:\n\n<code>model_cart = train(iris.training[, 1:4], iris.training[, 5], method=\'rpart2\')</code>\n\nNow that you have trained your model, it’s time to predict the labels of the test set that you have just made and evaluate how the model has done on your data:\n\n# Predict the labels of the test set\npredictions=predict(object=model_knn,iris.test[,1:4])\n\n# Evaluate the predictions\ntable(predictions)\n\n# Confusion matrix \nconfusionMatrix(predictions,iris.test[,5])\n\nAdditionally, you can try to perform the same test as before, to examine the effect of preprocessing, such as scaling and centering, on your model. \nRun the following code chunk:\n\n# Train the model with preprocessing\nmodel_knn = train(iris.training[, 1:4], iris.training[, 5], method=\'knn\', preProcess=c("center", "scale"))\n\n# Predict values\npredictions=predict.train(object=model_knn,iris.test[,1:4], type="raw")\n\n# Confusion matrix\nconfusionMatrix(predictions,iris.test[,5])\n\n<h3>Move On To Big Data</h3>\nCongratulations! You’ve made it through this tutorial!\n\nThis tutorial was primarily concerned with performing basic machine learning algorithm KNN with the help of R. \nThe Iris data set that was used was small and overviewable; Not only did you see how you can perform all of the steps by yourself, but you’ve also seen how you can easily make use of a uniform interface, such as the one that <code>caret</code> offers, to spark your machine learning.\n\nBut you can do so much more!\n\nIf you have experimented enough with the basics presented in this tutorial and other machine learning algorithms, you might want to find it interesting to go further into R and data analysis.\n',
'<h2>Machine Learning in R with Example</h2>\nAs a kid, you might have come across a picture of a fish and you would have been told by your kindergarten teachers or parents that this is a fish and it has some specific features associated with it like it has fins, gills, a pair of eyes, a tail and so on. \n\nNow, whenever your brain comes across an image with those set of features, it automatically registers it as a fish because your brain has <em>learned </em>that it is a fish.\n\nThat\'s how our brain functions but what about a machine? If the same image is fed to a machine, how will the machine identify it to be a fish?\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture6.png">\n\nThis is where M<em>achine Learning</em> comes in. \n\nWe\'ll keep on feeding images of a fish to a computer with the tag "fish" until the <em>machine learns all the features associated</em> with a<em> fish. \n</em>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture7.png">\n\nOnce the machine learns all the features associated with a fish, we will feed it new data to determine how much has it learned.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture8.png">\n\nIn other words,<em> Raw Data/Training Data </em>is given to the machine, so that it <em>learns </em>all the features associated with the <em>Training Data. \n</em>Once, the learning is done, it is given <em>New Data/Test Data </em>to determine how well the machine has learned.\n\nLet us move ahead in this Machine Learning with R blog and understand about types of Machine Learning.\n<h3><k>Types of Machine Learning</k></h3><h3><k>Supervised Learning: </k></h3>\nSupervised Learning algorithm learns from a known data-set(Training Data) which has labels to make predictions.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture9.png">\n\nRegression and Classification are some examples of Supervised Learning.\n<h4><k>#Classification:</k></h4>\nClassification determines to which set of categories does a new observation belongs i.e. a classification algorithm learns all the features and labels of the training data and when new data is given to it, it has to assign labels to the new observations depending on what it has learned from the training data.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture10.png">\n\nFor this example, if the first observation is given the label "Man" then it is rightly classified but if it is given the label "Woman", the classification is wrong. \n\nSimilarly for the second observation, if the label given is "Woman", it is rightly classified, else the classification is wrong.\n<h4><k>#Regression: </k></h4>\nRegression is a supervised learning algorithm which helps in determining how does one variable influence another variable.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture11.png">\n\nOver here, "living_area" is the independent variable and "price" is the dependent variable i.e. we are determining how does "price" vary with respect to "living_area".\n<h3><k>Unsupervised Learning:</k></h3>\nUnsupervised learning algorithm draws inferences from data which does not have labels.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture12.png">\n\n<em>Clustering</em> is an example of unsupervised learning. \n\n"K-means", "Hierarchical", "Fuzzy C-Means" are some examples of clustering algorithms.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture13.png">\n\nIn this example, the set of observations is divided into two clusters. \n\nClustering is done on the basis of similarity between the observations. \n\nThere is a high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity i.e. there is a very high similarity between all the buses but low similarity between the buses and cars.\n\n<h3><k>Reinforcement Learning:</k></h3>\nReinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where the <em>machine/agent</em> in an <em>environment </em>learns ideal behavior in order to maximize its performance. \nSimple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn its behavior, this is known as the <em>reinforcement signal</em>.\n<h3><k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pacman.png">\n</k></h3>\nLet\'s take <em>pacman</em> for example. \n\nAs long as pacman keeps eating food, it earns points but when it crashes against a monster it loses it\'s life. \n\nThus pacman learns that it needs to eat more food and avoid monsters so as to improve it\'s performance.\n<h3><k>Implementing Machine Learning with R:</k></h3><h3><k>Linear Regression:</k></h3>\nWe\'ll be working with the diamonds data-set to implement linear regression algorithm:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/diamond.png">\n\nDescription of the data-set:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/diamond_description.png">\n\nPrior to building any model on the data, we are supposed to split the data into "train" and "test" sets. \n\nThe model will be built on the "train" set and it\'s accuracy will be checked on the "test" set.\n\nWe need to load the "caTools" package to split the data into two sets.\n\n<code>library(caTools)</code>\n"caTools" package provides a function "sample.split()" which helps in splitting the data.\n\n<code>sample.split(diamonds$price,SplitRatio = 0.65)->split_index</code>\n65% of the observations from price column have been assigned the "true" label and the rest 35% have been assigned "false" label.\n\n<code>subset(diamonds,split_index==T)->train\nsubset(diamonds,split_index==F)->test</code>\nAll the observations which have "true" label have been stored in the "<em>train" object</em> and those observations having "false" label have been assigned to the "test" set.\n\nNow that the splitting is done and we have our "train" and "test" sets, it\'s time to build the linear regression model on the training set.\n\nWe\'ll be using the "lm()" function to build the linear regression model on the "train" data. \n\nWe are determining the <em>price</em> of the diamonds with respect to all other variables of the data-set. \n\nThe built model is stored in the object "mod_regress".\n\n<code>lm(price~.,data = train)->mod_regress</code><em> </em>\nNow, that we have built the model, we need to make predictions on the "test" set. \n\n"predict()" function is used to get predictions. \n\nIt takes two arguments: the <em>built model</em> and the <em>test set. \n</em>The predicted results are stored in the "result_regress" object.\n\n<code>predict(mod_regress,test)->result_regress</code>\nLet\'s bind the actual price values from the "test" data-set and the predicted values into a single data-set using the "cbind()" function. \n\nThe new data-frame is stored in "Final_Data"\n\n<code>cbind(Actual=test$price,Predicted=result_regress)->Final_Data</code> \n<code>as.data.frame(Final_Data)->Final_Data</code>\nA glance at the "Final_Data" which comprises of actual values and predicted values:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final-data.png">\n\nLet\'s find the error by subtracting the predicted values from the actual values and add this error as a new column to the "Final_Data":\n\n<code>(Final_Data$Actual- Final_Data$Predicted)->error</code>\n<code>cbind(Final_Data,error)->Final_Data</code>\nA glance at the "Final_Data" which also comprises of the error in prediction:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final-data2.png">\n\nNow, we\'ll go ahead and calculate "<em>Root Mean Square Error" </em>which gives an aggregate error for all the predictions\n\n<code>rmse1=sqrt(mean(Final_Data$error^2))</code> \n<code>rmse1</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rmse1.png">\n\nGoing ahead, let\'s build another model, so that we can compare the accuracy of both these models and determine which is a better one.\n\nWe\'ll build a new linear regression model on the "train" set but this time, we\'ll be dropping the &#8216;x\' and &#8216;y\' columns from the independent variables i.e. the "price" of the diamonds is determined by all the columns except &#8216;x\' and &#8216;y\'.\n\nThe model built is stored in "mod_regress2": \n\n<code>lm(price~.-y-z,data = train)->mod_regress2</code>\nThe predicted results are stored in "result_regress2"\n \n\n<code>predict(mod_regress2,test)->result_regress2</code>\nActual and Predicted values are combined and stored in "Final_Data2":\n\n<code>cbind(Actual=test$price,Predicted=result_regress2)->Final_Data2</code> \n<code>as.data.frame(Final_Data2)->Final_Data2</code>\nLet\'s also add the error in prediction to "Final_Data2"\n\n<code>(Final_Data2$Actual- Final_Data2$Predicted)->error2</code>\n<code>cbind(Final_Data2,error2)->Final_Data2</code>\nA glance at "Final_Data2":\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final-data2.png">\n\nFinding Root Mean Square Error to get the aggregate error:\n\n<code>rmse2=sqrt(mean(Final_Data2$error^2))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rmse2.png">\n\nWe see that "rmse2" is marginally less than "rmse1" and hence the second model is marginally better than the first model.\n<h3><k>Classification:</k></h3>\nWe\'ll be working with the "car_purchase" data-set to implement <em>recursive partitioning </em>which is a classification algorithm.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/car-1.png">\n\nLet\'s split the data into "train" and "test" sets using "sample.split()" function from "caTools" package.\n\n<code>library(caTools)</code>\n65% of the observations from &#8216;Purchased\' column will be assigned "TRUE" labels and the rest will be assigned "FALSE" labels.\n\n<code>sample.split(car_purchase$Purchased,SplitRatio = 0.65)->split_values</code>\nAll those observations which have "TRUE" label will be stored into &#8216;train\' data and those observations having "FALSE" label will be assigned to &#8216;test\' data.\n\n<code>subset(car_purchase,split_values==T)->train_data</code>\n<code>subset(car_purchase,split_values==F)->test_data</code>\nTime to build the Recursive Partitioning algorithm:\n\nWe\'ll start off by loading the &#8216;rpart\' package:\n\n<code>library(rpart)</code>\n"Purchased" column will be the dependent variable and all other columns are the independent variables i.e. we are determining whether the person has bought the car or not with respect to all other columns. \n\nThe model is built on the "train_data" and the result is stored in "mod1".\n\n<code>rpart(Purchased~.,data = train_data)->mod1</code>\nLet\'s plot the result:\n\n<code>plot(mod1,margin = 0.1)</code> <code>text(mod1,pretty = T,cex=0.8)</code>\n<k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rplot.png">\n</k>\n\nNow, let\'s go ahead and predict the results on "test_data". \n\nWe are giving the built rpart model "mod1" as the first argument, the test set "test_data" as the second argument and prediction type as "class" for the third argument. \n\nThe result is stored in &#8216;result1\' object. \n\n<code>predict(mod1,test_data,type = "class")->result1</code>\nLet\'s evaluate the accuracy of the model using "confusionMatrix()" function from caret package.\n\n<code>library(caret)</code> <code></code><code>confusionMatrix(table(test_data$Purchased,result1))</code>\n<k>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/confusion.png">\n</k>\n\nThe confusion matrix tells us that out of the 90 observations where the person did not buy the car, 79 observations have been rightly classified as "No" and 11 have been wrongly classified as "YES". \n\nSimilarly, out of the 50 observations where the person actually bought the car, 47 have been rightly classified as "YES" and 3 have been wrongly classified as "NO".\n\nWe can find the accuracy of the model by dividing the correct predictions with total predictions i.e. (79+47)/(79+47+11+3).\n<h3><k>K-Means Clustering:</k></h3>\nWe\'ll work with "iris" data-set to implement k-means clustering:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/iris.png">\n\nLet\'s remove the "Species" column and create a new data-set which comprises only the first four columns from the &#8216;iris\' data-set.\n\n<code>iris[1:4]->iris_k</code>\nLet us take the number of clusters to be 3. \n\n"Kmeans()" function takes the input data and the number of clusters in which the data is to be clustered. \n\nThe syntax is : kmeans( data, k) where k is the number of cluster centers.\n\n<code>kmeans(iris_k,3)->k1</code>\nAnalyzing the clustering:\n\n<code>str(k1)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture15.png">\n\nThe str() function gives the structure of the kmeans which includes various parameters like withinss, betweenss, etc, analyzing which you can find out the performance of kmeans.\n\nbetweenss : Between sum of squares i.e. Intracluster similarity\n\nwithinss : Within sum of square i.e. Intercluster similarity\n\ntotwithinss : Sum of all the withinss of all the clusters i.e.Total intra-cluster similarity\n\nA good clustering will have a lower value of "tot.withinss" and higher value of "betweenss" which depends on the number of clusters &lsquo;k&rsquo; chosen initially. \n\nThe time is ripe to become an expert in Machine Learning to take advantage of new opportunities that come

'<h2>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</h2>\na programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", \n\nwhich can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), \n\nand code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). \n\nA feature of objects is an object\'s procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). \n\nIn OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.\n\nOOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n\nMany of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. \n\nSignificant object-oriented languages include Java, C++, C#, Python, R, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.\n',
'<h2>Reference classes</h2>\n<!-- http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/methods/ReferenceClasses -->\nR has three object oriented (OO) systems: [[S3]], [[S4]] and Reference Classes (where the latter were for a while referred to as [[R5]], yet their official name is Reference Classes). \nThis page describes this new reference-based class system.\n\nReference Classes (or refclasses) are new in R 2.12. \nThey fill a long standing need for mutable objects that had previously been filled by non-core packages like R.oo, proto and mutatr. \nWhile the core functionality is solid, reference classes are still under active development and some details will change. \nThe most up-to-date documentation for Reference Classes can always be found in ?ReferenceClasses.\n\nThere are two main differences between reference classes and S3 and S4:\n\nRefclass objects use message-passing OO\nRefclass objects are mutable: the usual R copy on modify semantics do not apply\n\nThese properties makes this object system behave much more like Java and C#. \nSurprisingly, the implementation of reference classes is almost entirely in R code - they are a combination of S4 methods and environments. \nThis is a testament to the flexibility of S4.\n\nParticularly suited for: simulations where you’re modelling complex state, GUIs.\n\nNote that when using reference based classes we want to minimise side effects, and use them only where mutable state is absolutely required. \nThe majority of functions should still be “functional”, and side effect free. \nThis makes code easier to reason about (because you don’t need to worry about methods changing things in surprising ways), and easier for other R programmers to understand.\n\nLimitations: can’t use enclosing environment - because that’s used for the object.\n\n<h3>Classes and instances</h3>\nCreating a new reference based class is straightforward: you use setRefClass. \nUnlike setClass from S4, you want to keep the results of that function around, because that’s what you use to create new objects of that type:\n\n# Or keep reference to class around.\nPerson = setRefClass("Person")\nPerson$new()\n\nA reference class has three main components, given by three arguments to setRefClass:\n\ncontains, the classes which the class inherits from. \nThese should be other reference class objects:\n\nsetRefClass("Polygon")\nsetRefClass("Regular")\n\n# Specify parent classes\nsetRefClass("Triangle", contains = "Polygon")\nsetRefClass("EquilateralTriangle", \n  contains = c("Triangle", "Regular"))\n\nfields are the equivalent of slots in S4. \nThey can be specified as a vector of field names, or a named list of field types:\n\nsetRefClass("Polygon", fields = c("sides"))\nsetRefClass("Polygon", fields = list(sides = "numeric"))\n\nThe most important property of refclass objects is that they are mutable, or equivalently they have reference semantics:\n\n    Polygon = setRefClass("Polygon", fields = c("sides"))\n    square = Polygon$new(sides = 4)\n    \n    triangle = square\n    triangle$sides = 3\n    \n    square$sides        \n\nmethods are functions that operate within the context of the object and can modify its fields. \nThese can also be added after object creation, as described below.\n\nsetRefClass("Dist")\nsetRefClass("DistUniform", c("a", "b"), "Dist", methods = list(\n  mean = function() {\n    (a + b) / 2\n  }\n))\n\nYou can also add methods after creation:\n\n# Instead of creating a class all at once:\nPerson = setRefClass("Person", methods = list(\n  say_hello = function() message("Hi!")\n))\n\n# You can build it up piece-by-piece\nPerson = setRefClass("Person")\nPerson$methods(say_hello = function() message("Hi!"))\n\nIt’s not currently possible to modify fields because adding fields would invalidate existing objects that didn’t have those fields.\n\nThe object returned by setRefClass (or retrieved later by getRefClass) is called a generator object. \nIt has methods:\n\nnew for creating new objects of that class. \nThe new method takes named arguments specifying initial values for the fields\n\nmethods for modifying existing or adding new methods\n\nhelp for getting help about methods\n\nfields to get a list of fields defined for class\n\nlock locks the named fields so that their value can only be set once\n\naccessors a convenience method that automatically sets up accessors of the form getXXX and setXXX.\n\n<h3>Methods</h3>\nRefclass methods are associated with objects, not with functions, and are called using the special syntax obj$method(arg1, arg2, ...). \n(You might recall we’ve seen this construction before when we called functions stored in a named list). \nMethods are also special because they can modify fields. \nThis is different\n\nWe’ve also seen this construct before, when we used closures to create mutable state. \nReference classes work in a similar manner but give us some extra functionality:\n\ninheritance\na way of documenting methods\na way of specifying fields and their types\n\nModify fields with &lt;=. \nWill call accessor functions if defined.\n\nSpecial fields: .self (Don’t use fields with names starting with . \nas these may be used for special purposes in future versions.)\n\ninitialize\n\n<h3>Common methods</h3>\nBecause all refclass classes inherit from the same superclass, envRefClass, they a have common set of methods:\n\nobj$callSuper:\n\nobj$copy: creates a copy of the current object. \nThis is necessary because Reference Classes classes don’t behave like most R objects, which are copied on assignment or modification.\n\nobj$field: named access to fields. \nEquivalent to slots for S4. \nobj$field("xxx") the same as obj$xxx. \nobj$field("xxx", 5) the same as obj$xxx = 5\n\nobj$import(x) coerces into this object, and obj$export(Class) coerces a copy of obj into that class. \nThese should be super classes.\n\nobj$initFields\n\n<h1>R S3 Class</h1>\nIn this article, you will learn to work with S3 classes (one of the three class systems in R programming).\n\nS3 class is the most popular and prevalent class in R programming language.\n\nMost of the classes that come predefined in R are of this type. \nThe fact that it is simple and easy to implement is the reason behind this.\n',
'<h2>How to define S3 class and create S3 objects?</h2>\nS3 class has no formal, predefined definition.\n\nBasically, a list with its class attribute set to some class name, is an S3 object. \nThe components of the list become the member variables of the object.\n\nFollowing is a simple example of how an S3 object of class student can be created.\n\n> # create a list with required components\n> s = list(name = "John", age = 21, GPA = 3.5)\n> # name the class appropriately\n> class(s) = "student"\n> # That\'s it! we now have an object of class "student"\n> s\n$name\n[1] "John"\n$age\n[1] 21\n$GPA\n[1] 3.5\nattr(,"class")\n[1] "student"\n\nThis might look awkward for programmers coming from C++, Python etc. \nwhere there are formal class definitions and objects have properly defined attributes and methods.\n\nIn R S3 system, it\'s pretty ad hoc. \nYou can convert an object\'s class according to your will with objects of the same class looking completely different. \nIt\'s all up to you.\n',
'<h2>How to use constructors to create objects?</h2>\nIt is a good practice to use a function with the same name as class (not a necessity) to create objects.\n\nThis will bring some uniformity in the creation of objects and make them look similar.\n\nWe can also add some integrity check on the member attributes. \nHere is an example. \nNote that in this example we use the attr() function to set the class attribute of the object.\n\n# a constructor function for the "student" class\nstudent = function(n,a,g) {\n# we can add our own integrity checks\nif(g>4 || g&lt;0)  stop("GPA must be between 0 and 4")\nvalue = list(name = n, age = a, GPA = g)\n# class can be set using class() or attr() function\nattr(value, "class") = "student"\nvalue\n}\n\nHere is a sample run where we create objects using this constructor.\n\n> s = student("Paul", 26, 3.7)\n> s\n$name\n[1] "Paul"\n$age\n[1] 26\n$GPA\n[1] 3.7\nattr(,"class")\n[1] "student"\n> class(s)\n[1] "student"\n> s = student("Paul", 26, 5)\nError in student("Paul", 26, 5) : GPA must be between 0 and 4\n> # these integrity check only work while creating the object using constructor\n> s = student("Paul", 26, 2.5)\n> # it\'s up to us to maintain it or not\n> s$GPA = 5\n',
'<h2>Methods and Generic Functions</h2>\nIn the above example, when we simply write the name of the object, its internals get printed.\n\nIn interactive mode, writing the name alone will print it using the print() function.\n\n> s\n$name\n[1] "Paul"\n$age\n[1] 26\n$GPA\n[1] 3.7\nattr(,"class")\n[1] "student"\n\nFurthermore, we can use print() with vectors, matrix, data frames, factors etc. \nand they get printed differently according to the class they belong to.\n\nHow does print() know how to print these variety of dissimilar looking object?\n\nThe answer is, print() is a generic function. \nActually, it has a collection of a number of methods. \nYou can check all these methods with methods(print).\n\n> methods(print)\n[1] print.acf*                                   \n[2] print.anova*\n...\n[181] print.xngettext*                             \n[182] print.xtabs*                                 \nNon-visible functions are asterisked\n\nWe can see methods like print.data.frame and print.factor in the above list.\n\nWhen we call print() on a data frame, it is dispatched to print.data.frame().\n\nIf we had done the same with a factor, the call would dispatch to print.factor(). \nHere, we can observe that the method names are in the form generic_name.class_name(). \nThis is how R is able to figure out which method to call depending on the class.\n\nPrinting our object of class "student" looks for a method of the form print.student(), but there is no method of this form.\n\nSo, which method did our object of class "student" call?\n\nIt called print.default(). \nThis is the fallback method which is called if no other match is found. \nGeneric functions have a default method.\n\nThere are plenty of generic functions like print(). \nYou can list them all with methods(class="default").\n\n> methods(class="default")\n[1] add1.default*            aggregate.default*      \n[3] AIC.default*             all.equal.default\n...\n',
'<h2>How to write your own method?</h2>\nNow let us implement a method print.student() ourself.\n\nprint.student = function(obj) {\ncat(obj$name, "/n")\ncat(obj$age, "years old/n")\ncat("GPA:", obj$GPA, "/n")\n}\n\nNow this method will be called whenever we print() an object of class "student".\n\nIn S3 system, methods do not belong to object or class, they belong to generic functions. \nThis will work as long as the class of the object is set.\n\n> # our above implemented method is called\n> s\nPaul \n26 years old\nGPA: 3.7 \n> # removing the class attribute will restore as previous\n> unclass(s)\n$name\n[1] "Paul"\n$age\n[1] 26\n$GPA\n[1] 3.7\n',
'<h2>Writing Your Own Generic Function</h2>\nIt is possible to make our own generic function like print() or plot(). \nLet us first look at how these functions are implemented.\n\n> print\nfunction (x, ...) \nUseMethod("print")\n&lt;bytecode: 0x0674e230>\n&lt;environment: namespace:base>\n> plot\nfunction (x, y, ...) \nUseMethod("plot")\n&lt;bytecode: 0x04fe6574>\n&lt;environment: namespace:graphics>\n\nWe can see that they have a single call to UseMethod() with the name of the generic function passed to it. \nThis is the dispatcher function which will handle all the background details. \nIt is this simple to implement a generic function.\n\nFor the sake of example, we make a new generic function called grade.\n\ngrade = function(obj) {\nUseMethod("grade")\n}\n\nA generic function is useless without any method. \nLet us implement the default method.\n\ngrade.default = function(obj) {\ncat("This is a generic function/n")\n}\n\nNow let us make method for our class "student".\n\ngrade.student = function(obj) {\ncat("Your grade is", obj$GPA, "/n")\n}\n\nA sample run.\n\n> grade(s)\nYour grade is 3.7\n\nIn this way, we implemented a generic function called grade and later a method for our class.\n\n<h1>R Inheritance</h1>\nIn this article, you’ll learn everything about inheritance in R. \nMore specifically, how to create inheritance in S3, S4 and Reference classes, and use them efficiently in your program.\n\nInheritance is one of the key features of object-oriented programming which allows us to define a new class out of existing classes.\n\nThis is to say, we can derive new classes from existing base classes and adding new features. \nWe don’t have to write from scratch. \nHence, inheritance provides reusability of code.\n\nInheritance forms a hierarchy of class just like a family tree. \nImportant thing to note is that the attributes define for a base class will automatically be present in the derived class.\n\nMoreover, the methods for the base class will work for the derived.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.datamentor.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/r-inheritance.jpg">\n\nBelow, we discuss how inheritance is carried out for the three different class systems in R programming language.\n',
'<h2>Inheritance in S3 Class</h2>\nS3 classes do not have any fixed definition. \nHence attributes of S3 objects can be arbitrary.\n\nDerived class, however, inherit the methods defined for base class. \nLet us suppose we have a function that creates new objects of class student as follows.\n\nstudent = function(n,a,g) {\nvalue = list(name=n, age=a, GPA=g)\nattr(value, "class") = "student"\nvalue\n}\n\nFurthermore, we have a method defined for generic function print() as follows.\n\nprint.student = function(obj) {\ncat(obj$name, "/n")\ncat(obj$age, "years old/n")\ncat("GPA:", obj$GPA, "/n")\n}\n\nNow we want to create an object of class InternationalStudent which inherits from student.\n\nThis is be done by assigning a character vector of class names like class(obj) = c(child, parent).\n\n> # create a list\n> s = list(name="John", age=21, GPA=3.5, country="France")\n> # make it of the class InternationalStudent which is derived from the class student\n> class(s) = c("InternationalStudent","student")\n> # print it out\n> s\nJohn \n21 years old\nGPA: 3.5\n\nWe can see above that, since we haven’t defined any method of the form print.InternationalStudent(), the method print.student() got called. \nThis method of class student was inherited.\n\nNow let us define print.InternationalStudent().\n\nprint.InternationalStudent = function(obj) {\ncat(obj$name, "is from", obj$country, "/n")\n}\n\nThis will overwrite the method defined for class student as shown below.\n\n> s\nJohn is from France\n\nWe can check for inheritance with functions like inherits() or is().\n\n> inherits(s,"student")\n[1] TRUE\n> is(s,"student")\n[1] TRUE\n',
'<h2>Inheritance in S4 Class</h2>\nSince S4 classes have proper definition, derived classes will inherit both attributes and methods of the parent class.\n\nLet us define a class student with a method for the generic function show().\n\n# define a class called student\nsetClass("student",\nslots=list(name="character", age="numeric", GPA="numeric")\n)\n# define class method for the show() generic function\nsetMethod("show",\n"student",\nfunction(object) {\ncat(object@name, "/n")\ncat(object@age, "years old/n")\ncat("GPA:", object@GPA, "/n")\n}\n)\n\nInheritance is done during the derived class definition with the argument contains as shown below.\n\n# inherit from student\nsetClass("InternationalStudent",\nslots=list(country="character"),\ncontains="student"\n)\n\nHere we have added an attribute country, rest will be inherited from the parent.\n\n> s = new("InternationalStudent",name="John", age=21, GPA=3.5, country="France")\n> show(s)\nJohn \n21 years old\nGPA: 3.5\n\nWe see that method define for class student got called when we did show(s).\n\nWe can define methods for the derived class which will overwrite methods of the base class, like in the case of S3 systems.\n',
'<h2>Inheritance in Reference Class</h2>\nInheritance in reference class is very much similar to that of the S4 class. \nWe define in the contains argument, from which base class to derive from.\n\nHere is an example of student reference class with two methods inc_age() and dec_age().\n\nstudent = setRefClass("student",\nfields=list(name="character", age="numeric", GPA="numeric"),\nmethods=list(\ninc_age = function(x) {\nage &lt;= age + x\n},\ndec_age = function(x) {\nage &lt;= age - x\n}\n)\n)\n\nNow we will inherit from this class. \nWe also overwrite dec_age() method to add an integrity check to make sure age is never negative.\n\nInternationalStudent = setRefClass("InternationalStudent",\nfields=list(country="character"),\ncontains="student",\nmethods=list(\ndec_age = function(x) {\nif((age - x)&lt;0)  stop("Age cannot be negative")\nage &lt;= age - x\n}\n)\n)\n\nLet us put it to test.\n\n> s = InternationalStudent(name="John", age=21, GPA=3.5, country="France")\n> s$dec_age(5)\n> s$age\n[1] 16\n> s$dec_age(20)\nError in s$dec_age(20) : Age cannot be negative\n> s$age\n[1] 16\n\nIn this way, we are able to inherit from the parent class.\n',
'<h2>R Reference Class</h2>\nIn this article, you will learn to work with reference classes in R programming which is one of the three class systems (other two are S3 and S4).\n\nReference class in R programming is similar to the object oriented programming we are used to seeing in common languages like C++, Java, Python etc.\n\nUnlike <a title="R S3 Class" href="/r-programming/S3-class">S3</a> and <a title="R S4 class" href="/r-programming/S4-class">S4 classes</a>, methods belong to class rather than generic functions. \nReference class are internally implemented as S4 classes with an environment added to it.\n\n<h3>How to define a reference class?</h3>\nDefining reference class is similar to defining a S4 class. \nInstead of setClass() we use the setRefClass() function.\n\n> setRefClass("student")\n\nMember variables of a class, if defined, need to be included in the class definition. \nMember variables of reference class are called fields (analogous to slots in S4 classes).\n\nFollowing is an example to define a class called student with 3 fields, name, age and GPA.\n\n> setRefClass("student", fields = list(name = "character", age = "numeric", GPA = "numeric"))\n\n<h3>How to create a reference objects?</h3>\nThe function setRefClass() returns a generator function which is used to create objects of that class.\n\n> student = setRefClass("student",\nfields = list(name = "character", age = "numeric", GPA = "numeric"))\n> # now student() is our generator function which can be used to create new objects\n> s = student(name = "John", age = 21, GPA = 3.5)\n> s\nReference class object of class "student"\nField "name":\n[1] "John"\nField "age":\n[1] 21\nField "GPA":\n[1] 3.5\n\n<h3>How to access and modify fields?</h3>\nFields of the object can be accessed using the $ operator.\n\n> s$name\n[1] "John"\n> s$age\n[1] 21\n> s$GPA\n[1] 3.5\n\nSimilarly, it is modified by reassignment.\n\n> s$name = "Paul"\n> s\nReference class object of class "student"\nField "name":\n[1] "Paul"\nField "age":\n[1] 21\nField "GPA":\n[1] 3.5\n\n<h4>Warning Note</h4>\n\nIn R programming, objects are copied when assigned to new variable or passed to a function (pass by value). \nFor example.\n\n> # create list a and assign to b\n> a = list("x" = 1, "y" = 2)\n> b = a\n> # modify b\n> b$y = 3\n> # a remains unaffected\n> a\n$x\n[1] 1\n$y\n[1] 2\n> # only b is modified\n> b\n$x\n[1] 1\n$y\n[1] 3\n\nBut this is not the case with reference objects. \nOnly a single copy exist and all variables reference to the same copy. \nHence the name, reference.\n\n> # create reference object a and assign to b\n> a = student(name = "John", age = 21, GPA = 3.5)\n> b = a\n> # modify b\n> b$name = "Paul"\n> # a and b both are modified\n> a\nReference class object of class "student"\nField "name":\n[1] "Paul"\nField "age":\n[1] 21\nField "GPA":\n[1] 3.5\n> b\nReference class object of class "student"\nField "name":\n[1] "Paul"\nField "age":\n[1] 21\nField "GPA":\n[1] 3.5\n\nThis can cause some unwanted change in values and be the source of strange bugs. \nWe need to keep this in mind while working with reference objects. \nTo make a copy, we can use the copy() method made availabe to us.\n\n> # create reference object a and assign a’s copy to b\n> a = student(name = "John", age = 21, GPA = 3.5)\n> b = a$copy()\n> # modify b\n> b$name = "Paul"\n> # a remains unaffected\n> a\nReference class object of class "student"\nField "name":\n[1] "John"\nField "age":\n[1] 21\nField "GPA":\n[1] 3.5\n> # only b is modified\n> b\nReference class object of class "student"\nField "name":\n[1] "Paul"\nField "age":\n[1] 21\nField "GPA":\n[1] 3.5\n\n<h3>Reference Methods</h3>\nMethods are defined for a reference class and do not belong to generic functions as in S3 and S4 classes.\n\nAll reference class have some methods predefined because they all are inherited from the superclass envRefClass.\n\n> student\nGenerator for class "student":\nClass fields:\nName:       name       age       GPA\nClass: character   numeric   numeric\nClass Methods:  \n"callSuper", "copy", "export", "field", "getClass", "getRefClass", \n"import", "initFields", "show", "trace", "untrace", "usingMethods"\nReference Superclasses:  \n"envRefClass"\n\nWe can see class methods like copy(), field() and show() in the above list. \nWe can create our own methods for the class.\n\nThis can be done during the class definition by passing a list of function definitions to methods argument of setRefClass().\n\nstudent = setRefClass("student",\nfields = list(name = "character", age = "numeric", GPA = "numeric"),\nmethods = list(\ninc_age = function(x) {\nage &lt;= age + x\n},\ndec_age = function(x) {\nage &lt;= age -

'<h2>Data Cleanup: Remove NA</h2>\ndata = data[!is.na(data)]\n\n<h3>Identifying missing values</h3>\nWe can test for the presence of missing values via the is.na() function.\n\n<code># remove na in r - test for missing values (is.na example)\ntest = c(1,2,3,NA)\nis.na(test)</code>\n\nIn the example above, is.na() will return a vector indicating which elements have a na value.\n\n<h3>na.omit() &#8211; remove rows with na from a list</h3>\nThis is the easiest option. \nThe na.omit() function returns a list without any rows that contain na values. \n\ntry na.omit() or na.exclude()\nmax( na.omit(vec) )\n\n<code># remove na in r - remove rows - na.omit function / option\nompleterecords = na.omit(datacollected) </code>\n\nPassing your data frame through the na.omit() function is a simple way to purge incomplete records from your analysis. \nIt is an efficient way to remove na values in r.\n\n<h3>complete.cases() &#8211; returns vector of rows with na values</h3>\nThe na.omit() function relies on the sweeping assumption that the dropped rows (removed the na values) are similar to the typical member of the dataset. \n\nWe accomplish this with the complete.cases() function. \nThis r function will examine a dataframe and return a vector of the rows which contain missing values. \nWe can examine the dropped records and purge them if we wish.\n\n<code># na in R - complete.cases example\nfullrecords =  collecteddata[!complete.cases(collecteddata)] droprecords =  collecteddata[complete.cases(collecteddata)] </code>\n\n<h3>Fix in place using&nbsp;na.rm</h3>\nFor certain statistical functions in R, you can guide the calculation around a missing value through including the na.rm parameter (na.rm=True). \nThe rows with na values are retained in the dataframe but excluded from the relevant calculations. \nSupport for this parameter varies by package and function, so please check the documentation for your specific package.\n\nThis is often the best option if you find there are significant trends in the observations with na values. \nUse the na.rm parameter to guide your code around the missing values and proceed from there. \nWe prepared a guide to using na.rm.\n\n<h3>NA Values and regression analysis</h3>\nRemoval of missing values can distort a regression analysis. \nThis is particularly true if you are working with higher order or more complicated models. \nFortunately, there are several options in the common packages for working around these issues.\n\nIf you are using the lm function, it includes a na.action option. \nAs part of defining your model, you can indicate how the regression function should handle missing values. \nTwo possible choices are na.omit and na.exclude. \nna.omit will omit all rows from the calculations. \nThe na.exclude option removes na values from the R calculations but makes an additional adjustment (padding out vectors with missing values) to maintain the integrity of the residual analytics and predictive calculations. \nThis is often more effective that procedures that delete rows from the calculations.\n\nYou also have the option of attempting to &#8220;heal&#8221; the data using custom procedures. \nIn this situation, map is.na against the data set to generate a logical vector that identifies which rows need to be adjusted. \nFrom there, you can build your own &#8220;healing&#8221; logic.\n',

'<h2>Gradient Boosting Machine</h2>\nGradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. \n\nH2O\'s Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) offers a Stochastic GBM, which can increase performance quite a bit compared to the original GBM implementation.\n\nNow we will train a basic GBM model\n\nThe GBM model will infer the response distribution from the response encoding if not specified explicitly through the "distribution" argument.\nA seed is required for reproducibility.\n\ngbm_fit1 = h2o.gbm(\n  x = x, y = y, training_frame = train, model_id = "gbm_fit1", seed = 1)\n\nNext we will increase the number of trees used in the GBM by setting "ntrees=500".\n\nThe default number of trees in an H2O GBM is 50, so this GBM will trained using ten times the default.\n\nIncreasing the number of trees in a GBM is one way to increase performance of the model, however, you have to be careful not to overfit your model to the training data by using too many trees.\n\nTo automatically find the optimal number of trees, you must use H2O\'s early stopping functionality.\n\nThis example will not do that, however, the following example will.\n\ngbm_fit2 = h2o.gbm(\n  x = x, y = y, training_frame = train, model_id = "gbm_fit2",\n    #validation_frame = valid, only used if stopping_rounds > 0\n  ntrees = 500, seed = 1)\n\nWe will again set "ntrees = 500", however, this time we will use early stopping in order to prevent overfitting (from too many trees).\n\nAll of H2O\'s algorithms have early stopping available, however early stopping is not enabled by default (with the exception of Deep Learning).\n\nThere are several parameters that should be used to control early stopping.\n\nThe three that are common to all the algorithms are: "stopping_rounds", "stopping_metric" and "stopping_tolerance".\n\nThe stopping metric is the metric by which you\'d like to measure performance, and so we will choose AUC here.\n\nThe "score_tree_interval" is a parameter specific to the Random Forest model and the GBM.\n\nSetting "score_tree_interval = 5" will score the model after every five trees.\n\nThe parameters we have set below specify that the model will stop training after there have been three scoring intervals where the AUC has not increased more than 0.0005.\n\nSince we have specified a validation frame, the stopping tolerance will be computed on validation AUC rather than training AUC. \n\ngbm_fit3 = h2o.gbm(\n  x = x, y = y, training_frame = train, model_id = "gbm_fit3",\n  validation_frame = valid,  #only used if stopping_rounds > 0\n  ntrees = 500, score_tree_interval = 5,      #used for early stopping\n                stopping_rounds = 3,          #used for early stopping\n                stopping_metric = "AUC",      #used for early stopping\n                stopping_tolerance = 0.0005,  #used for early stopping\n                seed = 1)\n\nLet\'s compare the performance of the two GBMs\n\ngbm_perf1 = h2o.performance(model = gbm_fit1, newdata = test)\ngbm_perf2 = h2o.performance(model = gbm_fit2, newdata = test)\ngbm_perf3 = h2o.performance(model = gbm_fit3, newdata = test)\n\n# Print model performance\ngbm_perf1\ngbm_perf2\ngbm_perf3\n\n# Retreive test set AUC\nh2o.auc(gbm_perf1)  # 0.682765594191\nh2o.auc(gbm_perf2)  # 0.671854616713\nh2o.auc(gbm_perf3)  # 0.68309902855\n\nTo examine the scoring history, use the "scoring_history" method on a trained model.\nIf "score_tree_interval" is not specified, it will score at various intervals, as we can see for "h2o.scoreHistory()" below.\nHowever, regular 5-tree intervals are used for "h2o.scoreHistory()".\nThe "gbm_fit2" was trained only using a training set (no validation set), so the scoring history is calculated for training set performance metrics only.\n\nh2o.scoreHistory(gbm_fit2)\n\nWhen early stopping is used, we see that training stopped at 105 trees instead of the full 500.\nSince we used a validation set in "gbm_fit3", both training and validation performance metrics are stored in the scoring history object.\nTake a look at the validation AUC to observe that the correct stopping tolerance was enforced.\n\nh2o.scoreHistory(gbm_fit3)\n\nLook at scoring history for third GBM model\n\nplot(gbm_fit3, timestep = "number_of_trees", metric = "AUC")\nplot(gbm_fit3, timestep = "number_of_trees", metric = "logloss")\n\n4. Deep Learning\nH2O\'s Deep Learning algorithm is a multilayer feed-forward artificial neural network.\nIt can also be used to train an autoencoder.\nIn this example we will train a standard supervised prediction model.\n\nTrain a default DL\nFirst we will train a basic DL model with default parameters.\nThe DL model will infer the response distribution from the response encoding if it is not specified explicitly through the "distribution" argument.\nH2O\'s DL will not be reproducible if it is run on more than a single core, so in this example, the performance metrics below may vary slightly from what you see on your machine.\nIn H2O\'s DL, early stopping is enabled by default, so below, it will use the training set and default stopping parameters to perform early stopping.\n\ndl_fit1 = h2o.deeplearning(x = x,\n     y = y,\n     training_frame = train,\n     model_id = "dl_fit1",\n     seed = 1)\n\nTrain a DL with new architecture and more epochs.\n\nNext we will increase the number of epochs used in the GBM by setting "epochs=20" (the default is 10).\nIncreasing the number of epochs in a deep neural net may increase performance of the model, however, you have to be careful not to overfit your model to your training data.\nTo automatically find the optimal number of epochs, you must use H2O\'s early stopping functionality.\nUnlike the rest of the H2O algorithms, H2O\'s DL will use early stopping by default, so for comparison we will first turn off early stopping.\nWe do this in the next example by setting "stopping_rounds=0".\n\ndl_fit2 = h2o.deeplearning(\n  x = x, y = y, training_frame = train, model_id = "dl_fit2",\n     #validation_frame = valid, only used if stopping_rounds > 0\n     epochs = 20, hidden= c(10,10),\n     stopping_rounds = 0,  #

Naive Bayes model\nThe Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm does not usually beat an algorithm like a Random Forest or GBM, however it is still a popular algorithm, especially in the text domain (when your input is text encoded as "Bag of Words", for example).\nThe Naive Bayes algorithm is for binary or multiclass classification problems only, not regression.\nTherefore, your response must be a factor instead of a numeric.\n\nFirst we will train a basic NB model with default parameters. \n\nnb_fit1 = h2o.naiveBayes(\n  x = x, y = y, training_frame = train, model_id = "nb_fit1")\n\nTrain a NB model with Laplace Smoothing\nOne of the few tunable model parameters for the Naive Bayes algorithm is the amount of Laplace smoothing. \nThe H2O Naive Bayes model will not use any Laplace smoothing by default.\n\nnb_fit2 = h2o.naiveBayes(\n  x = x, y = y, training_frame = train, model_id = "nb_fit2", laplace = 6)\n\nLet\'s compare the performance of the two NB models\nnb_perf1 = h2o.performance(model = nb_fit1, newdata = test)\nnb_perf2 = h2o.performance(model = nb_fit2, newdata = test)\n\n# Print model performance\nnb_perf1\nnb_perf2\n\n# Retreive test set AUC\nh2o.auc(nb_perf1)  # 0.6488014\nh2o.auc(nb_perf2)  # 0.6490678\n',

'<h2>The apply family</h2>\n<a href="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/" class="whitebut ">repeating-things</a>\n\nThere are several related function in R which allow you to apply some function to a series of objects (eg. vectors, matrices, dataframes or files). They include:\nlapply\nsapply\ntapply\naggregate\nmapply\napply\n\nEach repeats a function or operation on a series of elements, but they differ in the data types they accept and return. What they all in common is that <k>order of iteration is not important</k>.  This is crucial. If each each iteration is independent, then you can cycle through them in whatever order you like. Generally, we argue that you should only use the generic looping functions <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>repeat</code> when the order or operations <k>is</k> important. Otherwise reach for one of the apply tools.\n',
'<h2>lapply and sapply</h2>\n\n<code>lapply</code> applies a function to each element of a list (or vector), collecting results in a list.  <code>sapply</code> does the same, but will try to <em>simplify</em> the output if possible.\n\nLists are a very powerful and flexible data structure that few people seem to know about. Moreover, they are the building block for other data structures, like <code>data.frame</code> and <code>matrix</code>. To access elements of a list, you use the double square bracket, for example <code>X[[4]]</code> returns the fourth element of the list <code>X</code>. If you don’t know what a list is, we suggest you <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Lists-and-data-frames">read more about them</a>, before you proceed.\n<h3>Basic syntax</h3>\n<code>result = lapply(a list or vector, a function, ...)</code>\n\nThis code will also return a list, stored in <code>result</code>, with same number of elements as <code>X</code>.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\nlapply is great for building analysis pipelines, where you want to repeat a series of steps on a large number of similar objects.  The way to do this is to have a series of lapply statements, with the output of one providing the input to another:\n<code>first.step = lapply(X, first.function) second.step = lapply(first.step, next.function)</code>\n\nThe challenge is to identify the parts of your analysis that stay the same and those that differ for each call of the function. The trick to using <code>lapply</code> is to recognise that only one item can differ between different function calls.\n\nIt is possible to pass in a bunch of additional arguments to your function, but these must be the same for each call of your function. For example, let’s say we have a function <code>test</code> which takes the path of a file, loads the data, and tests it against some hypothesised value H0. We can run the function on the file\n“myfile.csv” as follows.\n\n<code>result = test("myfile.csv", H0=1)</code>\n\nWe could then run the test on a bunch of files using lapply:\n\n<code>files = c("myfile1.csv", "myfile2.csv", "myfile3.csv") result = lapply(files, test, H0=1)</code>\n\nBut notice, that in this example, the <k>only this that differs</k> between the runs is a single number in the file name. So we could save ourselves typing these by adding an extra step to generate the file names\n\n<code>files = lapply(1:10, function(x){paste0("myfile", x, ".csv")}) result = lapply(files, test, H0=1)</code>\n\nThe nice things about that piece of code is that it would extend as long as we wanted, to 10000000 files, if needed.\n\n<h3>Example - plotting temperature for many sites using open weather data</h3>\nLet’s look at the weather in some eastern Australian cities over the last couple of days.  The website\n<a href="http://openweathermap.org">openweathermap.com</a> provides access to all sorts of neat data, lots of it essentially real time.  We’ve parcelled up some on the nicercode website to use.  In theory, this sort of analysis script could use the weather data directly, but we don’t want to hammer their website too badly.  The code used to generate these files is <a href="https://gist.github.com/richfitz/5795029">here</a>.\n\nWe want to look at the temperatures over the last few days for the cities\n\n<code>cities = c("Melbourne", "Sydney", "Brisbane", "Cairns")</code>\n\nThe data are stored in a url scheme where the Sydney data is at\n<a href="http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/Sydney.csv">http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/Sydney.csv</a> and so on.  \n\nThe URLs that we need are therefore:\n\n<code>urls =\n sprintf("http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/%s.csv",\n         cities) urls</code>\n\n<code>[1] "http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/Melbourne.csv"\n[2] "http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/Sydney.csv"   \n[3] "http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/Brisbane.csv" \n[4] "http://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/data/Cairns.csv"   </code>\n\nWe can write a function to download a file if it does not exist:\n\n<code>download.maybe = function(url, refetch=FALSE, path=".") {\n dest = file.path(path, basename(url))\n if (refetch || !file.exists(dest))\n   download.file(url, dest)\n dest\n}</code>\nand then run that over the urls:\n\n<code>path = "data" dir.create(path, showWarnings=FALSE) files = sapply(urls, download.maybe, path=path) names(files) = cities</code>\n\nNotice that we never specify the order of which file is downloaded in which order; we just say “apply this function (<code>download.maybe</code>) to this list of urls.  We also pass the <code>path</code> argument to every function call.  So it was as if we’d written\n\n<code>download.maybe(urls[[1]], path=path) download.maybe(urls[[2]], path=path) download.maybe(urls[[3]], path=path) download.maybe(urls[[4]], path=path)</code>\nbut much less boring, and scalable to more files.\n\nThe first column, <code>time</code> of each file is a string representing date and time, which needs processing into R’s native time format (dealing with times in R (or frankly, in any language) is a complete pain).  In a real case, there might be many steps involved in processing each file.  We can make a function like this:\n\n<code>load.file = function(filename) {\n d = read.csv(filename, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)\n d$time = as.POSIXlt(d$time)\n d\n}</code>\nthat reads in a file given a filename, and then apply that function to each filename using <code>lapply</code>:\n\n<code>data = lapply(files, load.file) names(data) = cities</code>\n\nWe now have a <k>list</k>, where each element is a <code>data.frame</code> of weather data:\n\n<code>head(data$Sydney)</code>\n\n<code>             time  temp temp.min temp.max\n1 2013-06-13 23:00:00 12.66     8.89    16.11\n2 2013-06-14 00:00:00 15.90    12.22    20.00\n3 2013-06-14 02:00:00 18.44    16.11    20.00\n4 2013-06-14 03:00:00 18.68    16.67    20.56\n5 2013-06-14 04:00:00 19.41    17.78    22.22\n6 2013-06-14 05:00:00 19.10    17.78    22.22</code>\n\nWe can use <code>lapply</code> or <code>sapply</code> to easy ask the same question to each element of this list.  For example, how many rows of data are there?\n\n<code>sapply(data, nrow)</code>\n\n<code>Melbourne    Sydney  Brisbane    Cairns \n      97        99        99        80 </code>\n\nWhat is the hottest temperature recorded by city?\n\n<code>sapply(data, function(x) max(x$temp))</code>\n\n<code>Melbourne    Sydney  Brisbane    Cairns \n   12.85     19.41     22.00     31.67 </code>\nor, estimate the autocorrelation function for each set:\n\n<code>autocor = lapply(data, function(x) acf(x$temp, lag.max=24))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-221.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" /> \n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-222.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" /> \n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-223.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" /> \n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-224.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" />\n\n<code>plot(autocor$Sydney, main="Sydney")</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-225.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" />\n\n<code>plot(autocor$Cairns, main="Cairns")</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-226.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" />\n\nI find that for loops can be easier to plot data, partly because there is nothing to <em>collect</em> (or combine) at each iteration.\n\n<code>xlim = range(sapply(data, function(x) range(x$time))) ylim = range(sapply(data, function(x) range(x[-1]))) plot(data[[1]]$time, data[[1]]$temp, ylim=ylim, type="n",\n    xlab="Time", ylab="Temperature") cols = 1:4 for (i in seq_along(data))\n lines(data[[i]]$time, data[[i]]$temp, col=cols[i])</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-23.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-23" />\n\n<code>plot(data[[1]]$time, data[[1]]$temp, ylim=ylim, type="n",\n    xlab="Time", ylab="Temperature") mapply(function(x, col) lines(x$time, x$temp, col=col),\n      data, cols)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://nicercode.github.io/guides/repeating-things/img/unnamed-chunk-24.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-24" />\n\n<code>$Melbourne\nNULL\n\n$Sydney\nNULL\n\n$Brisbane\nNULL\n\n$Cairns\nNULL</code>\n\n<h3>Parallelising your code</h3>\nAnother great feature of lapply is that is <k>makes it really easy to parallelise your code</k>. All computers now contain multiple CPUs, and these can all be put to work using the great <a href="http://www.rforge.net/multicore/">multicore package</a>.\n\n<code>result = lapply(x, f)   #apply f to x using a single core and lapply\nlibrary(multicore) result = mclapply(x, f) #same thing using all the cores in your machine</code>\n',
'<h2>tapply and aggregate</h2>\n\nIn the case above, we had naturally “split” data; we had a vector of city names that led to a list of different data.frames of weather data.  Sometimes the “split” operation depends on a factor.

This is <k>exactly</k> what the <code>tapply</code> function does (but with a few bells and whistles, especially around missing values, factor levels, additional arguments and multiple grouping factors at once).\n\n<code>tapply(dat$Rating, dat$Season, mean)</code>\n\n<code>1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9 \n7.725 8.158 8.304 8.465 8.343 8.283 8.441 8.423 8.323 </code>\n\nSo using <code>tapply</code>, you can do all the above manipulation in a single line.\n\nThere are a couple of limitations of <code>tapply</code>.\n\nThe first is that getting the season out of <code>tapply</code> is quite hard.  We could do:\n\n<code>as.numeric(names(rating))</code>\n\n<code>[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code>\n\nBut that’s quite ugly, not least because it involves the conversion numeric -> string -> numeric.\n\nBetter could be to use\n\n<code>sort(unique(dat$Season))</code>\n\n<code>[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code>\n\nBut that requires knowing what is going on inside of <code>tapply</code> (that unique levels are sorted and data are returned in that order).\n\nI suspect that this approach:\n\n<code>first = function(x) x[[1]] tapply(dat$Season, dat$Season, first)</code>\n\n<code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 </code>\nis probably the most fool-proof, but it’s certainly not pretty.\n\nHowever, the returned format is extremely flexible.  If you do:\n\nThe <code>aggregate</code> function provides a simplfied interface to <code>tapply</code> that avoids this issue.  It has two interfaces: the first is similar to what we used before, but the grouping variable now must be a list or data frame:\n\n<code>aggregate(dat$Rating, dat["Season"], mean)</code>\n\n<code>  Season     x\n1      1 7.725\n2      2 8.158\n3      3 8.304\n4      4 8.465\n5      5 8.343\n6      6 8.283\n7      7 8.441\n8      8 8.423\n9      9 8.323</code>\n\n(note that <code>dat["Season"]</code> returns a one-column data frame).  The column ‘x’ is our response variable, Rating, grouped by season.  We can get its name included in the column names here by specifying the first argument as a <code>data.frame</code> too:\n\n<code>aggregate(dat["Rating"], dat["Season"], mean)</code>\n\n<code>  Season Rating\n1      1  7.725\n2      2  8.158\n3      3  8.304\n4      4  8.465\n5      5  8.343\n6      6  8.283\n7      7  8.441\n8      8  8.423\n9      9  8.323</code>\n\nThe other interface is the formula interface, that will be familiar from fitting linear models:\n\n<code>aggregate(Rating ~ Season, dat, mean)</code>\n\n<code>  Season Rating\n1      1  7.725\n2      2  8.158\n3      3  8.304\n4      4  8.465\n5      5  8.343\n6      6  8.283\n7      7  8.441\n8      8  8.423\n9      9  8.323</code>\n\nThis interface is really nice; we can get the number of votes here too.\n\n<code>aggregate(cbind(Rating, Votes) ~ Season, dat, mean)</code>\n\n<code>  Season Rating Votes\n1      1  7.725 579.0\n2      2  8.158 533.0\n3      3  8.304 496.7\n4      4  8.465 497.0\n5      5  8.343 452.5\n6      6  8.283 385.7\n7      7  8.441 408.0\n8      8  8.423 391.4\n9      9  8.323 415.0</code>\n\nIf you have multiple grouping variables, you can write things like:\n&lt;div class=\'bogus-wrapper\'>&lt;figcaption>&lt;/figcaption>&lt;div class=&#8221;highlight&#8221;>&lt;table>&lt;tr>&lt;td class=&#8221;gutter&#8221;>&lt;pre class=&#8221;line-numbers&#8221;>1\n&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;td class=\'code\'>&lt;pre><code>aggregate(response ~ factor1 + factor2, dat, function)</code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>\n\nto apply a function to each pair of levels of <code>factor1</code> and <code>factor2</code>.\n',

By default, <code>foreach</code> will append the output to a list which we\'ve saved to an object.  \nThe default method for recombining output can be changed using the <code>.combine</code> argument.  \nAlso be aware that packages used in the evaluated expression must be included with the <code>.packages</code> argument.\nThe processors should be working at full capacity if the the loop is executed properly.  \nNote the difference here compared to the first loop that was run in sequence.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://beckmw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/proc2.jpg">\nFig: Resources used during parallel processing of a <code>for</code> loop.\n\nA few other issues are worth noting when using the foreach package.  \nThese are mainly issues I\'ve encountered and I\'m sure others could contribute to this list.  \nThe foreach package does not work with all types of loops.  \nFor example, I chose the above example to use a large number (<code>1e6</code>) of observations with the <code>rnorm</code> function.  \nI can\'t say for certain the exact type of data that works best, but I have found that functions     hat take a long time when run individually are generally handled very well.  \nInterestingly, decreasing the number of observations and increasing the number of iterations may cause the processors to not run at maximum efficiency (try <code>rnorm(100)</code> with <code>1e5</code> iterations). I also haven\'t had much success running repeated models in parallel.  \nThe functions work but the processors never seem to reach max efficiency.  \nThe system statistics should cue you off as to whether or not the functions are working.\nI also find it bothersome that monitoring progress seems is an issue with parallel loops.  \nA simple call using <code>cat</code> to return the iteration in the console does not work with parallel loops.  \nThe most practical solution I\'ve found is described <a href="http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/monitoring-progress-inside-foreach-loop/" title="here">here</a>, which involves exporting information to a separate file that tells you how far the loop has progressed.  \nAlso, be very aware of your RAM when running processes in parallel.  \nI\'ve found that it\'s incredibly easy to max out the memory, which not only causes the function to stop working correctly, but also makes your computer run like garbage.  \nFinally, I\'m a little concerned that I might be destroying my processors by running them at maximum capacity.  \nThe fan always runs at full blast leading me to believe that critical meltdown is imminent.  \nI\'d be pleased to know if this is an issue or not.\nThat\'s it for now.  \nI have to give credit to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/vignettes/gettingstartedParallel.pdf" title="this tutorial">this tutorial</a> for a lot of the information in this post.  \n<h3>Vectorised</h3>\nE = sapply(1:10000, function(n) {max.eig(5, 1)})\nsummary(E)\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.\n 0.7615  1.9150  2.2610  2.3160  2.6470  5.2800\n\nHere eigenvalues are calculated from 10000 function calls, all of which use the same parameters. \nThe distribution of the resulting eigenvalues is plotted in the histogram below. \nGenerating these data took a couple of seconds on my middle-of-the-range laptop. \nNot a big wait. \nBut it was only using one of the four cores on the machine, so in principle it could have gone faster.\n\nWe can make things more interesting by varying the dimensions of the matrix.\nsapply(1:5, function(n) {max.eig(n, 1)})\n\nOr changing both the dimensions (taking on integral values between 1 and 5) and the standard deviation (running through 1, 2 and 3).\nsapply(1:5, function(n) {sapply(1:3, function(m) {max.eig(n, m)})})\n\nThe results are presented in an intuitive matrix. Everything up to this point is being done serially.\n<h3>Enter foreach</h3>\nlibrary(foreach)\n\nAt first sight, the foreach library provides a slightly different interface for vectorisation. We’ll start off with simple repetition.\ntimes(10) %do% max.eig(5, 1)\n\nThat just executes the function with the same arguments 10 times over. If we want to systematically vary the parameters, then instead of times() we use foreach().\nforeach(n = 1:5) %do% max.eig(n, 1)\n\nThe results are returned as a list, which is actually more reminiscent of the behaviour of lapply() than sapply(). But we can get something more compact by using the .combine option.\nforeach(n = 1:5, .combine = c) %do% max.eig(n, 1)\n\nThat’s better. Now, what about varying both the dimensions and standard deviation? We can string together multiple calls to foreach() using the %:% nesting operator.\nforeach(n = 1:5) %:% foreach(m = 1:3) %do% max.eig(n, m)\n\nI have omitted the output because it consists of nested lists: it’s long and somewhat ugly. But again we can use the .combine option to make it more compact.\nforeach(n = 1:5, .combine = rbind) %:% foreach(m = 1:3) %do% max.eig(n, m)\n\nforeach(n = 1:5, .combine = cbind) %:% foreach(m = 1:3) %do% max.eig(n, m)\n\nYou can choose between combining using cbind() or rbind() depending on whether you want the output from the inner loop to form the columns or rows of the output. \nThere’s lots more magic to be done with .combine. \nYou can find the details in the informative article <a href="http://r.adu.org.za/web/packages/foreach/vignettes/foreach.pdf" target="_blank">Using The foreach Package</a> by Steve Weston.\n\nYou can also use foreach() to loop over multiple variables simultaneously.\nforeach(n = 1:5, m = 1:5) %do% max.eig(n, m)\n\nBut this is still all serial…\n\n<h3>Filtering</h3>\nOne final capability before we move on to parallel execution, is the ability to add in a filter within the foreach() statement.\n\nlibrary(numbers)\nforeach(n = 1:100, .combine = c) %:% when (isPrime(n)) %do% n\n\nHere we identify the prime numbers between 1 and 100 by simply looping through the entire sequence of values and selecting only those that satisfy the condition in the when() clause. Of course, there are more efficient ways to do this, but this notation is rather neat.\n<h3>Going Parallel</h3>\nMaking the transition from serial to parallel is as simple as changing %do% to %dopar%.\nforeach(n = 1:5) %dopar% max.eig(n, 1)\n\nWarning message:\nexecuting %dopar% sequentially: no parallel backend registered\n\nThe warning gives us pause for thought: maybe it was not quite that simple? Yes, indeed, there are additional requirements. You need first to choose a parallel backend. And here, again, there are a few options. We will start with the most accessible, which is the multicore backend.\n<h3>Multicore</h3>\nMulticore processing is provided by the doMC library. You need to load the library and tell it how many cores you want to use.\nlibrary(doMC)\nregisterDoMC(cores=4)\n\nLet’s make a comparison between serial and parallel execution times.\n\nlibrary(rbenchmark)\n\nbenchmark(\n+     foreach(n = 1:50) %do% max.eig(n, 1),\n+     foreach(n = 1:50) %dopar% max.eig(n, 1)\n+ )\n\nThe overall execution time is reduced, but not by the factor of 4 that one might expect. \nThis is due to the additional burden of having to distribute the job over the multiple cores. \nThe tradeoff between communication and computation is one of the major limitations of parallel computing, but if computations are lengthy and there is not too much data to move around then the gains can be excellent.\n\nOn a single machine you are limited by the number of cores. But if you have access to a cluster then you can truly take things to another level.\n<h3>Cluster</h3>\nThe foreach() functionality can be applied to a cluster using the doSNOW library. We will start by using doSNOW to create a collection of R instances on a single machine using a SOCK cluster.\n\nlibrary(doSNOW)\ncluster = makeCluster(4, type = "SOCK")\nregisterDoSNOW(cluster)\n\nbenchmark(\n+     foreach(n = 1:50) %do% max.eig(n, 1),\n+     foreach(n = 1:50) %dopar% max.eig(n, 1)\n+ )\n\nstopCluster(cluster)\n\nThere is an improvement in execution time which is roughly comparable to what we got with the multicore implementation. Note that when you are done, you need to shut down the cluster.\n\nNext we will create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface" target="_blank">MPI</a> cluster consisting of 20 threads.\ncluster = makeCluster(20, type = "MPI")\n#\nregisterDoSNOW(cluster)\n#\nbenchmark(\n+     foreach(n = 1:100) %do% max.eig(n, 1),\n+     foreach(n = 1:100) %dopar% max.eig(n, 1)\n+ )\n\nThere is an improvement in performance, with the parallel job running roughly 3 times as quickly.\n\nHow about a slightly more complicated example? We will try running some bootstrap calculations. We start out with the serial implementation.\nrandom.data = matrix(rnorm(1000000), ncol = 1000)\n\nbmed = function(d, n) median(d[n])\n\nlibrary(boot)\n#\nsapply(1:100, function(n) {sd(boot(random.data[, n], bmed, R = 10000)$t)})\n\nFirst we generated a big array of normally distributed random numbers. Then we used sapply to calculate bootstrap estimates for the standard deviation of the median for each columns of the matrix.\n\nThe parallel implementation requires a little more work: first we need to make the global data (the random matrix and the bootstrap function) available across the cluster.\nclusterExport(cluster, c("random.data", "bmed"))\n\nThen we spread the jobs out over the cluster nodes. We will do this first using clusterApply(), which is part of the snow library and is the cluster analogue of sapply(). It returns a list, so to get a nice compact representation we use unlist().\nresults = clusterApply(cluster, 1:100, function(n) {\n+     library(boot)\n+     sd(boot(random.data[, n], bmed, R = 10000)$t)\n+ })\nhead(unlist(results))\n\nThe foreach implementation is a little neater.\nresults = foreach(n = 1:100, .combine = c) %dopar% {\n    library(boot); sd(boot(random.data[, n], bmed, R = 10000)$t)\n}\nhead(results)\n\nstopCluster(cluster)\n\nThe key in both cases is that the boot library must be loaded on each of the cluster nodes as well so that its functionality is available. Simply loading the library on the root node is not enough!\n',

'<h2>What Is a Formula in R?</h2>\nFormula allow you to capture two things:\n\nAn unevaluated expression\nThe context or environment in which the expression was created\n\nIn R the tilde operator ~ characterizes formulas With this operator, you say: "capture the meaning of this code, without evaluating it" You can think of a formula in R as a "quoting" operator\n\n<code># A formula\nd = y ~ x + b</code>\n\nThe variable on the left-hand side of a tilde (~) is called the "dependent variable", while the variables on the right-hand side are called the "independent variables" and are joined by plus signs +.\n\nYou can access the elements of a formula with the help of the square brackets: [[and ]].\n\n<code>f = y ~ x + b \n# Retrieve the elements at index 1 and 2\nf[[1]] ## "~"\nf[[2]] ## y\nf[[3]] ## x + b</code>\n\n<h3>Why Use Formulae in R?</h3>\nFormulas are powerful, general-purpose tools that allow you to capture the values of variables without evaluating them so that they can be interpreted by the function\n\nAlso, you use these R objects to express a relationship between variables.\n\nFor example, in the first line of code in the code chunk below, you say "y is a function of x, a, and b"\n\n<code>y ~ x + a + b\n## y ~ x + a + b</code>\n\nMore complex formulas like the code chunk below:\n\n<code>Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width | Species\n## Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width | Species</code>\n\nWhere you mean to say "the sepal width is a function of petal width, conditioned on species"\n\n<h3>Using Formulas in R</h3>',
'<h2>How To Create a Formula in R</h2>\n1.With the help of ~ operator 2.Some times you need or want to create a formula from an R object, such as a string. In such cases, you can use the formula or as.formula() function\n\n<code>"y ~ x1 + x2"\n## [1] "y ~ x1 + x2"\nh = as.formula("y ~ x1 + x2")\nh = formula("y ~ x1 + x2")</code>\n',
'<h2>How To Concatenate Formulae</h2>\nTo glue or bring multiple formulas together, you have two option:\n\nCreate separate variables for each formula and then use list()\n\n<code># Create variables\ni = y ~ x\nj = y ~ x + x1\nk = y ~ x + x1 + x2\n\n# Concatentate\nformulae = list(as.formula(i),as.formula(j),as.formula(k))</code>\n\nUse the lapply() function, where you pass in a vector with all of your formulas as a first argument and as.formula as the function that you want to apply to each element of that vector\n\n<code># Join all with "c()"\nl = c(i, j, k)\n\n# Apply "as.formula" to all elements of "f"\nlapply(l, as.formula)\n[[1]] ## y ~ x\n[[2]] ## y ~ x + x1\n[[3]] ## y ~ x + x1 + x2</code>\n\n<h3>Formula Operators</h3>\n"+" for joining\n"-" for removing terms\n":" for interaction\n"*" for crossing\n"%in%" for nesting\n"^" for limit crossing to the specified degree\n\n<code># Use multiple independent variables\ny ~ x1 + x2 ## y ~ x1 + x2\n# Ignore objects in an analysis\ny ~ x1 - x2 ## y ~ x1 - x2</code>\n\nWhat if you want to actually perform an arithmetic operation? you have a couple of solutions:\n\n1.You can calculate and store all of the variables in advance 2.You use the I() or "as-is" operator: y ~ x + I(x^2)\n\n<h3>How To Inspect Formulas in R</h3>\nYou saw functions such as attributes(), typeof(), class(), etc\n\nTo examine and compare different formulae, you can use the terms() function:\n\n<code>m = formula("y ~ x1 + x2")\nterms(m)\n## y ~ x1 + x2\n## attr(,"variables")\n## list(y, x1, x2)\n## attr(,"factors")\n##    x1 x2\n## y   0  0\n## x1  1  0\n## x2  0  1\n## attr(,"term.labels")\n## [1] "x1" "x2"\n## attr(,"order")\n## [1] 1 1\n## attr(,"intercept")\n## [1] 1\n## attr(,"response")\n## [1] 1\n## attr(,".Environment")\n## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nclass(m)\n## [1] "formula"\ntypeof(m)\n## [1] "language"\nattributes(m)\n## $class\n## [1] "formula"\n## \n## $.Environment\n## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv></code>\n\nIf you want to know the names of the variables in the model, you can use all.vars.\n\n<code>print(all.vars(m))\n## [1] "y"  "x1" "x2"</code>\n\nTo modify formulae without converting them to character you can use the update() function:\n\n<code>update(y ~ x1 + x2, ~. + x3)\n## y ~ x1 + x2 + x3\ny ~ x1 + x2 + x3\n## y ~ x1 + x2 + x3</code>\n\nDouble check whether you variable is a formula by passing it to the is.formula() function.\n\n<code># Load "plyr"\nlibrary(plyr)\n\n# Check "m"\nis.formula(m)\n## [1] TRUE</code>\n\n<h3>When To Use Formulas</h3>\n1.Modeling Functions\n2.Graphical Functions in R\n\n<h3>R Formula Packages</h3>\n1.Formula Package\n2.formula.tools\n',

'<h2>Customizing Startup the R environment</h2>\nR will always source the Rprofile.site file first. \nOn Windows, the file is in the C:/Program Files/R/R-n.n.n/etc directory. \n\nYou can also place a .Rprofile file in any directory that you are going to run R from or in the user home directory.\n\nAt startup, R will source the Rprofile.site file. \nIt will then look for a .Rprofile file to source in the current working directory. \nIf it doesn\'t find it, it will look for one in the user\'s home directory. \n\nThere are two special functions you can place in these files. \n.First( ) will be run at the start of the R session and .Last( ) will be run at the end of the session.\n\n# Sample Rprofile.site file\n\n# Things you might want to change\n# options(papersize="a4")\n# options(editor="notepad")\n# options(pager="internal")\n\n# R interactive prompt\n# options(prompt="> ")\n# options(continue="+ ")\n\n# to prefer Compiled HTML\nhelp options(chmhelp=TRUE)\n# to prefer HTML help\n# options(htmlhelp=TRUE)\n\n# General options\noptions(tab.width = 2)\noptions(width = 130)\noptions(graphics.record=TRUE)\n\n.First = function(){\n library(Hmisc)\n library(R2HTML)\n cat("/nWelcome at", date(), "/n")\n}\n\n.Last = function(){\n cat("/nGoodbye at ", date(), "/n")\n}\n',
'<h2>Managing R</h2>\nwith .Rprofile, .Renviron, Rprofile.site, Renviron.site, rsession.conf, and repos.conf\nUpon startup, R and RStudio look for a few different files you can use to control the behavior of your R session, for example by setting options or environment variables. \nIn the context of RStudio Team, these settings are often used to set RStudio Server Pro to search for packages in an RStudio Package Manager repository.\n\nThis article is a practical guide to how to set particular options on R startup. \nGeneral information on how to manage R package environments is available at <a href="https://environments.rstudio.com" target="_blank">environments.rstudio.com</a> , and a deeper treatment of R process startup is available in <a href="https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/19/r-for-enterprise-understanding-r-s-startup/" target="_blank">this article</a>.&nbsp;\n\nHere is a summary table of how to control R options and environment variables on startup. \nMore details are below.\n\n<table border="black">\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>File</td><td>Who Controls</td><td>Level</td><td>Limitations</td></tr>\n<tr><td><code>.Rprofile</code></td><td>User or Admin</td><td>User or Project</td><td>None, sourced as R code.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><code>.Renviron</code></td><td>User or Admin</td><td>User or Project</td><td>Set environment variables only.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><code>Rprofile.site</code></td><td>Admin</td><td>Version of R</td><td>None, sourced as R code.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><code>Renviron.site</code></td><td>Admin</td><td>Version of R</td><td>Set environment variables only.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><code>rsession.conf</code></td><td>Admin</td><td>Server</td><td>Only RStudio settings, only single repository.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><code>repos.conf</code></td><td>Admin</td><td>Server</td><td>Only for setting repositories.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><code>.Rprofile</code></h3>\n<code>.Rprofile</code> files are user-controllable files to set options and environment variables. \n<code>.Rprofile</code> files can be either at the user or project level. \nUser-level <code>.Rprofile</code> files live in the base of the user\'s home directory, and project-level <code>.Rprofile</code> files live in the base of the project directory.&nbsp;\n\nR will source only one <code>.Rprofile</code> file. \nSo if you have both a project-specific <code>.Rprofile</code> file and a user <code>.Rprofile</code> file that you want to use, you explicitly source the user-level <code>.Rprofile</code> at the top of your project-level <code>.Rprofile</code> with <code>source("~/.Rprofile")</code>.\n\n<code>.Rprofile</code> files are sourced as regular R code, so setting environment variables must be done inside a <code>Sys.setenv(key = "value")</code> call.&nbsp;\n\nOne easy way to edit your <code>.RProfile</code> file is to use the <code>usethis::edit_r_profile()</code> function from within an R session. \nYou can specify whether you want to edit the user or project level <code>.Rprofile.</code>\n\n<h3><code>.Renviron</code></h3>\n<code>.Renviron</code> is a user-controllable file that can be used to create environment variables. \nThis is especially useful to avoid including credentials like API keys inside R scripts. \nThis file is written in a key-value format, so environment variables are created in the format:\n\nKey1=value1\nKey2=value2\n...\n\nAnd then <code>Sys.getenv("Key1")</code> will return <code>"value1"</code> in an R session.\n\nLike with the <code>.Rprofile</code> file, <code>.Renviron</code> files can be at either the user or project level. \nIf there is a project-level <code>.Renviron</code>, the user-level file will not be sourced. \nThe <code>usethis</code> package includes a helper function for editing <code>.Renviron</code> files from an R session with <code>usethis::edit_r_environ()</code>.\n\n<h3><code>Rprofile.site</code> and <code>Renviron.site</code></h3>\nBoth <code>.Rprofile</code> and <code>.Renviron</code> files have equivalents that apply server wide. \n<code>Rprofile.site</code>&nbsp;and<code>Renviron.site</code> (no leading dot) files are managed by admins on RStudio Server and are specific to a particular version of R.&nbsp;The most common settings for these&nbsp;files involve access to package repositories. \nFor example, using the <a href="https://environments.rstudio.com/shared.html" target="_blank">shared-baseline</a> package management strategy is generally done from an <code>Rprofile.site</code>.\n\nUsers can override settings in these files&nbsp;with their individual <code>.Rprofile</code>&nbsp;files.\n\nThese files are set for each version of R and should be located in <code>R_HOME/etc/</code>. \nYou can find<code>R_HOME</code> by running the command&nbsp;<code>R.home(component\n  = "home")</code> in a session of that version of R. \nSo, for example, if you find that <code>R_HOME</code> is <code>/opt/R/3.6.2/lib/R</code>, the<code>Rprofile.site</code> for R 3.6.2 would go in <code>/opt/R/3.6.2/lib/R/etc/Rprofile.site</code>.\n\n<h3><code>rsession.conf</code> and <code>repos.conf</code></h3>\nRStudio Server allows server admins to configure particular server-wide R package repositories via the <code>rsession.conf</code> and <code>repos.conf</code> files. \nOnly one repository can be configured in <code>rsession.conf</code>. \nIf multiple repositories are needed, <code>repos.conf</code> should be used. \nDetails on configuring RStudio Server with these files are in this <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009863114-Configuring-RStudio-Server-to-use-RStudio-Package-Manager" target="_blank">support article</a>.\n',
'<h2>R startup mechanism is as follows</h2>\nUnless --no-environ was given on the command line, R searches for site and user files to process for setting environment variables. \nThe name of the site file is the one pointed to by the environment variable R_ENVIRON; if this is unset, ‘R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site’ is used (if it exists, which it does not in a ‘factory-fresh’ installation). \nThe name of the user file can be specified by the R_ENVIRON_USER environment variable; if this is unset, the files searched for are ‘.Renviron’ in the current or in the user\'s home directory (in that order). \nSee ‘Details’ for how the files are read.\n\nThen R searches for the site-wide startup profile file of R code unless the command line option --no-site-file was given. \nThe path of this file is taken from the value of the R_PROFILE environment variable (after tilde expansion). \nIf this variable is unset, the default is ‘R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site’, which is used if it exists (it contains settings from the installer in a ‘factory-fresh’ installation). \nThis code is sourced into the base package. \nUsers need to be careful not to unintentionally overwrite objects in base, and it is normally advisable to use local if code needs to be executed: see the examples.\n\nThen, unless --no-init-file was given, R searches for a user profile, a file of R code. \nThe path of this file can be specified by the R_PROFILE_USER environment variable (and tilde expansion will be performed). \nIf this is unset, a file called ‘.Rprofile’ is searched for in the current directory or in the user\'s home directory (in that order). \nThe user profile file is sourced into the workspace.\n\nNote that when the site and user profile files are sourced only the base package is loaded, so objects in other packages need to be referred to by e.g. utils::dump.frames or after explicitly loading the package concerned.\n\nR then loads a saved image of the user workspace from ‘.RData’ in the current directory if there is one (unless --no-restore-data or --no-restore was specified on the command line).\n\nNext, if a function .First is found on the search path, it is executed as .First(). \nFinally, function .First.sys() in the base package is run. \nThis calls require to attach the default packages specified by options("defaultPackages"). \nIf the methods package is included, this will have been attached earlier (by function .OptRequireMethods()) so that namespace initializations such as those from the user workspace will proceed correctly.\n\nA function .First (and .Last) can be defined in appropriate ‘.Rprofile’ or ‘Rprofile.site’ files or have been saved in ‘.RData’. \nIf you want a different set of packages than the default ones when you start, insert a call to options in the ‘.Rprofile’ or ‘Rprofile.site’ file. \nFor example, options(defaultPackages = character()) will attach no extra packages on startup (only the base package) (or set R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL as an environment variable before running R). \nUsing options(defaultPackages = "") or R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES="" enforces the R system default.\n\nOn front-ends which support it, the commands history is read from the file specified by the environment variable R_HISTFILE (default ‘.Rhistory’ in the current directory) unless --no-restore-history or --no-restore was specified.\n\nThe command-line option --vanilla implies --no-site-file, --no-init-file, --no-environ and (except for R CMD) --no-restore Under Windows, it also implies --no-Rconsole, which prevents loading the ‘Rconsole’ file.\n\nDetails\nNote that there are two sorts of files used in startup: environment files which contain lists of environment variables to be set, and profile files which contain R code.\n\nLines in a site or user environment file should be either comment lines starting with #, or lines of the form name=value. \nThe latter sets the environmental variable name to value, overriding an existing value. \nIf value contains an expression of the form ${foo-bar}, the value is that of the environmental variable foo if that exists and is set to a non-empty value, otherwise bar. \n(If it is of the form ${foo}, the default is "".) This construction can be nested, so bar can be of the same form (as in ${foo-${bar-blah}}). \nNote that the braces are essential: for example $HOME will not be interpreted.\n\nLeading and trailing white space in value are stripped. \nvalue is then processed in a similar way to a Unix shell: in particular the outermost level of (single or double) quotes is stripped, and backslashes are removed except inside quotes.\n\nOn systems with sub-architectures (mainly Windows), the files ‘Renviron.site’ and ‘Rprofile.site’ are looked for first in architecture-specific directories, e.g. ‘R_HOME/etc/i386/Renviron.site’. \nAnd e.g. ‘.Renviron.i386’ will be used in preference to ‘.Renviron’.\n\nNote\nIt is not intended that there be interaction with the user during startup code. \nAttempting to do so can crash the R process.\n\nThe startup options are for Rgui, Rterm and R but not for Rcmd: attempting to use e.g. --vanilla with the latter will give a warning or error.\n\nUnix versions of R have a file ‘R_HOME/etc/Renviron’ which is read very early in the start-up processing. \nIt contains environment variables set by R in the configure process, and is not used on R for Windows.\n\nR CMD check and R CMD build do not always read the standard startup files, but they do always read specific Renviron files. \nThe location of these can be controlled by the environment variables R_CHECK_ENVIRON and R_BUILD_ENVIRON. \nIf these are set their value is used as the path for the Renviron file; otherwise, files ‘~/.R/check.Renviron’ or ‘~/.R/build.Renviron’ or sub-architecture-specific versions are employed.\n\nIf you want ‘~/.Renviron’ or ‘~/.Rprofile’ to be ignored by child R processes (such as those run by R CMD check and R CMD build), set the appropriate environment variable R_ENVIRON_USER or R_PROFILE_USER to (if possible, which it is not on Windows) "" or to the name of a non-existent file.\n\nSee Also\nFor the definition of the ‘home’ directory on Windows see the ‘rw-FAQ’ Q2.14. \nIt can be found from a running R by Sys.getenv("R_USER").\n\n.Last for final actions at the close of an R session. \ncommandArgs for accessing the command line arguments.\n\nThere are examples of using startup files to set defaults for graphics devices in the help for windows.options.\n\nAn Introduction to R for more command-line options: those affecting memory management are covered in the help file for Memory.\n\nreadRenviron to read ‘.Renviron’ files.\n\nFor profiling code, see Rprof.\n\nExamples\n## Not run: \n## Example ~/.Renviron on Unix\nR_LIBS=~/R/library\nPAGER=/usr/local/bin/less\n\n## Example .Renviron on Windows\nR_LIBS=C:/R/library\nMY_TCLTK="c:/Program Files/Tcl/bin"\n\n## Example of setting R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES (from R CMD check)\nR_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=\'utils,grDevices,graphics,stats\'\n# this loads the packages in the order given, so they appear on\n# the search path in reverse order.\n\n## Example of .Rprofile\noptions(width=65, digits=5)\noptions(show.signif.stars=FALSE)\nsetHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),\n        function(...) grDevices::ps.options(horizontal=FALSE))\nset.seed(1234)\n.First = function() cat("/n   Welcome to R!/n/n")\n.Last = function()  cat("/n   Goodbye!/n/n")\n\n## Example of Rprofile.site\nlocal({\n  # add MASS to the default packages, set a CRAN mirror\n  old = getOption("defaultPackages"); r = getOption("repos")\n  r["CRAN"] = "http://my.local.cran"\n  options(defaultPackages = c(old, "MASS"), repos = r)\n  ## (for Unix terminal users) set the width from COLUMNS if set\n  cols = Sys.getenv("COLUMNS")\n  if(nzchar(cols)) options(width = as.integer(cols))\n  # interactive sessions get a fortune cookie (needs fortunes package)\n  if (interactive())\n    fortunes::fortune()\n})\n\n## if .Renviron contains\nFOOBAR="coo/bar"doh/ex"abc/"def\'"\n\n## then we get\n# > cat(Sys.getenv("FOOBAR"), "/n")\n# coo/bardoh/exabc"def\'\n\n## End(Not run)\n',

'<h2>Introduction to V8 for R</h2>\nV8 is Google’s open source, high performance JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, 5th edition. The V8 R package builds on the C++ library to provide a completely standalone JavaScript engine within R:\n\n<code># Create a new context\nct = v8()\n\n# Evaluate some code\nct$eval("var foo = 123")\nct$eval("var bar = 456")\nct$eval("foo + bar")</code>\n\n<code>[1] "579"</code>\n\nA major advantage over the other foreign language interfaces is that V8 requires no compilers, external executables or other run-time dependencies. The entire engine is contained within a 6MB package (2MB zipped) and works on all major platforms.\n\n<code># Create some JSON\ncat(ct$eval("JSON.stringify({x:Math.random()})"))</code>\n\n<code>{"x":0.5580623043314792}</code>\n\n<code># Simple closure\nct$eval("(function(x){return x+1;})(123)")</code>\n\n<code>[1] "124"</code>\n\nHowever note that V8 by itself is just the naked JavaScript engine. Currently, there is no DOM (i.e. no <em>window</em> object), no network or disk IO, not even an event loop. Which is fine because we already have all of those in R. In this sense V8 resembles other foreign language interfaces such as Rcpp or rJava, but then for JavaScript.\n\n<h3>Loading JavaScript Libraries</h3>\nThe <code>ct$source</code> method is a convenience function for loading JavaScript libraries from a file or url.\n\n<code>ct$source(system.file("js/underscore.js", package="V8"))\nct$source("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crossfilter/1.3.11/crossfilter.min.js")</code>\n\n<h3>Data Interchange</h3>\nBy default all data interchange between R and JavaScript happens via JSON using the bidirectional mapping implemented in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2805">jsonlite</a> package.\n\n<code>ct$assign("mydata", mtcars)\nct$get("mydata")</code>\n\n<code>                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4           21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag       21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710          22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\n...\nVolvo 142E          21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4    2</code>\n\nAlternatively use <code>JS()</code> to assign the value of a JavaScript expression (without converting to JSON):\n\n<code>ct$assign("foo", JS("function(x){return x*x}"))\nct$assign("bar", JS("foo(9)"))\nct$get("bar")</code>\n\n<code>[1] 81</code>\n\n<h3>Function Calls</h3>\nThe <code>ct$call</code> method calls a JavaScript function, automatically converting objects (arguments and return value) between R and JavaScript:\n\n<code>ct$call("_.filter", mtcars, JS("function(x){return x.mpg &lt; 15}"))</code>\n\n<code>                     mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nDuster 360          14.3   8  360 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8  472 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8  460 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8  440 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8  350 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4</code>\n\nIt looks a bit like <code>.Call</code> but then for JavaScript instead of C.\n\n<h3>Interactive JavaScript Console</h3>\nA fun way to learn JavaScript or debug a session is by entering the interactive console:\n\n<code># Load some data\ndata(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")\nct$assign("diamonds", diamonds)\nct$console()</code>\n\nFrom here you can interactively work in JavaScript without typing <code>ct$eval</code> every time:\n\n<code>var cf = crossfilter(diamonds)\nvar price = cf.dimension(function(x){return x.price})\nvar depth = cf.dimension(function(x){return x.depth})\nprice.filter([2000, 3000])\noutput = depth.top(10)</code>\n\nTo exit the console, either press <code>ESC</code> or type <code>exit</code>. Afterwards you can retrieve the objects back into R:\n\n<code>output = ct$get("output")\nprint(output)</code>\n\n<h3>warnings, errors and console.log</h3>\nEvaluating invalid JavaScript code results in a SyntaxError:\n\n<code># A common typo\nct$eval(\'var foo = 123;\')</code>\n\n<code>Error in context_eval(join(src), private$context, serialize): SyntaxError: Unexpected token \'&lt;\'</code>\n\nJavaScript runtime exceptions are automatically propagated into R errors:\n\n<code># Runtime errors\nct$eval("123 + doesnotexit")</code>\n\n<code>Error in context_eval(join(src), private$context, serialize): ReferenceError: doesnotexit is not defined</code>\n\nWithin JavaScript we can also call back to the R console manually using <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.warn</code> and <code>console.error</code>. This allows for explicitly generating output, warnings or errors from within a JavaScript application.\n\n<code>ct$eval(\'console.log("this is a message")\')</code>\n\n<code>this is a message</code>\n\n<code>ct$eval(\'console.warn("Heads up!")\')</code>\n\n<code>Warning: Heads up!</code>\n\n<code>ct$eval(\'console.error("Oh no! An error!")\')</code>\n\n<code>Error in context_eval(join(src), private$context, serialize): Oh no! An error!</code>\n\nA example of using <code>console.error</code> is to verify that external resources were loaded:\n\n<code>ct = v8()\nct$source("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crossfilter/1.3.11/crossfilter.min.js")\nct$eval(\'var cf = crossfilter || console.error("failed to load crossfilter!")\')</code>\n\n<h3>The Global Namespace</h3>\nUnlike what you might be used to from Node or your browser, the global namespace for a new context if very minimal. By default it contains only a few objects: <code>global</code> (a reference to itself), <code>console</code> (for <code>console.log</code> and friends) and <code>print</code> (an alias of console.log needed by some JavaScript libraries)\n\n<code>ct = v8(typed_arrays = FALSE);\nct$get(JS("Object.keys(global)"))</code>\n\n<code>[1] "print"   "console" "global" </code>\n\nIf typed arrays are enabled it contains some additional functions:\n\n<code>ct = v8(typed_arrays = TRUE);\nct$get(JS("Object.keys(global)"))</code>\n\n<code>[1] "print"   "console" "global" </code>\n\nA context always has a global scope, even when no name is set. When a context is initiated with <code>global = NULL</code>, it can still be reached by evaluating the <code>this</code> keyword within the global scope:\n\n<code>ct2 = v8(global = NULL, console = FALSE)\nct2$get(JS("Object.keys(this).length"))</code>\n\n<code>[1] 1</code>\n\n<code>ct2$assign("cars", cars)\nct2$eval("var foo = 123")\nct2$eval("function test(x){x+1}")\nct2$get(JS("Object.keys(this).length"))</code>\n\n<code>[1] 4</code>\n\n<code>ct2$get(JS("Object.keys(this)"))</code>\n\n<code>[1] "print" "cars"  "foo"   "test" </code>\n\nTo create your own global you could use something like:\n\n<code>ct2$eval("var __global__ = this")\nct2$eval("(function(){var bar = [1,2,3,4]; __global__.bar = bar; })()")\nct2$get("bar")</code>\n\n<code>[1] 1 2 3 4</code>\n\n<h3>Syntax Validation</h3>\nV8 also allows for validating JavaScript syntax, without actually evaluating it.\n\n<code>ct$validate("function foo(x){2*x}")</code>\n\n<code>[1] TRUE</code>\n\n<code>ct$validate("foo = function(x){2*x}")</code>\n\n<code>[1] TRUE</code>\n\nThis might be useful for all those R libraries that generate browser graphics via templated JavaScript. Note that JavaScript does not allow for defining anonymous functions in the global scope:\n\n<code>ct$validate("function(x){2*x}")</code>\n\n<code>[1] FALSE</code>\n\nTo check if an anonymous function is syntactically valid, prefix it with <code>!</code> or wrap in <code>()</code>. These are OK:\n\n<code>ct$validate("(function(x){2*x})")</code>\n\n<code>[1] TRUE</code>\n\n<code>ct$validate("!function(x){2*x}")</code>\n\n<code>[1] TRUE</code>\n\n<h3>Callback To R</h3>\nA recently added feature is to interact with R from within JavaScript using the <code>console.r</code> API\n. This is most easily demonstrated via the interactive console.\n\n<code>ctx = v8()\nctx$console()</code>\n\nFrom JavaScript we can read/write R objects via <code>console.r.get</code> and <code>console.r.assign</code>. The final argument is an optional list specifying arguments passed to <code>toJSON</code> or <code>fromJSON</code>.\n\n<code>// read the iris object into JS\nvar iris = console.r.get("iris")\nvar iris_col = console.r.get("iris", {dataframe : "col"})\n\n//write an object back to the R session\nconsole.r.assign("iris2", iris)\nconsole.r.assign("iris3", iris, {simplifyVector : false})</code>\n\nTo call R functions use <code>console.r.call</code>. The first argument should be a string which evaluates to a function. The second argument contains a list of arguments passed to the function, similar to <code>do.call</code> in R. Both named and unnamed lists are supported. The return object is returned to JavaScript via JSON.\n\n<code>//calls rnorm(n=2, mean=10, sd=5)\nvar out = console.r.call(\'rnorm\', {n: 2,mean:10, sd:5})\nvar out = console.r.call(\'rnorm\', [2, 20, 5])\n\n//anonymous function\nvar out = console.r.call(\'function(x){x^2}\', {x:12})</code>\n\nThere is also an <code>console.r.eval</code> function, which evaluates some code. It takes only a single argument (the string to evaluate) and does not return anything. Output is printed to the console.\n\n<code>console.r.eval(\'sessionInfo()\')</code>\n\nBesides automatically converting objects, V8 also propagates exceptions between R, C++ and JavaScript up and down the stack. Hence you can catch R errors as JavaScript exceptions when calling an R function from JavaScript or vice versa. If nothing gets caught, exceptions bubble all the way up as R errors in your top-level R session.\n\n<code>//raise an error in R\nconsole.r.call(\'stop("ouch!")\')\n\n//catch error from JavaScript\ntry {\n  console.r.call(\'stop("ouch!")\')\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log("Uhoh R had an error: " + e)\n}\n//# Uhoh R had an error: ouch!</code>\n',
'<h2>sprintf Function</h2>\n<k>Basic R Syntax of sprintf:</k>\nsprintf("%f", x)\n\n<k>Definition of sprintf:</k>\n\nThe sprintf function returns character objects containing a formatted combination of input values.\n\n<h3>Example 1: Format Decimal Places with sprintf Function in R</h3>\nx = 123.456               # Create example data\n\nThe default number of decimal places is six digits after the decimal point\n\nsprintf("%f", x)           # sprintf with default specification\n#  "123.456000"\n\nWe can control the number of decimal places by adding a point and a number between the percentage sign and the f. \nFor instance, we can print ten digits after the decimal point…\n\nsprintf("%.10f", x)        # sprintf with ten decimal places\n# "123.4560000000"\n\n…or we can round our numeric input value to only two digits after the decimal point:\n\nsprintf("%.2f", x)         # sprintf with two rounded decimal places\n# "123.46"\n\n<k>Note:</k> The output of sprintf is a <a href="http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/basic-data-types/character" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">character string</a> and not a numeric value as the input was.\n\n<h3>Example 2: Format Places Before Decimal Point</h3>\nsprintf also enables the formatting of the number of digits before the decimal separator. \nWe can tell sprintf to print all digits before the decimal point, but no digits after the decimal point…\n\nsprintf("%1.0f", x)        # sprintf without decimal places\n# "123"\n\n…or we can print a certain amount of leading blanks before our number without decimal places (as illustrated by the quotes below)…\n\nsprintf("%10.0f", x)       # sprintf with space before number\n# "       123"\n\n…or with decimal places…\n\nsprintf("%10.1f", x)       # Space before number & decimal places\n# "     123.5"\n\n…or we can print blanks at the right side of our output by writing a minus sign in front of the number within the sprintf function:\n\nsprintf("%-15f", x)        # Space on right side\n# "123.456000     "\n\n<h3>Example 3: Print Non-Numeric Values with sprintf (e.g. + or %)</h3>\nIt is also possible to combine numeric with non-numeric inputs. \nThe following R code returns a plus sign in front of our example number…\n\nsprintf("%+f", x)          # Print plus sign before number\n# "+123.456000"\n\n…and the following R code prints a percentage sign at the end of our number:\n\npaste0(sprintf("%f", x),   # Print %-sign at the end of number\n       "%")\n# "123.456000%"\n\n<h3>Example 4: Control Scientific Notation</h3>\nThe sprintf R function is also used to <a href="https://statisticsglobe.com/disable-exponential-scientific-notation-in-r">control exponential notation in R</a>. \nThe following syntax returns our number as scientific notation with a lower case e…\n\nsprintf("%e", x)           # Exponential notation\n# "1.234560e+02"\n\n…and the following code returns an upper case E to the RStudio console:\n\nsprintf("%E", x)           # Exponential with upper case E\n# "1.234560e+02"\n\n<h3>Example 5: Control Amount of Decimal Zeros</h3>\nWe can also control the amount of decimal zeros that we want to print to the RStudio console. \nThe following R code prints our example number without any decimal zeros…\n\nsprintf("%g", x)           # sprintf without decimal zeros\n# "123.456"\n\n…the following R code returns our example number * 1e10 in scientific notation…\n\nsprintf("%g", 1e10 * x)    # Scientific notation\n# "1.23456e+12"\n\n…and by adding a number before the g within the sprintf function we can control the amount of decimal zeros that we want to print:\n\nsprintf("%.13g", 1e10 * x) # Fixed decimal zeros\n# "1234560000000"\n\n<h3>Example 6: Several Input Values for sprintf Function</h3>\nSo far, we have only used a single numeric value (i.e. our example data object x) as input for sprintf. \nHowever, the sprintf command allows as many input values as we want.\n\nFurthermore, we can print these input values within more complex character strings. \nHave a look at the following sprintf example:\n\nsprintf("Let\'s create %1.0f more complex example %1.0f you.", 1, 4)\n# "Let\'s create 1 more complex example 4 you."\n\nThe first specification (i.e. %1.0f) within the previous R code corresponds to the input value 1 and the second specification corresponds to the input value 4.\n\nOf cause we could use sprintf in even more complex settings. \nHave a look at the sprintf examples of the R help documentation, if you are interested in more complex examples:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://statisticsglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sprintf-r-help-documentation-more-sophisticated-examples.png">\n\n<em><k>Figure 1: Complex sprintf Examples in R Help Documentation.</k></em>\n\nExamples\n## be careful with the format: most things in R are floats\n## only integer-valued reals get coerced to integer.\n\nsprintf("%s is %f feet tall/n", "Sven", 7.1)      # OK\ntry(sprintf("%s is %i feet tall/n", "Sven", 7.1)) # not OK\ntry(sprintf("%s is %i feet tall/n", "Sven", 7))   # OK\n\n## use a literal % :\nsprintf("%.0f%% said yes (out of a sample of size %.0f)", 66.666, 3)\n\n## no truncation:\nsprintf("%1.f",101)\n## re-use one argument three times, show difference between %x and %X\nxx = sprintf("%1$d %1$x %1$X", 0:15)\nxx = matrix(xx, dimnames=list(rep("", 16), "%d%x%X"))\nnoquote(format(xx, justify="right"))\n\n## More sophisticated:\n\nsprintf("min 10-char string \'%10s\'",\n        c("a", "ABC", "and an even longer one"))\n\nn = 1:18\nsprintf(paste("e with %2d digits = %.",n,"g",sep=""), n, exp(1))\n\n## Using arguments out of order\nsprintf("second %2$1.0f, first %1$5.2f, third %3$1.0f", pi, 2, 3)\n\n## Using asterisk for width or precision\nsprintf("precision %.*f, width \'%*.3f\'", 3, pi, 8, pi)\n\n## Asterisk and argument re-use, \'e\' example reiterated:\nsprintf("e with %1$2d digits = %2$.*1$g", n, exp(1))\n\n## re-cycle arguments \nsprintf("%s %d", "test", 1:3)\n\nsprintf(fmt, …)\nCreate a character string that contains values from R objects. \n\nfmt – A character string with some occurrences of %s, which will be places that object values are inserted.\n… – The R objects to be inserted. \nThe number of items should correspond to the number of %s occurrences in fmt.\n\nExample. \nx = 2349\nsprintf("Substitute in a string or number: %s", x)\n"Substitute in a string or number: 2349"\n\nsprintf("Can have multiple %s occurrences %s", x, "- got it?")\n"Can have multiple 2349 occurrences - got it?"\n\nCreating Custom Themes for RStudio\n<a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes" class="whitebut ">rsthemes</a>\n\nCreating an rstheme\nAnother straightforward method would be to copy an existing rstheme and then modify the values.\n\nBecause of the structure of the elements being styled, not all the CSS rule sets may end up being used. \nBelow is a table that describes the most relevant selectors, which tmTheme scope they correspond to, if any, and how they impact the style of RStudio.\n\nSelector	Scope	Description\n.ace_bracket		Overrides default styling for matching bracket highlighting provided by Ace.\n.ace_comment	comment	Changes the color and style of comments.\n.ace_constant	constant	Changes the color and style of constants like TRUE, FALSE, and numeric literals.\n.ace_constant.ace_language	constant.language	Changes the color and style of language constants like TRUE and FALSE. \nThis rule set will override rules in .ace_constant for language constants. \nAlso in RMarkdown files, everything surrounded in *.\n.ace_constant.ace_numeric	constant.numeric	Changes the color and style of numeric literals. \nThis value will override the settings in the “constant” scope, if set. \nAlso in RMarkdown files, everything surrounded in **.\n.ace_cusor		Changes the color and style of the text cursor in the editor window.\n.ace_editor		Changes the default color and background of the RStudio editor windows. \nThis selector will usually be the first in a list of other selectors for the same rule set, such as .rstudio-themes-flat.ace_editor_theme and so on.\n.ace_gutter		Changes the color and style of the gutter: the panel on the left-hand side of the editor which holds line numbers, breakpoints, and fold widgets.\n.ace_gutter-active-line		Changes the color and style of the gutter at the active line in the editor.\n.ace_heading		Changes the color and style of headings in RMarkdown documents.\n.ace_indent-guide		Changes the color and style of the indent guide, which can be enabled or disabled through Global Options > Code > Display > Show indent guides.\n.ace_invisible		Changes the color and style of invisible characters, which can be enabled or disabled through Global Options > Code Display > Show whitespace characters.\n.ace_keyword	keyword	Changes the color and style of keywords like function, if, else, stop, and operators.\n.ace_keyword.ace_operator	keyword.operator	Changes the color and style of operators like (, ), =, +, and -. \nThis value will override the settings in the .ace_keyword block for operators, if set.\n.ace_meta.ace_tag	meta.tag	Changes the color and style of metadata tags in RMarkdown documents, like title and output.\n.ace_marker-layer .ace_active-debug-line	marker-layer.active_debug_line	Changes the color and style of the highlighting on the line of code which is currently being debugged.\n.ace_marker-layer .ace_bracket		Changes the color and style of the highlighting on matching brackets.\n.ace_marker-layer .ace_selection		Changes the color and style of the highlighting for the currently selected line or block of lines.\n.ace_markup.ace_heading	markup.heading	Changes the color and style of the characters that start a heading in RMarkdown documents.\n.ace_print-margin		Changes the color and style, if applicable, of the line-width margin that can be enabled or disabled through Global Options > Code > Display > Show margin.\n.ace_selection.ace_start		Changes the color and style of the highlighting for the start of the currently selected block of lines.\n.ace_string	string	Changes the color and style of string literals.\n.ace_support.ace_function	support.function	Changes the color and style of code blocks in RMarkdown documents.\nIn addition to these rule sets, you will also find a number of rule sets related to the Terminal pane, with selectors that include .terminal or selectors that begin with .xterm. \nIt is possible to change these values as well, but it may be advisable to keep a back up copy of your original theme in case you don’t like any of the changes. \nThere are also a number of classes that can be used to modify parts of RStudio unrelated to the editor. \nThese classes are all prefixed with rstheme_, with the exception of dataGridHeader and themedPopupPanel. \nAny classes you find in the html of RStudio which are not prefixed with rstheme_, ace_, or explicitly listed in this article are subject to change at anytime, and so are unsafe to use in custom themes.\n\nSince an rstheme is just CSS, anything that you can do with CSS you can do in an rstheme.\n\nTesting Changes to a Theme\nIf you’re modifying a theme which has already been added to RStudio, you may need to restart RStudio desktop in order to make the changes take effect.\n\nSharing a Theme\nOnce you’re satisfied with your theme, you can easily share it with anyone by simply sharing the tmTheme or rstheme file. \nYou can find rstheme files in \nC:/Users/(your user account)/Documents/.R/rstudio/themes on Windows\n\nYou can also use the theme related functions provided in the RStudio API to save a local copy of your converted theme.\n\nIf you upload your rstheme file to a URL-addressable location, you can also share a snippet of code that anyone can run to try your theme:\n\nrstudioapi::addTheme("http://your/theme/path/theme.rstheme", apply = TRUE)\nThis will download, install, and apply the theme immediately on the user’s machine.\n',

'<h2>S4 Classes</h2>\n<h3>The Basic Idea</h3>\nThe S4 approach differs from the S3 approach to creating a class in that it is a more rigid definition. \nThe idea is that an object is created using the <em>setClass</em> command. \nThe command takes a number of options. \nMany of the options are not required, but we make use of several of the optional arguments because they represent good practices with respect to object oriented programming.\nWe first construct a trivial, contrived class simply to demonstrate the basic idea. \nNext we demonstrate how to create a method for an S4 class. \nThis example is a little more involved than what we saw in the section on S3 classes.\nIn this example, the name of the class is <em>FirstQuadrant</em>, and the class is used to keep track of an <em>(x,y)</em> coordinate pair in the first quadrant. \nThere is a restriction that both values must be greater than or equal to zero. \nThere are two data elements, called <em>slots</em>, and they are called <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. \nThe default values for the coordinate is the origin, <em>x=0</em> and <em>y=0</em>.\n######################################################################\n# Create the first quadrant class\n#\n# This is used to represent a coordinate in the first quadrant.\nFirstQuadrant = setClass(\n    # Set the name for the class\n    "FirstQuadrant",\n\n    # Define the slots\n    slots = c( x = "numeric", y = "numeric" ),\n\n    # Set the default values for the slots. (optional)\n    prototype=list( x = 0.0, y = 0.0 ),\n\n    # Make a function that can test to see if the data is consistent.\n    # This is not called if you have an initialize function defined!\n    validity=function(object){\n        if((object@x &lt; 0) || (object@y &lt; 0)) {\n            return("A negative number for one of the coordinates was given.")\n        }\n        return(TRUE)\n    }\n)\n\nNote that the way to access one of the data elements is to use the “@” symbol. \nAn example if given below. \nIn the example three elements of the class defined above are created. \nThe first uses the default values for the slots, the second overrides the defaults, and finally an attempt is made to create a coordinate in the second quadrant.\n> x = FirstQuadrant()\n> x\nAn object of class "FirstQuadrant"\nSlot "x":\n[1] 0\nSlot "y":\n[1] 0\n> y = FirstQuadrant(x=5,y=7)\n> y\nAn object of class "FirstQuadrant"\nSlot "x":\n[1] 5\nSlot "y":\n[1] 7\n> y@x\n[1] 5\n> y@y\n[1] 7\n> z = FirstQuadrant(x=3,y=-2)\nError in validObject(.Object) :\n      invalid class “FirstQuadrant” object: A negative number for one of the coordinates was given.\n> z\nError: object \'z\' not found\n\nIn the next example we create a method that is associated with the class. \nThe method is used to set the values of a coordinate. \nThe first step is to reserve the name using the <em>setGeneric</em> command, and then the <em>setMethod</em> command is used to define the function to be called when the first argument is an object from the <em>FirstQuadrant</em> class.\n# create a method to assign the value of a coordinate setGeneric(name="setCoordinate",\n    def=function(theObject,xVal,yVal)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("setCoordinate")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="setCoordinate",\n    signature="FirstQuadrant",\n    definition=function(theObject,xVal,yVal)\n    {\n       theObject@x = xVal\n       theObject@y = yVal\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\n\nIt is important to note that R generally passes objects as values. \nFor this reason the methods defined above return the updated object. \nWhen the method is called, it is used to replace the former object with the updated object.\n> z = FirstQuadrant(x=2.5,y=10)\n> z\nAn object of class "FirstQuadrant"\nSlot "x":\n[1] 2.5\nSlot "y":\n[1] 10\n> z = setCoordinate(z,-3.0,-5.0)\n> z\nAn object of class "FirstQuadrant"\nSlot "x":\n[1] -3\nSlot "y":\n[1] -5\n\nNote that the <em>validity</em> function given in the original class definition is not called. \nIt is called when an object is first defined. \nIt can be called later, but only when an explicit request is made using the <em>validObject</em> command.\n\n<h3>Creating an S4 Class</h3>\nAn S4 class is created using the <em>setClass()</em> command. \nAt a minimum the name of the class is specified and the names of the data elements\n(slots) is specified. \nThere are a number of other options, and just as a matter of good practice we also specify a function to verify that the data is consistent (validation), and we specify the default values (the prototype). \nIn the last section of this page,\nS4 inheritance, we include an additional parameter used to specify a class hierarchy.\nIn this section we look at another example, and we examine some of the functions associated with S4 classes. \nThe example we define will be used to motivate the use of methods associated with a class, and it will be used to demonstrate inheritance later. \nThe idea is that we want to create a program to simulate a cellular automata model of a predator-prey system.\nWe do not develop the whole code here but concentrate on the data structures. \nIn particular we will create a base class for the agents. \nIn the next section we will create the basic methods for the class. \nIn the inheritance section we will discuss how to build on the class to create different predators and different prey species. \nThe basic structure of the class is shown in Figure 1.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/_images/s4AgentClass.png" />\nFigure 1.\n\nDiagram of the base class, Agent, used for the agents in a simulation.\n\nThe methods for this class are defined in the following section. \nHere we define the class and its slots, and the code to define the class is given below:\n######################################################################\n# Create the base Agent class\n#\n# This is used to represent the most basic agent in a simulation.\nAgent = setClass(\n    # Set the name for the class\n    "Agent",\n    # Define the slots\n    slots = c(\n        location = "numeric",\n        velocity   = "numeric",\n        active   = "logical"\n        ),\n    # Set the default values for the slots. \n(optional)\n    prototype=list(\n        location = c(0.0,0.0),\n        active   = TRUE,\n        velocity = c(0.0,0.0)\n        ),\n    # Make a function that can test to see if the data is consistent.\n    # This is not called if you have an initialize function defined!\n    validity=function(object)\n    {\n        if(sum(object@velocity^2)>100.0) {\n            return("The velocity level is out of bounds.")\n        }\n        return(TRUE)\n    }\n    )\n\nNow that the code to define the class is given we can create an object whose class is Agent.\n> a = Agent()\n> a\nAn object of class "Agent"\nSlot "location":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "velocity":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "active":\n[1] TRUE\n\nBefore we define the methods for the class a number of additional commands are explored. \nThe first set of functions explored are the\n<em>is.object</em> and the <em>isS4</em> commands. \nThe <em>is.object</em> command determines whether or not a variable refers to an object. \nThe <em>isS4</em>\ncommand determines whether or not the variable is an S4 object. \nThe reason both are required is that the <em>isS4</em> command alone cannot determine if a variable is an S3 object. \nYou need to determine if the variable is an object and then decide if it is S4 or not.\n> is.object(a)\n[1] TRUE\n> isS4(a)\n[1] TRUE\n\nThe next set of commands are used to get information about the data elements, or slots, within an object. \nThe first is the <em>slotNames</em>\ncommand. \nThis command can take either an object or the name of a class. \nIt returns the names of the slots associated with the class as strings.\n> slotNames(a)\n[1] "location" "velocity" "active"\n> slotNames("Agent")\n[1] "location" "velocity" "active"\n\nThe <em>getSlots</em> command is similar to the <em>slotNames</em> command. \nIt takes the name of a class as a string. \nIt returns a vector whose entries are the types associated with the slots, and the names of the entries are the names of the slots.\n> getSlots("Agent")\n     location  velocity    active\n"numeric" "numeric" "logical"\n> s = getSlots("Agent")\n> s[1]\n     location\n"numeric"\n> s[[1]]\n[1] "numeric"\n> names(s)\n[1] "location" "velocity" "active"\n\nThe next command examined is the <em>getClass</em> command. \nIt has two forms. \nIf you give it a variable that is an S4 class it returns a list of slots for the class associated with the variable. \nIf you give it a character string with the name of a class it gives the slots and their data types.\n> getClass(a)\nAn object of class "Agent"\nSlot "location":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "velocity":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "active":\n[1] TRUE\n> getClass("Agent")\nClass "Agent" [in ".GlobalEnv"]\nSlots:\nName:  location velocity   active\nClass:  numeric  numeric  logical\n\nThe final command examined is the <em>slot</em> command. \nIt can be used to get or set the value of a slot in an object. \nIt can be used in place of the “@” operator.\n> slot(a,"location")\n[1] 0 0\n> slot(a,"location") = c(1,5)\n> a\nAn object of class "Agent"\nSlot "location":\n[1] 1 5\nSlot "velocity":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "active":\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n<h3>Creating Methods</h3>\nWe now build on the Agent class defined above. \nOnce the class and its data elements are defined we can define the methods associated with the class. \nThe basic idea is that if the name of a function has not been defined, the name must first be reserved using the <em>setGeneric</em>\nfunction. \nThe <em>setMethod</em> can then be used to define which function is called based on the class names of the objects sent to it.\nWe define the methods associated with the Agent method given in the previous section. \nNote that the <em>validity</em> function for an object is only called when it is first created and when an explicit call to the\n<em>validObject</em> function is made. \nWe make use of the <em>validObject</em>\ncommand in the methods below that are used to change the value of a data element within an object.\n# create a method to assign the value of the location setGeneric(name="setLocation",\n    def=function(theObject,position)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("setLocation")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="setLocation",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject,position)\n    {\n       theObject@location = position\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\n# create a method to get the value of the location setGeneric(name="getLocation",\n    def=function(theObject)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("getLocation")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="getLocation",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       return(theObject@location)\n    }\n    )\n\n# create a method to assign the value of active setGeneric(name="setActive",\n    def=function(theObject,active)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("setActive")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="setActive",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject,active)\n    {\n       theObject@active = active\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\n# create a method to get the value of active setGeneric(name="getActive",\n    def=function(theObject)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("getActive")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="getActive",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       return(theObject@active)\n    }\n    )\n\n# create a method to assign the value of velocity setGeneric(name="setVelocity",\n    def=function(theObject,velocity)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("setVelocity")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="setVelocity",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject,velocity)\n    {\n       theObject@velocity = velocity\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\n# create a method to get the value of the velocity setGeneric(name="getVelocity",\n    def=function(theObject)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("getVelocity")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="getVelocity",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       return(theObject@velocity)\n    }\n    )\n\nWith these definitions the data elements are encapsulated and can be accessed and set using the methods given above. \nIt is generally good practice in object oriented programming to keep your data private and not show them to everybody willy nilly.\n> a = Agent()\n> getVelocity(a)\n[1] 0 0\n> a = setVelocity(a,c(1.0,2.0))\n> getVelocity(a)\n[1] 1 2\n\nThe last topic examined is the idea of overloading functions. \nIn the examples above the signature is set to a single element. \nThe signature is a vector of characters and specifies the data types of the argument list for the method to be defined. \nHere we create two new methods. \nThe name of the method is <em>resetActivity</em>, and there are two versions.\nThe first version accepts two arguments whose types are <em>Agent</em> and\n<em>logical</em>. \nThis version of the method will set the activity slot to a given value. \nThe second version accepts two arguments whose types are\n<em>Agent</em> and <em>numeric</em>. \nThis version will set the activity to TRUE and then set the energy level to the value passed to it. \nNote that the names of the variables in the argument list must be exactly the same.\n# create a method to reset the velocity and the activity setGeneric(name="resetActivity",\n    def=function(theObject,value)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("resetActivity")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="resetActivity",\n    signature=c("Agent","logical"),\n    definition=function(theObject,value)\n    {\n       theObject = setActive(theObject,value)\n       theObject = setVelocity(theObject,c(0.0,0.0))\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="resetActivity",\n    signature=c("Agent","numeric"),\n    definition=function(theObject,value)\n    {\n       theObject = setActive(theObject,TRUE)\n       theObject = setVelocity(theObject,value)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\n\nThis definition of the function yields two options for the\n<em>resetActivity</em> function. \nThe decision to determine which function to call depends on two arguments and their type. \nFor example, if the first argument is from the Agent class and the second is a value of\nTRUE or FALSE, then the first version of the function is called. \nOtherwise, if the second argument is a number the second version of the function is called.\n> a = Agent()\n> a\nAn object of class "Agent"\nSlot "location":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "velocity":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "active":\n[1] TRUE\n> a = resetActivity(a,FALSE)\n> getActive(a)\n[1] FALSE\n>  a = resetActivity(a,c(1,3))\n> getVelocity(a)\n[1] 1 3\n\n\n<h3>Inheritance</h3>\nA class’ inheritance hiearchy can be specified when the class is defined using the <em>contains</em> option. \nThe <em>contains</em> option is a vector that lists the classes the new class inherits from. \nIn the following example we build on the Agent class defined in the previous section. \nThe idea is that we need agents that represent a predator and two prey. \nWe will focus on two predators for this example.\nThe hierarchy for the classes is shown in\nFigure 2.. \n In this example we have one Prey class that is derived from the Agent class. \nThere are two predator classes, Bobcat and Lynx. \nThe Bobcat class is derived from the Agent class, and the Lynx class is derived from the Bobcat class. \nWe will keep this very simple, and the only methods associated with the new classes is a <em>move</em> method. \nFor our purposes it will only print out a message and set the values of the position and velocity to demonstrate the order of execution of the methods associated with the classes.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/_images/s4AgentPredPrey.png" />\nFigure 2.\n\nDiagram of the predator and prey classes derived from the Agent class.\n\nThe first step is to create the three new classes.\n######################################################################\n# Create the Prey class\n#\n# This is used to represent a prey animal\nPrey = setClass(\n    # Set the name for the class\n    "Prey",\n    # Define the slots - in this case it is empty...\n    slots = character(0),\n    # Set the default values for the slots. \n(optional)\n    prototype=list(),\n    # Make a function that can test to see if the data is consistent.\n    # This is not called if you have an initialize function defined!\n    validity=function(object)\n    {\n        if(sum(object@velocity^2)>70.0) {\n            return("The velocity level is out of bounds.")\n        }\n        return(TRUE)\n    },\n    # Set the inheritance for this class\n    contains = "Agent"\n    )\n\n######################################################################\n# Create the Bobcat class\n#\n# This is used to represent a smaller predator\nBobcat = setClass(\n    # Set the name for the class\n    "Bobcat",\n    # Define the slots - in this case it is empty...\n    slots = character(0),\n    # Set the default values for the slots. \n(optional)\n    prototype=list(),\n    # Make a function that can test to see if the data is consistent.\n    # This is not called if you have an initialize function defined!\n    validity=function(object)\n    {\n        if(sum(object@velocity^2)>85.0) {\n            return("The velocity level is out of bounds.")\n        }\n        return(TRUE)\n    },\n    # Set the inheritance for this class\n    contains = "Agent"\n    )\n######################################################################\n# Create the Lynx class\n#\n# This is used to represent a larger predator\nLynx = setClass(\n    # Set the name for the class\n    "Lynx",\n    # Define the slots - in this case it is empty...\n    slots = character(0),\n    # Set the default values for the slots. \n(optional)\n    prototype=list(),\n    # Make a function that can test to see if the data is consistent.\n    # This is not called if you have an initialize function defined!\n    validity=function(object)\n    {\n        if(sum(object@velocity^2)>95.0) {\n            return("The velocity level is out of bounds.")\n        }\n        return(TRUE)\n    },\n    # Set the inheritance for this class\n    contains = "Bobcat"\n    )\n\nThe inheritance is specified using the <em>contains</em> option in the\n<em>setClass</em> command. \nNote that this can be a vector allowing for multiple inheritance. \nWe choose not to use that to keep things simpler. \nIf you are feeling like you need more self-loathing in your life you should try it out and experiment.\nNext we define a method, <em>move</em>, for the new classes. \nWe will include methods for the Agent, Prey, Bobcat, and Lynx classes. \nThe methods do not really do anything but are used to demonstrate the idea of how methods are executed.\n# create a method to move the agent.\nsetGeneric(name="move",\n    def=function(theObject)\n    {\n        standardGeneric("move")\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="move",\n    signature="Agent",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       print("Move this Agent dude")\n       theObject = setVelocity(theObject,c(1,2))\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="move",\n    signature="Prey",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       print("Check this Prey before moving this dude")\n       theObject = callNextMethod(theObject)\n       print("Move this Prey dude")\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="move",\n    signature="Bobcat",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       print("Check this Bobcat before moving this dude")\n       theObject = setLocation(theObject,c(2,3))\n       theObject = callNextMethod(theObject)\n       print("Move this Bobcat dude")\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\nsetMethod(f="move",\n    signature="Lynx",\n    definition=function(theObject)\n    {\n       print("Check this Lynx before moving this dude")\n       theObject = setActive(theObject,FALSE)\n       theObject = callNextMethod(theObject)\n       print("Move this Lynx dude")\n       validObject(theObject)\n       return(theObject)\n    }\n    )\n\nThere are a number of things to note. \nFirst each method calls the\n<em>callNextMethod</em> command. \nThis command will execute the next version of the same method for the previous class in the hierarchy. \nNote that\nI have included the arguments (in the same order) as those called by the original function. \nAlso note that the function returns a copy of the object and is used to update the object passed to the original function.\nAnother thing to note is that the methods associated with the Lync,\nBobcat, and Agent classes arbitrarily change the values of the position, velocity, and activity for the given object. \nThis is done to demonstrate the changes that take place and reinforce the necessity for using the <em>callNextMethod</em> function the way it is used here.\nFinally, it should be noted that the <em>validObject</em> command is called in every method. \nYou should try adding a print statement in the validity function. \nYou might find that the order is a bit odd. \nYou should experiment with this and play with it. \nThere are times you do not get the expected results so be careful!\nWe now give a brief example to demonstrate the order that the functions are called. \nIn the example we create a Bobcat object and then call the <em>move</em> method. \nWe next create a Lynx object and do the same. \nWe print out the slots for both agents just to demonstrate the values that are changed.\n> robert = Bobcat()\n> robert\nAn object of class "Bobcat"\nSlot "location":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "velocity":\n[1] 0 0\nSlot "active":\n[1] TRUE\n> robert =

linear.ouput=FALSE: set FALSE for apply act.fct otherwise TRUE\n</code>\n<h3>Plotting Neural Network</h3>\nLet\'s plot your neural net model.\n\n<code class="lang-python"># plot neural network\nplot(nn)\n</code>\n\n<center>\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1547672260/6_y5jnhr.png" /></center>\n\n<h3>Create test dataset</h3>\nCreate test dataset using two features Technical Knowledge Score and Communication Skills Score\n\n<code class="lang-python"># creating test set\nTKS=c(30,40,85)\nCSS=c(85,50,40)\ntest=data.frame(TKS,CSS)\n</code>\n\n<h3>Predict the results for the test set</h3>\nPredict the probability score for the test data using the compute function.\n\n<code class="lang-python">## Prediction using neural network\nPredict=compute(nn,test)\nPredict$net.result\n</code>\n\n0.9928202080\n0.3335543925\n0.9775153014\n\nNow, Convert probabilities into binary classes.\n\n<code class="lang-python"># Converting probabilities into binary classes setting threshold level 0.5\nprob = Predict$net.result\npred = ifelse(prob>0.5, 1, 0)\npred\n</code>\n\n1\n0\n1\n\nPredicted results are 1,0, and 1.\n\n<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>\nNeural networks are more flexible and can be used with both regression and classification problems. \nNeural networks are good for the nonlinear dataset with a large number of inputs such as images. \nNeural networks can work with any number of inputs and layers. \nNeural networks have the numerical strength that can perform jobs in parallel.\n\nThere are more alternative algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree and Regression are available that are simple, fast, easy to train, and provide better performance. \nNeural networks are much more of the black box, require more time for development and more computation power. \nNeural Networks requires more data than other Machine Learning algorithms. \nNNs can be used only with numerical inputs and non-missing value datasets. \nA well-known neural network researcher said <i> "A neural network is the second best way to solve any problem. \nThe best way is to actually understand the problem,"</i>\n\n<h3>Use-cases of NN</h3>\nNN\'s wonderful properties offer many applications such as:\n\n<k>Pattern Recognition:</k>  neural networks are very suitable for pattern recognition problems such as facial recognition, object detection, fingerprint recognition, etc.\n<k>Anomaly Detection:</k> neural networks are good at pattern detection, and they can easily detect the unusual patterns that don’t fit in the general patterns.\n<k>Time Series Prediction:</k> Neural networks can be used to predict time series problems such as stock price, weather forecasting.\n<k>Natural Language Processing:</k> Neural networks offer a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing tasks such as text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech Tagging, Speech Recognition, and Spell Checking.\n\n',

Supervised Learning</h4>\n\n<k>How it works:</k> This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). \nUsing these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. \nThe training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. \nExamples of Supervised Learning: Regression, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/decision-tree-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decision Tree</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/introduction-random-forest-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random Forest</a>, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.\n\n<h4>2. Unsupervised Learning</h4>\n\n<k>How it works: </k>In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. \nIt is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention. \nExamples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means.\n\n<h4>3. Reinforcement Learning:</h4>\n\n<k>How it works:</k> Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. \nIt works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. \nThis machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. \nExample of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process\n\n<h3><k>List of Common Machine Learning Algorithms</k></h3>\nHere is the list of commonly used machine learning algorithms. \nThese algorithms can be applied to almost any data problem:\n\nLinear Regression\nLogistic Regression\nDecision Tree\nSVM\nNaive Bayes\nkNN\nK-Means\nRandom Forest\nDimensionality Reduction Algorithms\nGradient Boosting algorithms\nGBM\nXGBoost\nLightGBM\nCatBoost\n\n<h3>1. Linear Regression</h3>\nIt is used to estimate real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.) based on continuous variable(s). \nHere, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line. \nThis best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation Y= a *X + b.\n\nThe best way to understand linear regression is to relive this experience of childhood. \nLet us say, you ask a child in fifth grade to arrange people in his class by increasing order of weight, without asking them their weights! What do you think the child will do? He / she would likely look (visually analyze) at the height and build of people and arrange them using a combination of these visible parameters. \nThis is linear regression in real life! The child has actually figured out that height and build would be correlated to the weight by a relationship, which looks like the equation above.\n\nIn this equation:\n\nY – Dependent Variable\na – Slope\nX – Independent variable\nb – Intercept\n\nThese coefficients a and b are derived based on minimizing the sum of squared difference of distance between data points and regression line.\n\nLook at the below example. \nHere we have identified the best fit line having linear equation <k>y=0.2811x+13.9</k>. \nNow using this equation, we can find the weight, knowing the height of a person.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Linear_Regression.png">\n\nLinear Regression is mainly of two types: Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. \nSimple Linear Regression is characterized by one independent variable. \nAnd, Multiple Linear Regression(as the name suggests) is characterized by multiple (more than 1) independent variables. \nWhile finding the best fit line, you can fit a polynomial or curvilinear regression. \nAnd these are known as polynomial or curvilinear regression.\n\nHere\'s a coding window to try out your hand and build your own linear regression model in Python:\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\n#Load Train and Test datasets\n#Identify feature and response variable(s) and values must be numeric and numpy arrays\nx_train = input_variables_values_training_datasets\ny_train = target_variables_values_training_datasets\nx_test = input_variables_values_test_datasets\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# Train the model using the training sets and check score\nlinear = lm(y_train ~ ., data = x)\nsummary(linear)\n#Predict Output\npredicted= predict(linear,x_test)\n\n<h3>2. Logistic Regression</h3>\nDon\'t get confused by its name! It is a classification not a regression algorithm. \nIt is used to estimate discrete values ( Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s). \nIn simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">logit function</a>. \nHence, it is also known as <k>logit regression</k>. \nSince, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).\n\nAgain, let us try and understand this through a simple example.\n\nLet\'s say your friend gives you a puzzle to solve. \nThere are only 2 outcome scenarios – either you solve it or you don\'t. \nNow imagine, that you are being given wide range of puzzles / quizzes in an attempt to understand which subjects you are good at. \nThe outcome to this study would be something like this – if you are given a trignometry based tenth grade problem, you are 70% likely to solve it. \nOn the other hand, if it is grade fifth history question, the probability of getting an answer is only 30%. \nThis is what Logistic Regression provides you.\n\nComing to the math, the log odds of the outcome is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables.\n\nodds= p/ (1-p) = probability of event occurrence / probability of not event occurrence\nln(odds) = ln(p/(1-p))\nlogit(p) = ln(p/(1-p)) = b0+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3....+bkXk\n\nAbove, p is the probability of presence of the characteristic of interest. \nIt chooses parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the sample values rather than that minimize the sum of squared errors (like in ordinary regression).\n\nNow, you may ask, why take a log? For the sake of simplicity, let\'s just say that this is one of the best mathematical way to replicate a step function. \nI can go in more details, but that will beat the purpose of this article.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Logistic_Regression.png">\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# Train the model using the training sets and check score\nlogistic = glm(y_train ~ ., data = x,family=\'binomial\')\nsummary(logistic)\n#Predict Output\npredicted= predict(logistic,x_test)\n\n<h4>Furthermore..</h4>\n\nThere are many different steps that could be tried in order to improve the model:\n\nincluding interaction terms\nremoving features\n<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/02/avoid-over-fitting-regularization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regularization techniques</a>\nusing a non-linear model\n\n<h3>3. Decision Tree</h3>\nThis is one of my favorite algorithm and I use it quite frequently. \nIt is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. \nSurprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. \nIn this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. \nThis is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible. \nFor more details, you can read: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/decision-tree-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decision Tree Simplified</a>.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IkBzK.png">\n\nsource: <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">statsexchange</a>\n\nIn the image above, you can see that population is classified into four different groups based on multiple attributes to identify &#8216;if they will play or not\'. \nTo split the population into different heterogeneous groups, it uses various techniques like Gini, Information Gain, Chi-square, entropy.\n\nThe best way to understand how decision tree works, is to play Jezzball – a classic game from Microsoft (image below). \nEssentially, you have a room with moving walls and you need to create walls such that maximum area gets cleared off with out the balls.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/download.jpg">\n\nSo, every time you split the room with a wall, you are trying to create 2 different populations with in the same room. \nDecision trees work in very similar fashion by dividing a population in as different groups as possible.\n\n<em>More</em>: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/decision-tree-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simplified Version of Decision Tree Algorithms</a>\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\nlibrary(rpart)\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# grow tree \nfit = rpart(y_train ~ ., data = x,method="class")\nsummary(fit)\n#Predict Output \npredicted= predict(fit,x_test)\n\n<h3>4. SVM (Support Vector Machine)</h3>\nIt is a classification method. \nIn this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.\n\nFor example, if we only had two features like Height and Hair length of an individual, we\'d first plot these two variables in two dimensional space where each point has two co-ordinates (these co-ordinates are known as <k>Support Vectors</k>)\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SVM1.png">\n\nNow, we will find some <em>line</em> that splits the data between the two differently classified groups of data. \nThis will be the line such that the distances from the closest point in each of the two groups will be farthest away.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SVM2-300x204.png">\n\nIn the example shown above, the line which splits the data into two differently classified groups is the <em>black</em> line, since the two closest points are the farthest apart from the line. \nThis line is our classifier. \nThen, depending on where the testing data lands on either side of the line, that\'s what class we can classify the new data as.\n\nMore: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/10/support-vector-machine-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simplified Version of Support Vector Machine</a>\n\n<k>Think of this algorithm as playing JezzBall in n-dimensional space. \nThe tweaks in the game are:</k>\n\nYou can draw lines/planes at any angles (rather than just horizontal or vertical as in the classic game)\nThe objective of the game is to segregate balls of different colors in different rooms.\nAnd the balls are not moving.\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\nlibrary(e1071)\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# Fitting model\nfit =svm(y_train ~ ., data = x)\nsummary(fit)\n#Predict Output \npredicted= predict(fit,x_test)\n\n<h3>5. Naive Bayes</h3>\nIt is a classification technique based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bayes’ theorem</a> with an assumption of independence between predictors. \nIn simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. \nFor example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. \nEven if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, a naive Bayes classifier would consider all of these properties to independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple.\n\n<a href="https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/naive-bayes?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=common-machine-learning-algorithms">Naive Bayesian</a> model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. \nAlong with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.\n\nBayes theorem provides a way of calculating posterior probability P(c|x) from P(c), P(x) and P(x|c). \nLook at the equation below:<br />\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bayes_rule-300x172.png">\n\nHere,\n\n<i>P</i>(<i>c|x</i>) is the posterior probability of <i>class</i> (<i>target</i>) given <i>predictor</i> (<i>attribute</i>). \n\n<i>P</i>(<i>c</i>) is the prior probability of <i>class</i>. \n\n<i>P</i>(<i>x|c</i>) is the likelihood which is the probability of <i>predictor</i> given <i>class</i>. \n\n<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>) is the prior probability of <i>predictor</i>.\n\n<k>Example: </k>Let\'s understand it using an example. \nBelow I have a training data set of weather and corresponding target variable &#8216;Play\'. \nNow, we need to classify whether players will play or not based on weather condition. \nLet\'s follow the below steps to perform it.\n\nStep 1: Convert the data set to frequency table\n\nStep 2: Create Likelihood table by finding the probabilities like Overcast probability = 0.29 and probability of playing is 0.64.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bayes_41.png">\n\nStep 3: Now, use Naive Bayesian equation to calculate the posterior probability for each class. \nThe class with the highest posterior probability is the outcome of prediction.\n\n<k>Problem: </k>Players will pay if weather is sunny, is this statement is correct?\n\nWe can solve it using above discussed method, so P(Yes | Sunny) = P( Sunny | Yes) * P(Yes) / P (Sunny)\n\nHere we have P (Sunny |Yes) = 3/9 = 0.33, P(Sunny) = 5/14 = 0.36, P( Yes)= 9/14 = 0.64\n\nNow, P (Yes | Sunny) = 0.33 * 0.64 / 0.36 = 0.60, which has higher probability.\n\n<a href="https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/naive-bayes?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=common-machine-learning-algorithms">Naive Bayes</a> uses a similar method to predict the probability of different class based on various attributes. \nThis algorithm is mostly used in text classification and with problems having multiple classes.\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\nlibrary(e1071)\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# Fitting model\nfit =naiveBayes(y_train ~ ., data = x)\nsummary(fit)\n#Predict Output \npredicted= predict(fit,x_test)\n\n<h3>6. kNN (k- Nearest Neighbors)</h3>\nIt can be used for both classification and regression problems. \nHowever, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. \nK nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors. \nThe case being assigned to the class is most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function.\n\nThese distance functions can be Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski and Hamming distance. \nFirst three functions are used for continuous function and fourth one (Hamming) for categorical variables. \nIf K = 1, then the case is simply assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor. \nAt times, choosing K turns out to be a challenge while performing kNN modeling.\n\nMore: <a href="http://Introduction to k-nearest neighbors : Simplified">Introduction to k-nearest neighbors : Simplified</a>.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/KNN.png">\n\nKNN can easily be mapped to our real lives. \nIf you want to learn about a person, of whom you have no information, you might like to find out about his close friends and the circles he moves in and gain access to his/her information!\n\n<k>Things to consider before selecting kNN:</k>\n\nKNN is computationally expensive\nVariables should be normalized else higher range variables can bias it\nWorks on pre-processing stage more before going for kNN like an outlier, noise removal\n\n<h5>Python Code</h5>\n\'\'\'\nThe following code is for the K-Nearest Neighbors\nCreated by -

K-Means</h3>\nIt is a type of unsupervised algorithm which solves the clustering problem. \nIts procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters). \nData points inside a cluster are homogeneous and heterogeneous to peer groups.\n\nRemember figuring out shapes from ink blots? k means is somewhat similar this activity. \nYou look at the shape and spread to decipher how many different clusters / population are present!\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/splatter_ink_blot_texture_by_maki_tak-d5p6zph-284x300.jpg">\n\n<k>How K-means forms cluster:</k>\n\nK-means picks k number of points for each cluster known as centroids.\nEach data point forms a cluster with the closest centroids i.e. k clusters.\nFinds the centroid of each cluster based on existing cluster members. \nHere we have new centroids.\nAs we have new centroids, repeat step 2 and 3. \nFind the closest distance for each data point from new centroids and get associated with new k-clusters. \nRepeat this process until convergence occurs i.e. centroids does not change.\n\n<k>How to determine value of K:</k>\n\nIn K-means, we have clusters and each cluster has its own centroid. \nSum of square of difference between centroid and the data points within a cluster constitutes within sum of square value for that cluster. \nAlso, when the sum of square values for all the clusters are added, it becomes total within sum of square value for the cluster solution.\n\nWe know that as the number of cluster increases, this value keeps on decreasing but if you plot the result you may see that the sum of squared distance decreases sharply up to some value of k, and then much more slowly after that. \nHere, we can find the optimum number of cluster.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Kmenas-1024x516.png">\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\nlibrary(cluster)\nfit = kmeans(X, 3) # 5 cluster solution\n\n<h3>8. Random Forest</h3>\nRandom Forest is a trademark term for an ensemble of decision trees. \nIn Random Forest, we\'ve collection of decision trees (so known as &#8220;Forest&#8221;). \nTo classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and we say the tree &#8220;votes&#8221; for that class. \nThe forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).\n\nEach tree is planted & grown as follows:\n\nIf the number of cases in the training set is N, then sample of N cases is taken at random but <em>with replacement</em>. \nThis sample will be the training set for growing the tree.\nIf there are M input variables, a number m&lt;&lt;M is specified such that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and the best split on these m is used to split the node. \nThe value of m is held constant during the forest growing.\nEach tree is grown to the largest extent possible. \nThere is no pruning.\n\nFor more details on this algorithm, comparing with decision tree and tuning model parameters, I would suggest you to read these articles:\n\n<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/introduction-random-forest-simplified/">Introduction to Random forest – Simplified</a>\n\n<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/comparing-cart-random-forest-1/">Comparing a CART model to Random Forest (Part 1)</a>\n\n<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/comparing-random-forest-simple-cart-model/">Comparing a Random Forest to a CART model (Part 2)</a>\n\n<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/06/tuning-random-forest-model/">Tuning the parameters of your Random Forest model</a>\n\n<k>R Code</k>\n\nlibrary(randomForest)\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# Fitting model\nfit = randomForest(Species ~ ., x,ntree=500)\nsummary(fit)\n#Predict Output \npredicted= predict(fit,x_test)\n\n<h3>9. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms</h3>\nIn the last 4-5 years, there has been an exponential increase in data capturing at every possible stages. \nCorporates/ Government Agencies/ Research organisations are not only coming with new sources but also they are capturing data in great detail.\n\nFor example: E-commerce companies are capturing more details about customer like their demographics, web crawling history, what they like or dislike, purchase history, feedback and many others to give them personalized attention more than your nearest grocery shopkeeper.\n\nAs a data scientist, the data we are offered also consist of many features, this sounds good for building good robust model but there is a challenge. \nHow\'d you identify highly significant variable(s) out 1000 or 2000? In such cases, dimensionality reduction algorithm helps us along with various other algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, PCA, Factor Analysis, Identify based on correlation matrix, missing value ratio and others.\n\nTo know more about this algorithms, you can read &#8220;<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/dimension-reduction-methods/">Beginners Guide To Learn Dimension Reduction Techniques</a>&#8220;.\n\nlibrary(stats)\npca = princomp(train, cor = TRUE)\ntrain_reduced  = predict(pca,train)\ntest_reduced  = predict(pca,test)\n\n<h3>10. Gradient Boosting Algorithms</h3>\n<h4>10.1. \nGBM</h4>\n\nGBM is a boosting algorithm used when we deal with plenty of data to make a prediction with high prediction power. \nBoosting is actually an ensemble of learning algorithms which combines the prediction of several base estimators in order to improve robustness over a single estimator. \nIt combines multiple weak or average predictors to a build strong predictor. \nThese boosting algorithms always work well in data science competitions like Kaggle, AV Hackathon, CrowdAnalytix.\n\nMore: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/boosting-algorithms-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Know about Boosting algorithms in detail</a>\n\nlibrary(caret)\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n# Fitting model\nfitControl = trainControl( method = "repeatedcv", number = 4, repeats = 4)\nfit = train(y ~ ., data = x, method = "gbm", trControl = fitControl,verbose = FALSE)\npredicted= predict(fit,x_test,type= "prob")[,2] \n\nGradientBoostingClassifier and Random Forest are two different boosting tree classifier and often people ask about the <a href="http://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com/t/what-is-the-fundamental-difference-between-randomforest-and-gradient-boosting-algorithms/2341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference between these two algorithms</a>.\n\n<h4>10.2. \nXGBoost</h4>\n\nAnother classic gradient boosting algorithm that\'s known to be the decisive choice between winning and losing in some Kaggle competitions.\n\nThe XGBoost has an immensely high predictive power which makes it the best choice for accuracy in events as it possesses both linear model and the tree learning algorithm, making the algorithm almost 10x faster than existing gradient booster techniques.\n\nThe support includes various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about the XGBoost is that it is also called a regularized boosting technique. \nThis helps to reduce overfit modelling and has a massive support for a range of languages such as Scala, Java, R, Python, Julia and C++.\n\nSupports distributed and widespread training on many machines that encompass GCE, AWS, Azure and Yarn clusters. \nXGBoost can also be integrated with Spark, Flink and other cloud dataflow systems with a built in cross validation at each iteration of the boosting process.\n\nTo learn more about XGBoost and parameter tuning, visit <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/</a>.\n\nrequire(caret)\nx = cbind(x_train,y_train)\n\n# Fitting model\nTrainControl = trainControl( method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 4)\n\nmodel= train(y ~ ., data = x, method = "xgbLinear", trControl = TrainControl,verbose = FALSE)\n\nOR \n\nmodel= train(y ~ ., data = x, method = "xgbTree", trControl = TrainControl,verbose = FALSE)\n\npredicted = predict(model, x_test)\n\n<h4>10.3. LightGBM</h4>\n\nLightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. \nIt is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:\n\nFaster training speed and higher efficiency\nLower memory usage\nBetter accuracy\nParallel and GPU learning supported\nCapable of handling large-scale data\n\nThe framework is a fast and high-performance gradient boosting one based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. \nIt was developed under the Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit Project of Microsoft.\n\nSince the LightGBM is based on decision tree algorithms, it splits the tree leaf wise with the best fit whereas other boosting algorithms split the tree depth wise or level wise rather than leaf-wise. \nSo when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms.\n\nAlso, it is surprisingly very fast, hence the word &#8216;Light\'.\n\nRefer to the article to know more about LightGBM: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/which-algorithm-takes-the-crown-light-gbm-vs-xgboost/">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/which-algorithm-takes-the-crown-light-gbm-vs-xgboost/</a>\n\nPython Code:\n\ndata = np.random.rand(500, 10) # 500 entities, each contains 10 features\nlabel = np.random.randint(2, size=500) # binary target\n\ntrain_data = lgb.Dataset(data, label=label)\ntest_data = train_data.create_valid(\'test.svm\')\n\nparam = {\'num_leaves\':31, \'num_trees\':100, \'objective\':\'binary\'}\nparam[\'metric\'] = \'auc\'\n\nnum_round = 10\nbst = lgb.train(param, train_data, num_round, valid_sets=[test_data])\n\nbst.save_model(\'model.txt\')\n\n# 7 entities, each contains 10 features\ndata = np.random.rand(7, 10)\nypred = bst.predict(data)\n\nR Code:\n\nlibrary(RLightGBM)\ndata(example.binary)\n#Parameters\n\nnum_iterations = 100\nconfig = list(objective = "binary",  metric="binary_logloss,auc", learning_rate = 0.1, num_leaves = 63, tree_learner = "serial", feature_fraction = 0.8, bagging_freq = 5, bagging_fraction = 0.8, min_data_in_leaf = 50, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf = 5.0)\n\n#Create data handle and booster\nhandle.data = lgbm.data.create(x)\n\nlgbm.data.setField(handle.data, "label", y)\n\nhandle.booster = lgbm.booster.create(handle.data, lapply(config, as.character))\n\n#Train for num_iterations iterations and eval every 5 steps\n\nlgbm.booster.train(handle.booster, num_iterations, 5)\n\n#Predict\npred = lgbm.booster.predict(handle.booster, x.test)\n\n#Test accuracy\nsum(y.test == (y.pred > 0.5)) / length(y.test)\n\n#Save model (can be loaded again via lgbm.booster.load(filename))\nlgbm.booster.save(handle.booster, filename = "/tmp/model.txt")\n\nIf you\'re familiar with the Caret package in R, this is another way of implementing the LightGBM.\n\nrequire(caret)\nrequire(RLightGBM)\ndata(iris)\n\nmodel =caretModel.LGBM()\n\nfit = train(Species ~ ., data = iris, method=model, verbosity = 0)\nprint(fit)\ny.pred = predict(fit, iris[,1:4])\n\nlibrary(Matrix)\nmodel.sparse = caretModel.LGBM.sparse()\n\n#Generate a sparse matrix\nmat = Matrix(as.matrix(iris[,1:4]), sparse = T)\nfit = train(data.frame(idx = 1:nrow(iris)), iris$Species, method = model.sparse, matrix = mat, verbosity = 0)\nprint(fit)\n\n<h4>10.4. Catboost</h4>\n\nCatBoost is a recently open-sourced machine learning algorithm from Yandex. \nIt can easily integrate with deep learning frameworks like Google\'s TensorFlow and Apple\'s Core ML.\n\nThe best part about CatBoost is that it does not require extensive data training like other ML models, and can work on a variety of data formats; not undermining how robust it can be.\n\nMake sure you handle missing data well before you proceed with the implementation.\n\nCatboost can automatically deal with categorical variables without showing the type conversion error, which helps you to focus on tuning your model better rather than sorting out trivial errors.\n\nLearn more about Catboost from this article: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/catboost-automated-categorical-data/">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/catboost-automated-categorical-data/</a>\n\nPython Code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom catboost import CatBoostRegressor\n\n#Read training and testing files\ntrain = pd.read_csv("train.csv")\ntest = pd.read_csv("test.csv")\n\n#Imputing missing values for both train and test\ntrain.fillna(-999, inplace=True)\ntest.fillna(-999,inplace=True)\n\n#Creating a training set for modeling and validation set to check model performance\nX = train.drop([\'Item_Outlet_Sales\'], axis=1)\ny = train.Item_Outlet_Sales\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_validation, y_train, y_validation = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.7, random_state=1234)\ncategorical_features_indices = np.where(X.dtypes != np.float)[0]\n\n#importing library and building model\nfrom catboost import CatBoostRegressormodel=CatBoostRegressor(iterations=50, depth=3, learning_rate=0.1, loss_function=\'RMSE\')\n\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train,cat_features=categorical_features_indices,eval_set=(X_validation, y_validation),plot=True)\n\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame()\n\nsubmission[\'Item_Identifier\'] = test[\'Item_Identifier\']\nsubmission[\'Outlet_Identifier\'] = test[\'Outlet_Identifier\']\nsubmission[\'Item_Outlet_Sales\'] = model.predict(test)\n\nR Code:\n\nset.seed(1)\n\nrequire(titanic)\n\nrequire(caret)\n\nrequire(catboost)\n\ntt = titanic::titanic_train[complete.cases(titanic::titanic_train),]\n\ndata = as.data.frame(as.matrix(tt), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\ndrop_columns = c("PassengerId", "Survived", "Name", "Ticket", "Cabin")\n\nx = data[,!(names(data) %in% drop_columns)]y = data[,c("Survived")]\n\nfit_control = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 4,classProbs = TRUE)\n\ngrid = expand.grid(depth = c(4, 6, 8),learning_rate = 0.1,iterations = 100, l2_leaf_reg = 1e-3,            rsm = 0.95, border_count = 64)\n\nreport = train(x, as.factor(make.names(y)),method = catboost.caret,verbose = TRUE, preProc = NULL,tuneGrid = grid, trControl = fit_control)\n\nprint(report)\n\nimportance = varImp(report, scale = FALSE)\n\nprint(importance)\n\n<h3>Projects</h3>\nNow, its time to take the plunge and actually play with some other real datasets. \nSo are you ready to take on the challenge?

'<h2>The bootstrap</h2>\n\n  Getting started with the \nboot\' package in R for bootstrap inference\n\nThe package <code>boot</code> has elegant and powerful support for\nbootstrapping. In order to use it, you have to repackage your\nestimation function as follows.\n\nR has very elegant and abstract notation in array indexes. Suppose\nthere is an integer vector <code>OBS</code> containing the elements 2,\n3, 7, i.e. that <code>OBS = c(2,3,7);</code>. Suppose x is a\nvector. Then the notation <code>x[OBS]</code> is a vector containing\nelements x[2], x[3] and x[7]. This beautiful notation works for x as a\ndataset (data frame) also. Here are demos:\n\n# For vectors --\n> x = c(10,20,30,40,50)\n> d = c(3,2,2)\n> x[d]\n[1] 30 20 20\n\n# For data frames --\n> D = data.frame(x=seq(10,50,10), y=seq(500,100,-100))\n> t(D)\n    1   2   3   4   5\nx  10  20  30  40  50\ny 500 400 300 200 100\n> D[d,]\n     x   y\n3   30 300\n2   20 400\n2.1 20 400\n\nNow for the key point: how does the R boot package work? The R\npackage <code>boot</code> repeatedly calls your estimation function,\nand each time, the bootstrap sample is supplied using an integer\nvector of indexes like above. Let me show you two examples of how you\nwould write estimation functions which are compatible with the\npackage:\n\nsamplemean = function(x, d) {\n  return(mean(x[d]))\n}\n\nsamplemedian = function(x, d) {\n  return(median(x[d]))\n}\n\nThe estimation function (that you write) consumes data\n<code>x</code> and a vector of indices <code>d</code>. This function\nwill be called many times, one for each bootstrap replication. Every\ntime, the data \nx\' will be the same, and the bootstrap sample \nd\' will\nbe different.\n\nAt each call, the boot package will supply a fresh set of indices\nd. The notation x[d] allows us to make a brand-new vector (the\nbootstrap sample), which is given to mean() or median(). This reflects\nsampling with replacement from the original data vector.\n\nOnce you have written a function like this, here is how you would\nobtain bootstrap estimates of the standard deviation of the\ndistribution of the median:\n\n    b = boot(x, samplemedian, R=1000)           # 1000 replications\n\nThe object \nb\' that is returned by boot() is interesting and\nuseful. Say ?boot to learn about it. For example, after making\n<code>b</code> as shown above, you can say:\n\n    print(sd(b$t[,1]))\n\nHere, I\'m using the fact that b$t is a matrix containing 1000 rows\nwhich holds all the results of estimation. The 1st column in it is the\nonly thing being estimated by samplemedian(), which is the sample\nmedian.\n\nThe default plot() operator does nice things when fed with this\nobject. Try it: say <code>plot(b)</code>',
'<h2>Dealing with data frames</h2>\n\nHere is an example, which uses the bootstrap to report the ratio of\ntwo standard deviations:\n\nlibrary(boot)\n\nsdratio = function(D, d) {\n  E=D[d,]\n  return(sd(E$x)/sd(E$y))\n}\n\nx = runif(100)\ny = 2*runif(100)\nD = data.frame(x, y)\n\nb = boot(D, sdratio, R=1000)\ncat("Standard deviation of sdratio = ", sd(b$t[,1]), "/n")\nci = boot.ci(b, type="basic")\ncat("95% CI from ", ci$basic[1,4], " - ", ci$basic[1,5], "/n")\n\nNote the beautiful syntax <code>E = D[d,]</code> which gives you a\ndata frame E using the rows out of data frame D that are specified by\nthe integer vector d.',
'<h2>Sending more stuff to your estimation function</h2>\n\nMany times, you want to send additional things to your estimation\nfunction. You\'re allowed to say whatever you want to boot(), after you\nhave supplied the two mandatory things that he wants. Here\'s an\nexample: the trimmed mean.\n\nThe R function mean() is general, and will also do a trimmed\nmean. If you say mean(x, 0.1), then it will remove the most extreme\n10% of the data at both the top and the bottom, and report the mean of\nthe middle 80%. Suppose you want to explore the sampling\ncharacteristics of the trimmed mean using boot(). You would write this:\n\ntrimmedmean = function(x, d, trim=0) {\n  return(mean(x[d], trim/length(x)))\n}\n\nHere, I\'m defaulting trim to 0. And, I\'ll allowing the caller to\ntalk in the units of observations, not fractions of the data. So the\nuser would say "5" to trim off the most extreme 5 observations at the\ntop and the bottom. I convert that into fractions before feeding this\nto mean().\n\nHere\'s how you would call boot() using this:\n\n    b = boot(x, trimmedmean, R=1000, trim=5)\n\nThis sends the extra argument trim=5 to boot, which sends it on to\nour trimmedmean() function.',
'<h2>Finding out more</h2>\n\nThe boot() function is very powerful. The above examples only\nscratch the surface. Among other things, it does things like the block\nbootstrap for time-series data, randomly censored data, etc. The\nmanual can be accessed by saying:\n\nlibrary(boot)\n?boot\n\nbut what you really need is the article <i>Resampling Methods in R:\nThe <code>boot</code> package</i> by Angelo J.

'<h2>Doing MLE with your own likelihood function</h2>\n\n  Roll your own likelihood function with R\n\nThis document assumes you know something about maximum likelihood\nestimation. It helps you get going in terms of doing MLE in R. All\nthrough this, we will use the "ordinary least squares" (OLS) model\n(a.k.a. "linear regression" or "classical least squares" (CLS)) as the\nsimplest possible example. <a href="ols-lf.pdf">Here are the formulae\nfor the OLS likelihood, and the notation that I use.</a>\n\nThere are two powerful optimisers in R: optim() and nlminb().\nThis note only uses optim(). You should also explore nlminb().\n\nYou might find it convenient to <a href="mlefiles.tar.bz2">snarf\na tarfile of all the .R programs involved in this page.</a>',
'<h2>Writing the likelihood function</h2>\n\nYou have to write an R function which computes out the likelihood\nfunction. As always in R, this can be done in several different\nways.\n\nOne issue is that of restrictions upon parameters. When the search\nalgorithm is running, it may stumble upon nonsensical values - such as\na sigma below 0 - and you do need to think about this. One traditional\nway to deal with this is to "transform the parameter space". As an\nexample, for all positive values of sigma, log(sigma) ranges from\n-infinity to +infinity. So it\'s safe to do an unconstrained search\nusing log(sigma) as the free parameter.\n\n<a href="html/ols_lfn.html">Here is the OLS likelihood, written in a few ways.</a>\n\nConfucius he said, when you write a likelihood function, do take\nthe trouble of also writing it\'s gradient (the vector of first\nderivatives). You don\'t absolutely need it, but it\'s highly\nrecommended. In my toy experiment, this seems to be merely a question\nof speed - using the analytical gradient makes the MLE go faster. But\nthe OLS likelihood is unique and simple; it is globally quasiconcave\nand has a clear top. There could not be a simpler task for a\nmaximisation routine. In more complex situations, numerical\nderivatives are known to give more unstable searches, while analytical\nderivatives give more reliable answers.',

'<h2>Comparing these alternatives</h2>\n\nNow that I\'ve written the OLS likelihood function in a few ways,\nit\'s natural to ask: Do they all give the same answer? And, which is\nthe fastest?\n\nI <a href="html/lfn_testing_timing.html">wrote a simple R program in order\nto learn these things</a>.

This uses BFGS instead of L-BFGS-B --\ni.e. no constraints are permitted. Analytical derivatives are used.\n\n<i>Nelder-Mead, trans.</i>. Nelder-Mead is a derivative-free\nalgorithm. It does not need you to write the gradient. This variant\nuses the log() transformation in order to ensure that sigma is positive.\n\n<i>Nelder-Mead</i> This is Nelder-Mead without the transformation.\n\n<i>L-BFGS-B, numerical</i> This is the same L-BFGS-B but instead\nof giving him analytical derivative, I leave optim() to fend for himself\nwith numerical derivatives. A worse than doubling of cost!\n\n<i>BFGS, trans., numerical</i> This uses plain BFGS, with\nthe log() transformation to ensure that sigma stays positive, but using\nnumerical derivatives.\n\n<i>BFGS, numerical</i> This is plain BFGS, with no transformation\nto ensure a sane sigma, and using numerical derivatives.\n\n<i>SANN</i> This is a stochastic search algorithm based on\nsimulated annealing. As you see, it failed for 1% of the runs. It is\nvery costly. The attraction is that it might be more effective at\nfinding global maxima and in "staying out of troublesome territory".\n\n<i>SANN trans.</i> This uses the log() transform for sigma\nand does the search using simulated annealing.\n',

'<h2>XPath for Web Scraping</h2>\n<a href="https://www.opencodez.com/how-to-guide/how-to-use-xpath-for-web-scraping-with-r.htm" class="whitebut ">XPath for Web Scraping</a>\n\nWe have already learned about Web Scraping Technology in our previous post <a href="https://www.opencodez.com/web-development/web-scraping-using-beautiful-soup-part-1.htm" target="_blank">Web Scraping Using Beautiful Soup in Python.</a> In addition to that, a learner/developer might also be interested in fetching nodes/elements from the HTML or XML document using XPaths.\n\n<h3>XPath For Web Scraping with R:</h3>\nThis article essentially elaborates on XPath and explains how to use XPath for web scraping with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)" target="_blank">R Programming language</a>.\n\n<h3>What is XPath</h3>\nXPath stands for XML Path Language. \nIt is a query language to extract nodes from HTML or XML documents.\n\n<h3>Required Tools and Knowledge</h3>\nR Programming Language\nXML Package\nHTML/XML\n\n<h3>How to get XPath in Mozilla Firefox Browser</h3>\nLet us see how to find out XPath of any element on <a href="https://www.opencodez.com/" target="_blank">www.opencodez.com</a> using the Mozilla Firefox browser. \nWe want to identify the XPath for the heading text of the first article on the home page. \nWhen we right-click on the highlighted element, we can find the Inspect Element option. \nA screenshot is attached below.\n\n<img class="lazy" src="https://www.opencodez.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Title-Tag-Inspect-Element-1024x511.png">\n\nObserving the element HTML Code, we can identify that our target text is contained in the &#8216;a\' tag. \n(highlighted in blue at the lower section of the screenshot). \nNext, we need to right-click on the blue highlight. \nAnother box with several options opens up. \nClick on &#8220;Copy&#8221; which will show us new options. \nThere will be an XPath option also. \nClick on that. \nHave a look at it in the below screenshot.\n\n<img class="lazy" src="https://www.opencodez.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/XPath-option-1024x526.png">\n\nCopy this XPath in any text file and check how does it look like. \nThe XPath copied is /html/body/div[2]/div/div/div/div[1]/div[1]/article[1]/header/h2/a.\n\n<h3>Absolute and Relative XPath</h3>\n<h3>Absolute Path &#8211;</h3>\nThe XPath provided above is called the absolute path. \nIt starts with &#8216;/\' and traverses from the root node to the target node. \nLet us take a look if this XPath is correctly identified by Firefox. \nThe set of commands is provided below.\n\nAbsolute Path\n\nlibrary(XML)\nurl = "https://www.opencodez.com/"\nsource = readLines(url, encoding = "UTF-8")\nparsed_doc = htmlParse(source, encoding = "UTF-8")\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc, path = \'/html/body/div[2]/div/div/div/div[1]/div[1]/article[1]/header/h2/a\', xmlValue)\n\n12345\n\nlibrary(XML)url = "https://www.opencodez.com/"source = readLines(url, encoding = "UTF-8")parsed_doc = htmlParse(source, encoding = "UTF-8")xpathSApply(parsed_doc, path = \'/html/body/div[2]/div/div/div/div[1]/div[1]/article[1]/header/h2/a\', xmlValue)\n\nWhen we run the commands in R Studio, we find that the result is a NULL. \nThe corrected XPath is provided below.\n\nAbsolute XPath\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc, path = \'/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/article[1]/header/h2/a\', xmlValue)\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc, path = \'/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/article[1]/header/h2/a\', xmlValue)\n\nxpathSApply is a function available in the XML library in R. \nxmlValue is the argument we need to pass so that we get the value of the target node. \nIn our case its the heading of the article.\n\n<h3>Relative Path &#8211;</h3>\nWe can create a short and concise path to our target node by using &#8216;//\' to jump between nodes. \nFor example, the above absolute path can also be written as //h2/a. \nThis path also points to our target &#8216;a\' tag. \nThere can be other ways to represent this path as well. \nNow let us take a look at the command to extract the heading text.\n\nRelative XPath\n\nxpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2/a", xmlValue)[1]\n\nxpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2/a", xmlValue)[1]\n\nThe output is a character vector with 22 values in it. \nA snapshot of the output is provided below. \nHence we need to fetch the first text by using [1] in the command.\n\n<img class="lazy" src="https://www.opencodez.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Character-output-1024x598.png">\n\n<h3>Other ways to represent XPaths</h3>\n<h3>Wildcard Operator * &#8211;</h3>\nThe wildcard operator * matches any (single) node with an arbitrary name at its position. \nIn our case, a wildcard operated XPath will look like below.\n\nWildcard XPath\n\n(xpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2/*", xmlValue))[1]\n\n(xpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2/*", xmlValue))[1]\n\n<h3>Wildcard Operator . \nand .. \n&#8211;</h3>\nHere we are going to explain two more operators &#8216;.\' and &#8216;..\' and its usage in the XPath command. \nThe . \noperator selects the current nodes (or self-axis) in a selected node-set. \nThe .. \noperator selects the node one level up the hierarchy from the current node. \nLet us all try this for ourselves. \nDo share the commands or scenarios in the comments where any difficulty is faced.\n\n<h3>Numerical Predicate &#8211;</h3>\nSome predicates or functions can also be used to pinpoint nodes using position, last or count in the command. \nOur target node XPath will change in the below manner.\n\nNumerical Predicates\n\n#Position\nxpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2[position()=1]", xmlValue)[1]\n\n#Last\nxpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2[last()]", xmlValue)[1]\n\n#Count\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//h2[count(.//a)>0]", xmlValue)[1]\n\n#PositionxpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2[position()=1]", xmlValue)[1] #LastxpathSApply(doc = parsed_doc, path ="//h2[last()]", xmlValue)[1] #CountxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//h2[count(.//a)>0]", xmlValue)[1]\n\n<h4>Position &#8211;</h4>\nWe are trying to locate all the h2 tags which have got the first position in the node tree structure. \nAs explained earlier, this will generate a character of 22 values. \nOur &#8216;position\' command extracts the first value because of [1] in the command.\n\n<h4>Last &#8211;</h4>\nSimilar to the above, all the h2 tags which are last in the tree structure will be extracted. \nThe first value can be fetched using [1]. \nWe can experiment to fetch other article headings by changing the value inside the box bracket.\n\n<h4>Count &#8211;</h4>\nThe command looks a bit scary!! But don\'t be. \nIt simply extracts all the h2 nodes which have got &#8216;a\' tag present. \nIf we observe the &#8216;h2\' tags in the HTML code, we will notice that all the &#8216;h2\' tags do have a child tag &#821#8216;a\' and so this command is the same as the one we saw in the relative path section. \nWith the presence of [1], it allows us to fetch the first article heading text.\n\nIf you were facing issues working with the . \noperator command as suggested earlier, this example should provide you with some understanding.\n\n<h3>Text Predicate &#8211;</h3>\nWe can also locate some nodes with the manipulation of text related predicates. \nExplaining this will require a change in our target node. \nText predicates help us in cases where we want to extract text which contains a specific word or characters or let say has a length condition on characters. \nLet us see some commands.\n\n<h4>Contains &#8211;</h4>\n\nText Predicate\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//a[contains(text(), \'10\')]", xmlValue)\n\nlibrary(stringr)xpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//a[contains(text(), \'10\')]", xmlValue)\n\nThe above command will throw a list of headings that have got 10 in its text. \nThe output snapshot is provided below.\n\n<img class="lazy" src="https://www.opencodez.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10.png">\n\n<h4>Starts-with &#8211;</h4>\nWhen we want to fetch text of any attribute which starts with a particular string pattern, we can use starts-with predicate in the command. \nAttributes in any tag are addressed using &#8216;@\' symbol. \nHave a look at the command. \nDo try to understand the output for this and let us know if you face any difficulty.\n\nstarts-with\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//a[starts-with(./@title, \'10\')]", xmlValue)\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//a[starts-with(./@title, \'10\')]", xmlValue)\n\n<h3>XPath Node Relations &#8211;</h3>\nA very interesting way to prepare XPaths is by understanding the tree analogy of the nodes in the HTML code structure. \nAs is usual in describing tree-structured data formats, we employ notation based on family relationships (child, parent, grandparent, …) to describe the between-node relations. \nThe construction of a proper XPath statement that employs this feature follows the pattern node1/<i>relation</i>::node2, where node2 has a specific <i>relation</i> to node1. \n Let us see some examples.\n\n<h3>Ancestor &#8211;</h3>\nAncestor\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//a/ancestor::article", xmlValue)\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//a/ancestor::article", xmlValue)\n\nThe command locates and fetches all the article tags which are an ancestor to a tag.\n\n<h4>Child &#8211;</h4>\n\nChild\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//div[position()=1]/child::article", xmlValue)\n\nxpathSApply(parsed_doc,"//div[position()=1]/child::article", xmlValue)\n\nThe command locates and fetches all article tags which is a child of div tag in the first position in the tree structure.\n\nThere are many other such relations that we can utilize like a sibling, preceding-sibling, descendant, following, etc.\n\n<h3>Conclusion &#8211;</h3>\nI hope you found this step by step detailed guide on XPath for Web Scraping with R useful. \nThere are many more options with which we can create XPaths apart from the ones we have explained in this article.\n\nIt is encouraged that the reader tries these commands themselves to practice and gain a deeper understanding of a faster smoother experience with Web Scraping. \nDo comment if you want to understand any specific XPath command, if you face any error or you want to know about any other concept related to Web Scraping.\n',

'<h2>A basic plot</h2>\n# load data\nmanagers_energy = read.csv("managers_energy_data.csv")\nsimulation = read.csv("simulation.csv")\n\nNext, we\'ll make a basic ggplot. Compared to other plotting languages, ggplot syntax might seem weird at first. In ggplot, we build the plot one layer at a time. The first thing we do is create a blank canvas by calling the ggplot() command:\n\n# blank ggplot\nmanager_plot =  ggplot() \n\nThis creates a blank ggplot called manager_plot. To this canvas, we\'ll add different \'geometric objects\'. In ggplot notation, these geometric objects are called a geom. The geom tells ggplot how we want the data represented. To represent the data using points, we use geom_point. To represent the data using lines, we use geom_line, and so on. Here we\'ll use points:\n\n# basic ggplot syntax\nmanager_plot =  ggplot() + geom_point()\n\nThis is the basic syntax of a ggplot chart. We first evoke ggplot, and then add features to the plot using the + sign.\n\nNext we need to add data. Inside geom_point, we tell ggplot to use managers_energy as the source data:\n\n# add data\nmanager_plot =  ggplot() + geom_point(data = managers_energy)\n\nWe can also put the command data = managers_energy inside the ggplot() command, as in ggplot(data = managers_energy). Personally, I don\'t like to do this because my plots usually combine different datasets. Putting the data inside the ggplot() command locks the whole chart into using only that data.\n\nNext, we tell ggplot about the \'aesthetics\' we want, using the aes() command. We tell ggplot that the x-axis should plot energy_pc and the y-axis should plot managers_employment_share. This gives us the syntax for a basic ggplot:\n\n# basic plot of managers vs. energy use\nmanager_plot =  ggplot() + geom_point(data = managers_energy,\n                aes(x = energy_pc, y = managers_employment_share))\n\nRefining the chart\nThe secret to good data visualization, I\'ve found, is the refinements that come after you\'ve created a basic chart. These refinements highlight the aspects of the data that you want to showcase.\n\nFirst, let\'s refine the size of our data points. My philosophy is that the point size of scatter plots should vary inversely with the number of points. If you have only a few data observations, you want large points so you can see the data. But if you have many data observations (thousands or millions), you want to shrink the point size so that you can actually see all the data.\n\nIn our managers plot, we\'ve go quite a few data observations. So let\'s shrink the point size from the ggplot default. To do this, we\'ll put size = 0.8 inside geom_point. For reasons that I\'ll discuss later, this size command doesn\'t go inside the aesthetic command aes().\n\n# smaller point size\nmanager_plot = ggplot() +\n                geom_point( data = managers_energy,\n                size = 0.8,\n                aes(x = energy_pc, y = managers_employment_share))\n\nReducing the point size in our scatter plot gives us:\n\nfig_02_size\nSmaller point size\nThe next thing I notice about the plot is that the data is crushed against the origin. When you see this happen, it\'s a good sign that you need to use logarithmic scales. Log scales spread the data out so that we can see variation in all the observations, not just the largest ones.\n\nLet\'s tell ggplot to use logarithmic scales instead of linear scales:\n\n# add log scales\nmanager_plot =  manager_plot +\n                scale_x_log10() +\n                scale_y_log10()\n\nHere I\'m using an interesting feature of ggplot --- it let\'s you recursively add layers to your plot. Having defined manager_plot, we tell ggplot to change the axes by adding commands to the original plot. To be honest, I don\'t use this recursive feature very often. But it\'s useful here because I can highlight the new code that I\'ve adding with each refinement to the chart. Changing to log scales gives us:\n\nfig_03_log_scale\nAdd log scales\nNow the scatter plot looks much better. We can actually see the trend across countries.\n\nNext, let\'s tweek the values on the axes. When log scales span only a few orders of magnitude, I like to add numbers in between the factors of ten. To change the axis numbers, we use the breaks command. To make custom breaks, we use the concatenate command c(). If I wanted axis labels of 1, 5, and 10, I\'d write breaks = c(1, 5, 10). Here\'s the custom breaks that I\'ll use:\n\n# better axis breaks\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000)) +\n  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.1,0.2,0.5,1,2,5,10,20))\n\nThis gives a plot with better axis numbers:\n\nfig_04_breaks\nBetter axis breaks\nNext, let\'s fix our axis labels. By default, ggplot will use your variable names as the axis labels. This is rarely what you want in your final plot. To change the axis labels we use the command labs(). While we\'re at it, we\'ll add a title to the chart using ggtitle():\n\n# descriptive labels and title\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  labs(x = "Energy use per capita (GJ)",\n       y = "Managers (% of Total Employment)" ) +\n  ggtitle("Managers Employment vs. Energy Use")\n\nNow our plot has better labels:\n\nfig_05_labels\nDescriptive labels and title\nAdding simulation data\nTo our empirical data, we\'ll now add the simulation data. We\'re going to use one of the nicest features of ggplot: the ability to use color to represent changes in a variable. To do this, we put the color command inside the aesthetics, aes().\n\nIn our simulation, we want energy_pc on the x-axis, managers_employment_share on the y-axis, and span_of_control in color. To plot this using points, we write:\n\n#plot simulation data with span of control indicated by color\n  geom_point(data = simulation,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share,\n                 color = span_of_control)\n             ) \n \nThe logic here is that any aesthetic getting mapped onto variables goes inside the aes() command. If I wanted point size to be a function of the span_of_control, I would write:\n\n# point size as function of span of control\n  geom_point(data = simulation,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share,\n                 size = span_of_control)\n             ) \n\nBut if I want to set the size of points to a single value, this goes outside the aes() command.\n\n# point size has a single value\n  geom_point(data = simulation,\n             size = 0.1,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share,\n                 color = span_of_control)\n             ) \n\nLet\'s add the simulation data to our management plot. We want the simulation data to appear under the empirical data, so we have to add it to the ggplot before adding the empirical data.\n\nBecause we don\'t want the simulation data to overwhelm the empirical data, we\'re going to make the simulation data partially transparent. This makes it feel like it\'s in the background.\n\nIn ggplot, we set the transparency of our points using the alpha command. alpha = 0 is completely transparent. alpha = 1 is completely opaque. We\'ll add alpha = 0.3 inside our geom. Heres the code with the simulation data added to the empirical data, along with all the refinements so far:\n\n# add simulation data\nmanager_plot = ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = simulation,\n             size = 0.1,\n             alpha = 0.3,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share,\n                 color = span_of_control)\n             ) +\n  geom_point(data = managers_energy,\n             size = 0.8,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share)\n             ) +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000)) +\n  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.1,0.2,0.5,1,2,5,10,20)) +\n  labs(x = "Energy use per capita (GJ)",\n       y =  "Managers (% of Total Employment)") +\n  ggtitle("Managers Employment vs. Energy Use") \n\nThis code gives us:\n\nfig_06_simulation\nAdd simulation data\nMore refinements\nAfter adding the simulation data, we need to do more plot refining. First, the simulation data spans a far greater range than the empirical data. So now our empirical data is compressed into the corner of the chart. We don\'t want that.\n\nWe\'ll fix this by limiting the x-y range of the chart using the command coord_cartesian(). Inside the command we put the x and y range that we want. I\'ll restrict x to range from 5 to 1000 and y from 0.1 to 30. We use the concatenate function c() to denote these limits:\n\n# limit plot range\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(5,1000), ylim = c(0.1,30)) \n\nOur plot now looks like this:\n\nfig_07_cartesion\nLimit plot range\nNotice that ggplot has again used variable names to label the plot, this time for the color legend. We fix this using the labs() command. We want to label the color scale "Span of Control", so we write:\n\n# descriptive label for color legend  \nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  labs(color = "Span of Control")\n\nWe get:\n\nfig_08_span_label\nDescriptive label for color legend\nAdding the label creates a new problem. The label is too long and compresses the graph. To fix this, we add a line split to the label using /n:\n\n# line break in legend label\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  labs(color = "Span of/nControl")\n\nWe now get:\n\nfig_09_span_label_line\nLine break in legend label\nNow let\'s refine the colors used by ggplot to represent the span of control. By default, ggplot uses shades of blue. I prefer to use the whole color spectrum. To represent the span of control using a rainbow with 8 colors, we write:\n\n# rainbow colors for span of control\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  scale_color_gradientn( colours = rainbow(8) )\n\nNow the chart is starting to pop!\n\nfig_10_rainbow\nRainbow colors for span of control\nBut if we\'re picky (and we should be), we see that the rainbow on the color legend is upside down compared to the rainbow in the chart. Let\'s fix that by reversing the direction of the legend:\n\n# reverse color legend\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(8),\n                        guide = guide_colourbar(reverse = T))\n\nNow the legend and the chart have matching rainbows:\n\nfig_11_rainbow_reverse\nReverse direction of color legend\nThe plot theme\nThe default ggplot theme uses a grey background. We can change the theme using the theme command. I prefer the black and white theme, theme_bw():\n\n# black and white theme\nmanager_plot = manager_plot + theme_bw()\n\nOur plot now looks like this:\n\nfig_12_black_white\nBlack and white theme\nI also prefer serif fonts over sans-serif. Let\'s change the font to Times:\n\n# change font to Times\nmanager_plot = manager_plot +\n  theme(text=element_text(size = 10, family="Times"))\n\nOur chart is looking close to the final version:\n\nfig_13_times\nChange font to Times\nThe last thing we\'ll do is add my personal theme that I use for all my plots. This theme removes the grid lines and flips the tick marks to the inside of the plot box. It also centeres the plot title and makes it bold. Here\'s the code:\n\ntheme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size = rel(1), hjust = 0.5),\n      axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),\n      axis.title.x = element_text(vjust= 0, size=rel(0.9)),\n      axis.title.y = element_text(vjust= 1.1, size=rel(0.9)),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(margin=margin(5,5,0,0,"pt")),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(margin=margin(3,5,0,3,"pt")),\n      axis.ticks.length = unit(-0.7, "mm"),\n      text=element_text(size = 10, family="Times"))\n\nPutting all the steps together, here\'s the finished code for the graphic:\n\n# all code with custom theme\nmanager_plot = ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = simulation,\n             size = 0.1,\n             alpha = 0.3,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share,\n                 color = span_of_control)\n  ) +\n  geom_point(data = managers_energy,\n             size = 0.8,\n             aes(x = energy_pc,\n                 y = managers_employment_share)\n  ) +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000)) +\n  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.1,0.2,0.5,1,2,5,10,20)) +\n  labs(x = "Energy use per capita (GJ)",\n       y =  "Managers (% of Total Employment)",\n       color = "Span of /nControl") +\n  ggtitle("Managers Employment vs. Energy Use") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(5,1000), ylim = c(0.1,30)) +\n  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(8),\n                        guide=guide_colourbar(reverse = T) ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size = rel(1), hjust = 0.5),\n      axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),\n      axis.title.x = element_text(vjust= 0, size=rel(0.9)),\n      axis.title.y = element_text(vjust= 1.1, size=rel(0.9)),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(margin=margin(5,5,0,0,"pt")),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(margin=margin(3,5,0,3,"pt")),\n      axis.ticks.length = unit(-0.7, "mm"),\n      text=element_text(size = 10, family="Times"))\n\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0n_p7POzDE" class="whitebut ">ggplot youtube</a>\n',

'<h2>Parallel Computing</h2>\n<h3>Terminology</h3>\nLet’s just nail down some terminology.\n\nA <em>core</em> is a general term for either a single processor on your own computer (technically you only have one processor, but a modern processor like the i7 can have multiple cores - hence the term) or a single machine in a cluster network.\n\nA <em>cluster</em> is a collection of objecting capable of hosting cores, either a network or just the collection of cores on your personal computer.\n\nA <em>process</em> is a single running version of R (or more generally any program). \nEach core runs a single process.\n\n<h3>The <code>parallel</code> package</h3>\nThere are a number of packages which can be used for parallel processing in R. \nTwo of the earliest and strongest were <code>multicore</code> and <code>snow</code>. \nHowever, both were adopted in the base R installation and merged into the <code>parallel</code> package.\n\n<code>library(parallel)</code>\n\nYou can easily check the number of cores you have access to with <code>detectCores</code>:\n\n<code>detectCores()</code>\n\n<code>## [1] 4</code>\n\nThe number of cores represented is not neccessarily correlated with the number of processors you actually have thanks to the concept of "logical CPUs". \nFor the most part, you can use this number as accurate. \nTrying to use more cores than you have available won’t provide any benefit.\n\n<h3>Methods of Paralleization</h3>\nThere are two main ways in which code can be parallelized, via <em>sockets</em> or via <em>forking</em>. \nThese function slightly differently:\n\nThe <em>socket</em> approach launches a new version of R on each core. \nTechnically this connection is done via networking (e.g.&nbsp;the same as if you connected to a remote server), but the connection is happening all on your own computer<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I mention this because you may get a warning from your computer asking whether to allow R to accept incoming connections, you should allow it.\n\nThe <em>forking</em> approach copies the entire current version of R and moves it to a new core.\n\nThere are various pro’s and con’s to the two approaches:\n\nSocket:\n\nPro: Works on any system (including Windows).\n\nPro: Each process on each node is unique so it can’t cross-contaminate.\n\nCon: Each process is unique so it will be slower\n\nCon: Things such as package loading need to be done in each process separately. \nVariables defined on your main version of R don’t exist on each core unless explicitly placed there.\n\nCon: More complicated to implement.\n\nForking:\n\nCon: Only works on POSIX systems (Mac, Linux, Unix, BSD) and not Windows.\n\nCon: Because processes are duplicates, it can cause issues specifically with random number generation (which should usually be handled by <code>parallel</code> in the background) or when running in a GUI (such as RStudio). \nThis doesn’t come up often, but if you get odd behavior, this may be the case.\n\nPro: Faster than sockets.\n\nPro: Because it copies the existing version of R, your entire workspace exists in each process.\n\nPro: Trivially easy to implement.\n\nIn general, I’d recommend using forking if you’re not on Windows.\n\n<em>Note</em>: These notes were compiled on OS X.\n\n<h3>Forking with <code>mclapply</code></h3>\nThe most straightforward way to enable parallel processing is by switching from using <code>lapply</code> to <code>mclapply</code>. \n(Note I’m using <code>system.time</code> instead of <code>profvis</code> here because I only care about running time, not profiling.)\n\n<code>library(lme4)</code>\n\n<code>## Loading required package: Matrix</code>\n\n<code>f = function(i) {\n  lmer(Petal.Width ~ . \n- Species + (1 | Species), data = iris)\n}\n \nsystem.time(save1 = lapply(1:100, f))</code>\n\n<code>##    user  system elapsed \n##   2.048   0.019   2.084</code>\n\n<code>system.time(save2 = mclapply(1:100, f))</code>\n\n<code>##    user  system elapsed \n##   1.295   0.150   1.471</code>\n\nIf you were to run this code on Windows, <code>mclapply</code> would simply call <code>lapply</code>, so the code works but sees no speed gain.\n\n<code>mclapply</code> takes an argument, <code>mc.cores</code>. \nBy default, <code>mclapply</code> will use all cores available to it. \nIf you don’t want to (either becaues you’re on a shared system or you just want to save processing power for other purposes) you can set this to a value lower than the number of cores you have. \nSetting it to 1 disables parallel processing, and setting it higher than the number of available cores has no effect.\n\n<h3>Using sockets with <code>parLapply</code></h3>\nAs promised, the sockets approach to parallel processing is more complicated and a bit slower, but works on Windows systems. \nThe general process we’ll follow is\n',

'<h2>colorspace: Manipulating and Assessing Colors and Palettes</h2>\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorspace/vignettes/colorspace.html\nThe <em>colorspace</em> package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualizations.\n\nAt the core of the package there are various utilities for computing with color spaces (as the name conveys). \nThus, the package helps to map various three-dimensional representations of color to each other. \nA particularly important mapping is the one from the perceptually-based and device-independent color model HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) to standard Red-Green-Blue (sRGB) which is the basis for color specifications in many systems based on the corresponding hex codes (e.g., in HTML but also in R). \nFor completeness further standard color models are included as well in the package: <code>polarLUV()</code> (= HCL), <code>LUV()</code>, <code>polarLAB()</code>, <code>LAB()</code>, <code>XYZ()</code>, <code>RGB()</code>, <code>sRGB()</code>, <code>HLS()</code>, <code>HSV()</code>.\n\nThe HCL space (= polar coordinates in CIELUV) is particularly useful for specifying individual colors and color palettes as its three axes match those of the human visual system very well: Hue (= type of color, dominant wavelength), chroma (= colorfulness), luminance (= brightness).\n\nThe <em>colorspace</em> package provides three types of palettes based on the HCL model:\n\n<em>Qualitative:</em> Designed for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available and every color should receive the same perceptual weight. \nFunction: <code>qualitative_hcl()</code>.\n\n<em>Sequential:</em> Designed for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e., where colors go from high to low (or vice versa). \nFunction: <code>sequential_hcl()</code>.\n\n<em>Diverging:</em> Designed for coding ordered/numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes. \nFunction: <code>diverging_hcl()</code>.\n\nTo aid choice and application of these palettes there are: scales for use with <em>ggplot2</em>; <em>shiny</em> (and <em>tcltk</em>) apps for interactive exploration; visualizations of palette properties; accompanying manipulation utilities (like desaturation, lighten/darken, and emulation of color vision deficiencies).\n\nMore detailed overviews and

Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colorspace" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colorspace</a> and can be installed via\n\n<code>install.packages("colorspace")</code>\n\nThe development version of <em>colorspace</em> is hosted on R-Forge at <a href="https://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/colorspace/" class="uri">https://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/colorspace/</a> in a Subversion (SVN) repository. \nIt can be installed via\n\n<code>install.packages("colorspace", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")</code>\n\nFor Python users a beta re-implementation of the full <em>colorspace</em> package in Python 2/Python 3 is also available, see <a href="https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace" class="uri">https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace</a>.\n\n<h3>Choosing HCL-based color palettes</h3>\nThe <em>colorspace</em> package ships with a wide range of predefined color palettes, specified through suitable trajectories in the HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color space. \nA quick overview can be gained easily with the <code>hcl_palettes()</code> function:\n\n<code>library("colorspace")\nhcl_palettes(plot = TRUE)</code>\n\nA suitable vector of colors can be easily computed by specifying the desired number of colors and the palette name (see the plot above), e.g.,\n\n<code>q4 = qualitative_hcl(4, palette = "Dark 3")\nq4</code>\n\n<code>## [1] "#E16A86" "#909800" "#00AD9A" "#9183E6"</code>\n\nThe functions <code>sequential_hcl()</code>, and <code>diverging_hcl()</code> work analogously. \nAdditionally, their hue/chroma/luminance parameters can be modified, thus allowing for easy customization of each palette. \nMoreover, the <code>choose_palette()</code>/<code>hclwizard()</code> app provide convenient user interfaces to perform palette customization interactively. \nFinally, even more flexible diverging HCL palettes are provided by <code>divergingx_hcl()</code>.\n\n<h3>Usage with base graphics</h3>\nThe color vectors returned by the HCL palette functions can usually be passed directly to most base graphics function, typically through the <code>col</code> argument. \nHere, the <code>q4</code> vector created above is used in a time series display:\n\n<code>plot(log(EuStockMarkets), plot.type = "single", col = q4, lwd = 2)\nlegend("topleft", colnames(EuStockMarkets), col = q4, lwd = 3, bty = "n")</code>\n\nAs another example for a sequential palette, we demonstrate how to create a spine plot displaying the proportion of Titanic passengers that survived per class. \nThe <code>Purples 3</code> palette is used, which is quite similar to the <k>ColorBrewer.org</k> palette <code>Purples</code>. \nHere, only two colors are employed, yielding a dark purple and light gray.\n\n<code>ttnc = margin.table(Titanic, c(1, 4))[, 2:1]\nspineplot(ttnc, col = sequential_hcl(2, palette = "Purples 3"))</code>\n\n<h3>Usage with <em>ggplot2</em></h3>\nTo provide access to the HCL color palettes from within <em>ggplot2</em> graphics suitable discrete and/or continuous <em>gglot2</em> color scales are provided. \nThe scales are named via the scheme <code>scale_&lt;aesthetic>_&lt;datatype>_&lt;colorscale>()</code>, where <code>&lt;aesthetic></code> is the name of the aesthetic (<code>fill</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>colour</code>), <code>&lt;datatype></code> is the type of the variable plotted (<code>discrete</code> or <code>continuous</code>) and <code>&lt;colorscale></code> sets the type of the color scale used (<code>qualitative</code>, <code>sequential</code>, <code>diverging</code>, <code>divergingx</code>).\n\nTo illustrate their usage two simple examples are shown using the qualitative <code>Dark 3</code> and sequential <code>Purples 3</code> palettes that were also employed above. \nFor the first example, semi-transparent shaded densities of the sepal length from the iris data are shown, grouped by species.\n\n<code>library("ggplot2")\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3")</code>\n\nAnd for the second example the sequential palette is used to code the cut levels in a scatter of price by carat in the diamonds data (or rather a small subsample thereof). \nThe scale function first generates six colors but then drops the first color because the light gray is too light here. \n(Alternatively, the chroma and luminance parameters could also be tweaked.)\n\n<code>dsamp = diamonds[1 + 1:1000 * 50, ]\nggplot(dsamp, aes(carat, price, color = cut)) + geom_point() +\n  scale_color_discrete_sequential(palette = "Purples 3", nmax = 6, order = 2:6)</code>\n\n<h3>Palette visualization and assessment</h3>\nThe <em>colorspace</em> package also provides a number of functions that aid visualization and assessment of its palettes.\n\n<code>demoplot()</code> can display a palette (with arbitrary number of colors) in a range of typical and somewhat simplified statistical graphics.\n\n<code>hclplot()</code> converts the colors of a palette to the corresponding hue/chroma/luminance coordinates and displays them in HCL space with one dimension collapsed. \nThe collapsed dimension is the luminance for qualitative palettes and the hue for sequential/diverging palettes.\n\n<code>specplot()</code> also converts the colors to hue/chroma/luminance coordinates but draws the resulting spectrum in a line plot.\n\nFor the qualitative <code>Dark 3</code> palette from above the following plots can be obtained.\n\n<code>demoplot(q4, "bar")\nhclplot(q4)\nspecplot(q4, type = "o")</code>\n\nThe bar plot is used as a typical application for a qualitative palette (in addition to the time series and density plots used above). \nThe other two displays show that luminance is (almost) constant in the palette while the hue changes linearly along the color “wheel”. \nIdeally, chroma would have also been constant to completely balance the colors. \nHowever, at this luminance the maximum chroma differs across hues so that the palette is fixed up to use less chroma for the yellow and green elements.\n\nNote also that in a bar plot areas are shaded (and not just points or lines) so that lighter colors would be preferable. \nIn the density plot above this was achieved through semi-transparency. \nAlternatively, luminance could be increased as is done in the <code>"Pastel 1"</code> or <code>"Set 3"</code> palettes.\n\nSubsequently, the same types of assessment are carried out for the sequential <code>"Purples 3"</code> palette as employed above.\n\n<code>s9 = sequential_hcl(9, "Purples 3")\ndemoplot(s9, "heatmap")\nhclplot(s9)\nspecplot(s9, type = "o")</code>\n\nHere, a heatmap (based on the well-known Maunga Whau volcano data) is used as a typical application for a sequential palette. \nThe elevation of the volcano is brought out clearly, using dark colors to give emphasis to higher elevations.\n\nThe other two displays show that hue is constant in the palette while luminance and chroma vary. \nLuminance increases monotonically from dark to light (as required for a proper sequential palette). \nChroma is triangular-shaped which allows to better distinguish the middle colors in the palette when compared to a monotonic chroma trajectory.\n',

'<h2>Creating dummies for categorical variables</h2>\nIn situations where we have categorical variables (factors) but need to use them in analytical methods that require numbers (for example, <span class="orange">K nearest neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression</span>), we need to create dummy variables.\n\nA <code>dummy variable</code> is a numeric interpretation of the category or level of the factor variable.\nThat is, it represents every group or level of the categorical variable as a single numeric entity.\n\nRead the <code>data-conversion.csv</code> file and store it in the working directory of your R environment. Install the <code>dummies</code> package. Then read the data:\n<code>\ninstall.packages("dummies")\nlibrary(dummies)\nstudents = read.csv("data-conversion.csv")</code>\n\nCreate dummies for all factors in the data frame:\n<code>students.new = dummy.data.frame(students, sep = ".")\nnames(students.new)\n\n[1] "Age"      "State.NJ" "State.NY" "State.TX" "State.VA"\n[6] "Gender.F" "Gender.M" "Height"   "Income"</code>\nThe <code>students.new</code> data frame now contains all the original variables and the newly added dummy variables. The <code>dummy.data.frame()</code> function has created dummy variables for all four levels of the <code>State</code> and two levels of <code>Gender</code> factors. However, we will generally omit one of the dummy variables for <code>State</code> and one for <code>Gender</code> when we use machine-learning techniques.\nWe can use the optional argument <code>all = FALSE</code> to specify that the resulting data frame should contain only the generated dummy variables and none of the original variables.\n\n<h3>How it works...</h3>\nThe <code>dummy.data.frame()</code> function creates dummies for all the factors in the data frame supplied. Internally, it uses another <code>dummy()</code> function which creates dummy variables for a single factor. The <code>dummy()</code> function creates one new variable for every level of the factor for which we are creating dummies. It appends the variable name with the factor level name to generate names for the dummy variables. We can use the <code>sep</code> argument to specify the character that separates them—an empty string is the default:\n\n<code>dummy(students$State, sep = ".")\n\n      State.NJ State.NY State.TX State.VA\n [1,]        1        0        0        0\n [2,]        0        1        0        0\n [3,]        1        0        0        0\n [4,]        0        0        0        1\n [5,]        0        1        0        0\n [6,]        0        0        1        0\n [7,]        1        0        0        0\n [8,]        0        0        0        1\n [9,]        0        0        1        0\n[10,]        0        0        0        1</code>\n\n<h3>There\'s more...</h3>\nIn situations where a data frame has several factors, and you plan on using only a subset of these, you will create dummies only for the chosen subset.\n<h4>Choosing which variables to create dummies for</h4>\nTo create dummies only for one variable or a subset of variables, we can use the <code>names</code> argument to specify the column names of the variables we want dummies for:\n\n<code>students.new1 = dummy.data.frame(students, names = c("State","Gender") , sep = ".")</code>\n',
'<h2>How to Create dummy variables in R</h2>\n<h3>Why do we need dummy variables in R?</h3>\nLet us first understand the concept of dummy variables. \nConsider a dataset that represents some categorical data values.\n\nHandling such a huge number of categories and groups is a cumbersome task for the <a href="https://www.journaldev.com/48036/machine-learning-in-r-introduction">machine learning model</a>. \nThus arises the need to treat categorical or level entries.\n\nThis is when the concept of dummy entries comes into picture.\n\nA <code>dummy variable</code> is a numeric interpretation of the category or level of the factor variable. \nThat is, it represents every group or level of the categorical variable as a single numeric entity.\n\nFor example, consider a data set that contains a variable &#8216;Poll\' with values &#8216;Yes\' and &#8216;No\'. \nNow, in order to represent the two groups as numeric entries, we can create dummies of the same.\n\nSo, the transformed dataset would now have two more additional columns as &#8216;Poll.1\' which would represent &#8216;yes\' type values (would assign 1 to all the data rows that are associated with level yes) and &#8216;Poll.2\' for &#8216;No\' type values.\n\n<h3>R fast.dummies library to create dummy variables</h3>\nR provides us with <b>fast.dummies</b> library that contains of dummy_cols() function for the creation of dummy variables at ease.\n\nWith <code>dummy_cols()</code> function, one can select the variables for whom the dummies need to be created.\n\n<b>Syntax:</b>\n\ndummy_cols(data, select_columns = \'columns\')</code>\n\n<b>Example:</b>\n\nIn this example, we have made use of the Bank Load Defaulter dataset. \nYou can find the dataset <a href="https://github.com/Safa1615/Dataset--loan/blob/main/bank-loan.csv">here</a>.\n\nFurther, we have made use of dummy_cols() function to create dummy variables for the column &#8216;ed\'.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n \n#install.packages(\'fastDummies\')\nlibrary(\'fastDummies\')\ndta = read.csv("bank-loan.csv",header=TRUE)\ndim(dta)\ndum = dummy_cols(dta, select_columns = \'ed\')\ndim(dum)\n\n</code>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\nAs witnessed below, the initial number of columns of the data set equals to 9. \nPost creation of dummy variables, the number of columns equals to 14.\n\nAll the 5 levels of the ed variable has been segregated as a separate column. \nOnly those rows which belongs to a certain category are set as 1, rest all values are set to zero(0).\n\n> dim(dta)\n&#91;1] 850   9\n\n> dim(dum)\n&#91;1] 850  14\n</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.journaldev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Creation-of-dummies-using-fastDummies-library.png">\n\nWhat if we need to create dummies for multiple variables in a single shot or at once?\n\nWell, we can then create a list of all the variables for which we need dummies using <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">c() function</a> and pass them as arguments through select_columns.\n\n<b>Example:</b>\n\nrm(list = ls())\n \n#install.packages(\'fastDummies\')\nlibrary(\'fastDummies\')\ndta = read.csv("bank-loan.csv",header=TRUE)\ndim(dta)\ndum = dummy_cols(dta, select_columns = c(\'ed\',\'default\'))\ndim(dum)\n\n</code>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\nHere, we have created dummies for both &#8216;ed\' and &#8216;default\' data columns.\n\n> dim(dta)\n&#91;1] 850   9\n> dum = dummy_cols(dta, select_columns = c(\'ed\',\'default\'))\n> dim(dum)\n&#91;1] 850  17\n</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.journaldev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Creation-of-dummies-for-multiple-columns.png">\n\n<h3>R dummies library to create dummy variables</h3>\nR <b>dummies </b>library can also be used to create dummy data variables for the categorical data columns at ease.\n\nFor the same, we can make use of <code>dummy()</code> function that enables us to create dummy entries for selected columns.\n\n<b>Example:</b>\n\nIn the below example, we have created dummy variables of the column &#8216;ed\' using dummy() function.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\nlibrary(\'dummies\')\ndta = read.csv("bank-loan.csv",header=TRUE)\ndim(dta)\ndum = dummy(dta$ed)\ndim(dum)\n\n</code>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\nAs seen below, all the levels have been segregated as a different column.\n\nAlso, only those data rows that match to the particular level is set to 1 in the column else it is represented as zero.\n\nFor example, if the data represents the level &#8216;ed1\', then it is set to 1 else it is set to 0.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.journaldev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Creation-of-dummies-using-dummies-library.png">\n',
'<h2>Build your own neural network classifier</h2>\n<h3><U+200B>Introduction</h3>\nImage classification is one important field in Computer Vision, not only because so many applications are associated with it, but also a lot of Computer Vision problems can be effectively reduced to image classification. \nThe state of art tool in image classification is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). \nIn this article, I am going to write a simple Neural Network with 2 layers (fully connected). \nI will first train it to classify a set of 4-class 2D data and visualize the decision boundary. \nSecond, I am going to train my NN with the famous MNIST data (you can download it here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/download/train.csv" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/download/train.csv</a>) and see its performance. \nThe first part is inspired by CS 231n course offered by Stanford: <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/" rel="noopener nofollow">http://cs231n.github.io/</a>, which is taught in Python.\n\n<h3><U+200B>Data set generation</h3>\nFirst, let’s create a spiral dataset with 4 classes and 200 examples each.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(caret)\n \nN <- 200 #

'<h2>Exploratory data analysis</h2>\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. \n\nIt helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.\n\nEDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. \n\nExploratory data analysis tools\nSpecific statistical functions and techniques you can perform with EDA tools include:\n\nClustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.\n\nUnivariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.\n\nBivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable you’re looking at.\n\nMultivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.\n\nK-means Clustering is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data points are assigned into K groups, i.e. the number of clusters, based on the distance from each group’s centroid. \n\nThe data points closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category. \n\nK-means Clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.\n\nPredictive models, such as linear regression, use statistics and data to predict outcomes.\n\nTypes of exploratory data analysis\nThere are four primary types of EDA:\n\nUnivariate non-graphical. \nThis is simplest form of data analysis, where the data being analyzed consists of just one variable. \nSince it’s a single variable, it doesn’t deal with causes or relationships. \n\nThe main purpose of univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.\n\nUnivariate graphical. \nNon-graphical methods don’t provide a full picture of the data. \nGraphical methods are therefore required. \n\nCommon types of univariate graphics include:\n\nStem-and-leaf plots, which show all data values and the shape of the distribution.\n\nHistograms, a bar plot in which each bar represents the frequency (count) or proportion (count/total count) of cases for a range of values.\n\nBox plots, which graphically depict the five-number summary of minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.\nMultivariate nongraphical: Multivariate data arises from more than one variable. \n\nMultivariate non-graphical EDA techniques generally show the relationship between two or more variables of the data through cross-tabulation or statistics.\n\nMultivariate graphical: Multivariate data uses graphics to display relationships between two or more sets of data. \n\nThe most used graphic is a grouped bar plot or bar chart with each group representing one level of one of the variables and each bar within a group representing the levels of the other variable.\n\nOther common types of multivariate graphics include:\n\nScatter plot, which is used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis to show how much one variable is affected by another.\n\nMultivariate chart, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between factors and a response.\n\nRun chart, which is a line graph of data plotted over time.\nBubble chart, which is a data visualization that displays multiple circles (bubbles) in a two-dimensional plot.\n\nHeat map, which is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by color.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis Tools\n\nSome of the most common data science tools used to create an EDA include:\n\nPython: An interpreted, object-oriented programming language with dynamic semantics. \nIts high-level, built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. \n\nPython and EDA can be used together to identify missing values in a data set, which is important so you can decide how to handle missing values for machine learning.\n\nR: An open-source programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. \n\nThe R language is widely used among statisticians in data science in developing statistical observations and data analysis.\n',

if you measure any continuous variable twice, you will get two different results. \nThis is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light. \nEach of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. \nCategorical variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g. the eye colors of different people), or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments).\nEvery variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information. \nThe best way to understand that pattern is to visualise the distribution of the variable’s values.\n\n<h3>Visualising distributions</h3>\nHow you visualise the distribution of a variable will depend on whether the variable is categorical or continuous. \nA variable is <k>categorical</k> if it can only take one of a small set of values. \nIn R, categorical variables are usually saved as factors or character vectors. \nTo examine the distribution of a categorical variable, use a bar chart:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7f4cb432b8891f01b8097e31f286cb54d7473ced/02c81/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png">\nThe height of the bars displays how many observations occurred with each x value. \nYou can compute these values manually with <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html">dplyr::count()</a></code>:\n\n<code>diamonds %>% \n  count(cut)\n#> # A tibble: 5 x 2\n#>   cut           n\n#>   &lt;ord>     &lt;int>\n#> 1 Fair       1610\n#> 2 Good       4906\n#> 3 Very Good 12082\n#> 4 Premium   13791\n#> 5 Ideal     21551</code>\nA variable is <k>continuous</k> if it can take any of an infinite set of ordered values. \nNumbers and date-times are two examples of continuous variables. \nTo examine the distribution of a continuous variable, use a histogram:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/832184b1db9d6bca2080fa526b7d791f77d37b8f/880fa/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png">\nYou can compute this by hand by combining <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html">dplyr::count()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/cut_interval.html">ggplot2::cut_width()</a></code>:\n\n<code>diamonds %>% \n  count(cut_width(carat, 0.5))\n#> # A tibble: 11 x 2\n#>   \ncut_width(carat, 0.5)\n     n\n#>   &lt;fct>                   &lt;int>\n#> 1 [-0.25,0.25]              785\n#> 2 (0.25,0.75]             29498\n#> 3 (0.75,1.25]             15977\n#> 4 (1.25,1.75]              5313\n#> 5 (1.75,2.25]              2002\n#> 6 (2.25,2.75]               322\n#> # … with 5 more rows</code>\nA histogram divides the x-axis into equally spaced bins and then uses the height of a bar to display the number of observations that fall in each bin. \nIn the graph above, the tallest bar shows that almost 30,000 observations have a <code>carat</code> value between 0.25 and 0.75, which are the left and right edges of the bar.\n\nYou can set the width of the intervals in a histogram with the <code>binwidth</code> argument, which is measured in the units of the <code>x</code> variable. \nYou should always explore a variety of binwidths when working with histograms, as different binwidths can reveal different patterns. \nFor example, here is how the graph above looks when we zoom into just the diamonds with a size of less than three carats and choose a smaller binwidth.\n\n<code>smaller = diamonds %>% \n  <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a>(carat &lt; 3)\n  \nggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2f4885ec2541f7490d6504d1e4c2d2707b7cd8d5/b5df8/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png">\nIf you wish to overlay multiple histograms in the same plot, I recommend using <code>geom_freqpoly()</code> instead of <code>geom_histogram()</code>. \n<code>geom_freqpoly()</code> performs the same calculation as <code>geom_histogram()</code>, but instead of displaying the counts with bars, uses lines instead. \nIt’s much easier to understand overlapping lines than bars.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) +\n  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/73b1aa01f56fdebb5829f8bb9efefd2d424165dd/0799c/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png">\nThere are a few challenges with this type of plot, which we will come back to in <a href="exploratory-data-analysis.html#cat-cont">visualising a categorical and a continuous variable</a>.\n\nNow that you can visualise variation, what should you look for in your plots? And what type of follow-up questions should you ask? I’ve put together a list below of the most useful types of information that you will find in your graphs, along with some follow-up questions for each type of information. \nThe key to asking good follow-up questions will be to rely on your curiosity (What do you want to learn more about?) as well as your skepticism (How could this be misleading?).\n\n<h3>Typical values</h3>\nIn both bar charts and histograms, tall bars show the common values of a variable, and shorter bars show less-common values. \nPlaces that do not have bars reveal values that were not seen in your data. \nTo turn this information into useful questions, look for anything unexpected:\n\nWhich values are the most common? Why?\n\nWhich values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?\n\nCan you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?\n\nAs an example, the histogram below suggests several interesting questions:\n\nWhy are there more diamonds at whole carats and common fractions of carats?\n\nWhy are there more diamonds slightly to the right of each peak than there\nare slightly to the left of each peak?\n\nWhy are there no diamonds bigger than 3 carats?\n\n<code>ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d4853921e3a2dbbac40b7b4ff2f138f0766b1f82/c7f2a/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png">\n# \nsmaller <- diamonds %>% filter(carat < 3)\n\nggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)\n\n# same result:\nindex = diamonds$carat < 3\nsmaller1 <- diamonds[index,]\nbarplot(table(smaller1$carat))\ncut_interval(smaller1$carat, n = NULL, length = 0.01)\nbarplot(table(cut_interval(smaller1$carat, n = NULL, length = 0.02)))\n\ngeom_freqpoly() performs the same calculation as geom_histogram(), but uses lines instead. \n\nggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)\n\nClusters of similar values suggest that subgroups exist in your data. \nTo understand the subgroups, ask:\n\nHow are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?\n\nHow are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?\n\nHow can you explain or describe the clusters?\n\nWhy might the appearance of clusters be misleading?\n\nThe histogram below shows the length (in minutes) of 272 eruptions of the Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park. \nEruption times appear to be clustered into two groups: there are short eruptions (of around 2 minutes) and long eruptions (4-5 minutes), but little in between.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aaa1365ef32c8038eab5a48634c2f78274ab1386/7b1be/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png">\nMany of the questions above will prompt you to explore a relationship <em>between</em> variables, for example, to see if the values of one variable can explain the behavior of another variable. \nWe’ll get to that shortly.\n\n<h3>Unusual values</h3>\nOutliers are observations that are unusual; data points that don’t seem to fit the pattern. \nSometimes outliers are data entry errors; other times outliers suggest important new science. \nWhen you have a lot of data, outliers are sometimes difficult to see in a histogram. \nFor example, take the distribution of the <code>y</code> variable from the diamonds dataset. \nThe only evidence of outliers is the unusually wide limits on the x-axis.\n\n<code>ggplot(diamonds) + \n  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e6b7f3c6684eff5146e447bc122ca4ed032aec87/08e60/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png">\nThere are so many observations in the common bins that the rare bins are so short that you can’t see them (although maybe if you stare intently at 0 you’ll spot something). \nTo make it easy to see the unusual values, we need to zoom to small values of the y-axis with <code>coord_cartesian()</code>:\n\n<code>ggplot(diamonds) + \n  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a>(0, 50))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0d4e86fd0fb0909eae2ea1df2e703feaa1732297/d1e5d/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png">\n(<code>coord_cartesian()</code> also has an <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">xlim()</a></code> argument for when you need to zoom into the x-axis. \nggplot2 also has <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">xlim()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">ylim()</a></code> functions that work slightly differently: they throw away the data outside the limits.)\n\nThis allows us to see that there are three unusual values: 0, ~30, and ~60. \nWe pluck them out with dplyr:\n\n<code>unusual = diamonds %>% \n  <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a>(y &lt; 3 | y > 20) %>% \n  select(price, x, y, z) %>%\n  arrange(y)\nunusual\n#> # A tibble: 9 x 4\n#>   price     x     y     z\n#>   &lt;int> &lt;dbl> &lt;dbl> &lt;dbl>\n#> 1  5139  0      0    0   \n#> 2  6381  0      0    0   \n#> 3 12800  0      0    0   \n#> 4 15686  0      0    0   \n#> 5 18034  0      0    0   \n#> 6  2130  0      0    0   \n#> 7  2130  0      0    0   \n#> 8  2075  5.15  31.8  5.12\n#> 9 12210  8.09  58.9  8.06</code>\nThe <code>y</code> variable measures one of the three dimensions of these diamonds, in mm. \nWe know that diamonds can’t have a width of 0mm, so these values must be incorrect. \nWe might also suspect that measurements of 32mm and 59mm are implausible: those diamonds are over an inch long, but don’t cost hundreds of thousands of dollars!\n\nIt’s good practice to repeat your analysis with and without the outliers. \nIf they have minimal effect on the results, and you can’t figure out why they’re there, it’s reasonable to replace them with missing values, and move on. \nHowever, if they have a substantial effect on your results, you shouldn’t drop them without justification. \nYou’ll need to figure out what caused them (e.g. a data entry error) and disclose that you removed them in your write-up.\n\n<h3>Exercises</h3>\nExplore the distribution of each of the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> variables\nin <code>diamonds</code>. \nWhat do you learn? Think about a diamond and how you\nmight decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.\n\nExplore the distribution of <code>price</code>. \nDo you discover anything unusual\nor surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the <code>binwidth</code> and make sure\nyou try a wide range of values.)\n\nHow many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What\ndo you think is the cause of the difference?\n\nCompare and contrast <code>coord_cartesian()</code> vs <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">xlim()</a></code> or <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">ylim()</a></code> when\nzooming in on a histogram. \nWhat happens if you leave <code>binwidth</code> unset?\nWhat happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?\n\n<h3>Missing values</h3>\nIf you’ve encountered unusual values in your dataset, and simply want to move on to the rest of your analysis, you have two options.\n\nDrop the entire row with the strange values:\n\n<code>diamonds2 = diamonds %>% \n  <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a>(between(y, 3, 20))</code>\nI don’t recommend this option because just because one measurement\nis invalid, doesn’t mean all the measurements are. \nAdditionally, if you\nhave low quality data, by time that you’ve applied this approach to every\nvariable you might find that you don’t have any data left!\n\nInstead, I recommend replacing the unusual values with missing values.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use <code>mutate()</code> to replace the variable\nwith a modified copy. \nYou can use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> function to replace\nunusual values with <code>NA</code>:\n\n<code>diamonds2 = diamonds %>% \n  mutate(y = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse</a>(y &lt; 3 | y > 20, NA, y))</code>\n\n<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> has three arguments. \nThe first argument <code>test</code> should be a logical vector. \nThe result will contain the value of the second argument, <code>yes</code>, when <code>test</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, and the value of the third argument, <code>no</code>, when it is false. \nAlternatively to ifelse, use <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html">dplyr::case_when()</a></code>. \n<code>case_when()</code> is particularly useful inside mutate when you want to create a new variable that relies on a complex combination of existing variables.\n\nLike R, ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing. \nIt’s not obvious where you should plot missing values, so ggplot2 doesn’t include them in the plot, but it does warn that they’ve been removed:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds2, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n  geom_point()\n#> Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0567235adf6a020b121e8bbbb68aca6c3ec757e1/4bb0c/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png">\nTo suppress that warning, set <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds2, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)</code>\nOther times you want to understand what makes observations with missing values different to observations with recorded values. \nFor example, in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/nycflights13/man/flights.html">nycflights13::flights</a></code>, missing values in the <code>dep_time</code> variable indicate that the flight was cancelled. \nSo you might want to compare the scheduled departure times for cancelled and non-cancelled times. \nYou can do this by making a new variable with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/NA.html">is.na()</a></code>.\n\n<code>nycflights13::<a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/nycflights13/man/flights.html">flights</a> %>% \n  mutate(\n    cancelled = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/NA.html">is.na</a>(dep_time),\n    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,\n    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,\n    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60\n  ) %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(sched_dep_time)) + \n    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = cancelled), binwidth = 1/4)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3b39886be0ed133839461341db7faeb7420c7942/2b3e3/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png">\nHowever this plot isn’t great because there are many more non-cancelled flights than cancelled flights. \nIn the next section we’ll explore some techniques for improving this comparison.\n\n<h3>Exercises</h3>\nWhat happens to missing values in a histogram? What happens to missing\nvalues in a bar chart? Why is there a difference?\n\nWhat does <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> do in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sum.html">sum()</a></code>?\n\n<h3>Covariation</h3>\nIf variation describes the behavior <em>within</em> a variable, covariation describes the behavior <em>between</em> variables. \n<k>Covariation</k> is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. \nThe best way to spot covariation is to visualise the relationship between two or more variables. \nHow you do that should again depend on the type of variables involved.\n\n<h3>A categorical and continuous variable</h3>\nIt’s common to want to explore the distribution of a continuous variable broken down by a categorical variable, as in the previous frequency polygon. \nThe default appearance of <code>geom_freqpoly()</code> is not that useful for that sort of comparison because the height is given by the count. \nThat means if one of the groups is much smaller than the others, it’s hard to see the differences in shape. \nFor example, let’s explore how the price of a diamond varies with its quality:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) + \n  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e1fa3645c501327ca1dd355d1a58e4b5dd5ae395/175af/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png">\nIt’s hard to see the difference in distribution because the overall counts differ so much:\n\n<code>ggplot(diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8eef08495f22577681edeb581899317bcae342de/0dc3d/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png">\nTo make the comparison easier we need to swap what is displayed on the y-axis. \nInstead of displaying count, we’ll display <k>density</k>, which is the count standardised so that the area under each frequency polygon is one.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, y = ..density..)) + \n  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f9865bcc8f3f3b4213c6356cf214f11be754e3c7/4a632/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png">\nThere’s something rather surprising about this plot - it appears that fair diamonds (the lowest quality) have the highest average price! But maybe that’s because frequency polygons are a little hard to interpret - there’s a lot going on in this plot.\n\nAnother alternative to display the distribution of a continuous variable broken down by a categorical variable is the boxplot. \nA <k>boxplot</k> is a type of visual shorthand for a distribution of values that is popular among statisticians. \nEach boxplot consists of:\n\nA box that stretches from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the\n75th percentile, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR). \nIn the\nmiddle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e. 50th percentile,\nof the distribution. \nThese three lines give you a sense of the spread of the\ndistribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the\nmedian or skewed to one side.\n\nVisual points that display observations that fall more than 1.5 times the\nIQR from either edge of the box. \nThese outlying points are unusual\nso are plotted individually.\n\nA line (or whisker) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the\n\nfarthest non-outlier point in the distribution.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/153b9af53b33918353fda9b691ded68cd7f62f51/5b616/images/eda-boxplot.png">\nLet’s take a look at the distribution of price by cut using <code>geom_boxplot()</code>:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +\n  geom_boxplot()</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dd32748293488cb51f7ca92587c4c8745c5855c0/9dcb3/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png">\nWe see much less information about the distribution, but the boxplots are much more compact so we can more easily compare them (and fit more on one plot). \nIt supports the counterintuitive finding that better quality diamonds are cheaper on average! In the exercises, you’ll be challenged to figure out why.\n\n<code>cut</code> is an ordered factor: fair is worse than good, which is worse than very good and so on. \nMany categorical variables don’t have such an intrinsic order, so you might want to reorder them to make a more informative display. \nOne way to do that is with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/reorder.factor.html">reorder()</a></code> function.\n\nFor example, take the <code>class</code> variable in the <code>mpg</code> dataset. \nYou might be interested to know how highway mileage varies across classes:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_boxplot()</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9d74715c7564aa5b82548d56f35a55ffa8f845ed/463c0/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png">\nTo make the trend easier to see, we can reorder <code>class</code> based on the median value of <code>hwy</code>:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = mpg) +\n  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/reorder.factor.html">reorder</a>(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ef621dd0d8904e2091d1ed7db8553d90f89f33a5/29adc/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png">\nIf you have long variable names, <code>geom_boxplot()</code> will work better if you flip it 90°. \nYou can do that with <code>coord_flip()</code>.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = mpg) +\n  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/reorder.factor.html">reorder</a>(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +\n  coord_flip()</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46d22e252c5cc27cebbd2568030ac57be1e53ef9/f34fd/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png">\n\n<h4>Exercises</h4>\n\nUse what you’ve learned to improve the visualisation of the departure times\nof cancelled vs. \nnon-cancelled flights.\n\nWhat variable in the diamonds dataset is most important for predicting\nthe price of a diamond? How is that variable correlated with cut?\nWhy does the combination of those two relationships lead to lower quality\ndiamonds being more expensive?\n\nInstall the ggstance package, and create a horizontal boxplot.\nHow does this compare to using <code>coord_flip()</code>?\n\nOne problem with boxplots is that they were developed in an era of\nmuch smaller datasets and tend to display a prohibitively large\nnumber of “outlying values”. \nOne approach to remedy this problem is\nthe letter value plot. \nInstall the lvplot package, and try using\n<code>geom_lv()</code> to display the distribution of price vs cut. \nWhat\ndo you learn? How do you interpret the plots?\n\nCompare and contrast <code>geom_violin()</code> with a facetted <code>geom_histogram()</code>,\nor a coloured <code>geom_freqpoly()</code>. \nWhat are the pros and cons of each\nmethod?\n\nIf you have a small dataset, it’s sometimes useful to use <code>geom_jitter()</code>\nto see the relationship between a continuous and categorical variable.\nThe ggbeeswarm package provides a number of methods similar to\n<code>geom_jitter()</code>. \nList them and briefly describe what each one does.\n\n<h3>Two categorical variables</h3>\nTo visualise the covariation between categorical variables, you’ll need to count the number of observations for each combination. \nOne way to do that is to rely on the built-in <code>geom_count()</code>:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7b7010bda735b55f17db8d3afffacd63b833d147/12920/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png">\nThe size of each circle in the plot displays how many observations occurred at each combination of values. \nCovariation will appear as a strong correlation between specific x values and specific y values.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the count with dplyr:\n\n<code>diamonds %>% \n  count(color, cut)\n#> # A tibble: 35 x 3\n#>   color cut           n\n#>   &lt;ord> &lt;ord>     &lt;int>\n#> 1 D     Fair        163\n#> 2 D     Good        662\n#> 3 D     Very Good  1513\n#> 4 D     Premium    1603\n#> 5 D     Ideal      2834\n#> 6 E     Fair        224\n#> # … with 29 more rows</code>\nThen visualise with <code>geom_tile()</code> and the fill aesthetic:\n\n<code>diamonds %>% \n  count(color, cut) %>%  \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +\n    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6076a5cc3814716d72982f5025c9a9fcfe271135/d09ef/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png">\nIf the categorical variables are unordered, you might want to use the seriation package to simultaneously reorder the rows and columns in order to more clearly reveal interesting patterns. \nFor larger plots, you might want to try the d3heatmap or heatmaply packages, which create interactive plots.\n\n<h4>Exercises</h4>\n\nHow could you rescale the count dataset above to more clearly show\nthe distribution of cut within colour, or colour within cut?\n\nUse <code>geom_tile()</code> together with dplyr to explore how average flight\ndelays vary by destination and month of year. \nWhat makes the\nplot difficult to read? How could you improve it?\n\nWhy is it slightly better to use <code>aes(x = color, y = cut)</code> rather\nthan <code>aes(x = cut, y = color)</code> in the example above?\n\n<h3>Two continuous variables</h3>\nYou’ve already seen one great way to visualise the covariation between two continuous variables: draw a scatterplot with <code>geom_point()</code>. \nYou can see covariation as a pattern in the points. \nFor example, you can see an exponential relationship between the carat size and price of a diamond.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fce2e7b428f14530f408483742ecd32043598796/21088/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png">\nScatterplots become less useful as the size of your dataset grows, because points begin to overplot, and pile up into areas of uniform black (as above).\nYou’ve already seen one way to fix the problem: using the <code>alpha</code> aesthetic to add transparency.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 1 / 100)</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fec521e4f29a7d938da5f243cf3e1cd8d8a514ec/344ef/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png">\nBut using transparency can be challenging for very large datasets. \nAnother solution is to use bin. \nPreviously you used <code>geom_histogram()</code> and <code>geom_freqpoly()</code> to bin in one dimension. \nNow you’ll learn how to use <code>geom_bin2d()</code> and <code>geom_hex()</code> to bin in two dimensions.\n\n<code>geom_bin2d()</code> and <code>geom_hex()</code> divide the coordinate plane into 2d bins and then use a fill color to display how many points fall into each bin. \n<code>geom_bin2d()</code> creates rectangular bins. \n<code>geom_hex()</code> creates hexagonal bins. \nYou will need to install the hexbin package to use <code>geom_hex()</code>.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = smaller) +\n  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))\n\n# install.packages("hexbin")\nggplot(data = smaller) +\n  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bd8faa5a44198b42b39eb84a94a8aa9090723aec/9a45f/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png">\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/48c515b1c463019bf93e32b648beeea37d848911/dc464/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-2.png">\n\nAnother option is to bin one continuous variable so it acts like a categorical variable. \nThen you can use one of the techniques for visualising the combination of a categorical and a continuous variable that you learned about. \nFor example, you could bin <code>carat</code> and then for each group, display a boxplot:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + \n  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6a7c21b0a75c6cd54a707e6be1190559e1780dfe/97fb8/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png">\n<code>cut_width(x, width)</code>, as used above, divides <code>x</code> into bins of width <code>width</code>. \nBy default, boxplots look roughly the same (apart from number of outliers) regardless of how many observations there are, so it’s difficult to tell that each boxplot summarises a different number of points. \nOne way to show that is to make the width of the boxplot proportional to the number of points with <code>varwidth = TRUE</code>.\n\nAnother approach is to display approximately the same number of points in each bin. \nThat’s the job of <code>cut_number()</code>:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + \n  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20)))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/85b4b0538dc988dcf6ad4fb5c64ef5a45d286ea5/82b02/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png">\n\n<h4>Exercises</h4>\n\nInstead of summarising the conditional distribution with a boxplot, you\ncould use a frequency polygon. \nWhat do you need to consider when using\n<code>cut_width()</code> vs <code>cut_number()</code>? How does that impact a visualisation of\nthe 2d distribution of <code>carat</code> and <code>price</code>?\n\nVisualise the distribution of carat, partitioned by price.\n\nHow does the price distribution of very large diamonds compare to small\ndiamonds? Is it as you expect, or does it surprise you?\n\nCombine two of the techniques you’ve learned to visualise the\ncombined distribution of cut, carat, and price.\n\nTwo dimensional plots reveal outliers that are not visible in one\ndimensional plots. \nFor example, some points in the plot below have an\nunusual combination of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values, which makes the points outliers\neven though their <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values appear normal when examined separately.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n

for this case?\n\n<h3>Patterns and models</h3>\nPatterns in your data provide clues about relationships. \nIf a systematic relationship exists between two variables it will appear as a pattern in the data. \nIf you spot a pattern, ask yourself:\n\nCould this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?\n\nHow can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?\n\nHow strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?\n\nWhat other variables might affect the relationship?\n\nDoes the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?\n\nA scatterplot of Old Faithful eruption lengths versus the wait time between eruptions shows a pattern: longer wait times are associated with longer eruptions. \nThe scatterplot also displays the two clusters that we noticed above.\n\n<code>ggplot(data = faithful) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting))</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7427e8aa85fc6150d830776fca343b9d39f239bc/35c23/eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png">\nPatterns provide one of the most useful tools for data scientists because they reveal covariation. \nIf you think of variation as a phenomenon that creates uncertainty, covariation is a phenomenon that reduces it. \nIf two variables covary, you can use the values of one variable to make better predictions about the values of the second. \nIf the covariation is due to a causal relationship (a special case), then you can use the value of one variable to control the value of the second.\n\nModels are a tool for extracting patterns out of data. \nFor example, consider the diamonds data. \nIt’s hard to understand the relationship between cut and price, because cut and carat, and carat and price are tightly related. \nIt’s possible to use a model to remove the very strong relationship between price and carat so we can explore the subtleties that remain. \nThe following code fits a model that predicts <code>price</code> from <code>carat</code> and then computes the residuals (the difference between the predicted value and the actual value). \nThe residuals give us a view of the price of the diamond, once the effect of carat has been removed.\n\n<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a>(<a

the final part of the book, <a href="model-intro.html#model-intro">model</a>. \nWe’re saving modelling for later because understanding what models are and how they work is easiest once you have tools of data wrangling and programming in hand.\n\n<h3>ggplot2 calls</h3>\nAs we move on from these introductory chapters, we’ll transition to a more concise expression of ggplot2 code. \nSo far we’ve been very explicit, which is helpful when you are learning:\n\n<code>ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) + \n  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.25)</code>\nTypically, the first one or two arguments to a function are so important that you should know them by heart. \nThe first two arguments to <code>ggplot()</code> are <code>data</code> and <code>mapping</code>, and the first two arguments to <code>aes()</code> are <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. \nIn the remainder of the book, we won’t supply those names. \nThat saves typing, and, by reducing the amount of boilerplate, makes it easier to see what’s different between plots. \nThat’s a really important programming concern that we’ll come back in <a href="functions.html#functions">functions</a>.\n\nRewriting the previous plot more concisely yields:\n\n<code>ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions)) + \n  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.25)</code>\nSometimes we’ll turn the end of a pipeline of data transformation into a plot. \nWatch for the transition from <code><a href="https://modelr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html">%>%</a></code> to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code>. \nI wish this transition wasn’t necessary but unfortunately ggplot2 was created before the pipe was discovered.\n\n<code>diamonds %>% \n  count(cut, clarity) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(clarity, cut, fill = n)) + \n    geom_tile()</code>\n\n<h3>Learning more</h3>\nIf you want to learn more about the mechanics of ggplot2, I’d highly recommend grabbing a copy of the ggplot2 book: <a href="https://amzn.com/331924275X">https://amzn.com/331924275X</a>. \nIt’s been recently updated, so it includes dplyr and tidyr code, and has much more space to explore all the facets of visualisation. \nUnfortunately the book isn’t generally available for free, but if you have a connection to a university you can probably get an electronic version for free through SpringerLink.\n\nAnother useful resource is the <a href="https://amzn.com/1449316956"><em>R Graphics Cookbook</em></a> by Winston Chang. \nMuch of the contents are available online at <a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/">http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/</a>.\n\nI also recommend <a href="https://amzn.com/1498715230"><em>Graphical Data Analysis with R</em></a>, by Antony Unwin. \nThis is a book-length treatment similar to the material covered in this chapter, but has the space to go into much greater depth.\n',
'<h2>Tibbles</h2>\nTibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). \n\nTibbles also have an enhanced print() method which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.\n\nHere we will describe the <k>tibble</k> package, which provides opinionated data frames that make working in the tidyverse a little easier. \nIn most places, I’ll use the term tibble and data frame interchangeably; when I want to draw particular attention to R’s built-in data frame, I’ll call them <code>data.frame</code>s.\n\nIf this chapter leaves you wanting to learn more about tibbles, you might enjoy <code>vignette("tibble")</code>.\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\nIn this chapter we’ll explore the <k>tibble</k> package, part of the core tidyverse.\n\n<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a>(<a href="http://tidyverse.tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>)</code>\n\n<h3>Creating tibbles</h3>\nAlmost all of the functions that you’ll use in this book produce tibbles, as tibbles are one of the unifying features of the tidyverse. \nMost other R packages use regular data frames, so you might want to coerce a data frame to a tibble. \nYou can do that with <code>as_tibble()</code>:\n\n<code>as_tibble(iris)\n#> #

A tibble: 1 x 3\n#>   \n:)\n  \n \n   \n2000\n\n#>   &lt;chr> &lt;chr> &lt;chr> \n#> 1 smile space number</code>\n\nYou’ll also need the backticks when working with these variables in other packages, like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.\n\nAnother way to create a tibble is with <code>tribble()</code>, short for <k>tr</k>ansposed tibble. \n<code>tribble()</code> is customised for data entry in code: column headings are defined by formulas (i.e. they start with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/tilde.html">~</a></code>), and entries are separated by commas. \nThis makes it possible to lay out small amounts of data in easy to read form.\n\n<code>tribble(\n  ~x, ~y, ~z,\n  #--|--|----\n  "a", 2, 3.6,\n  "b", 1, 8.5\n)\n#> # A tibble: 2 x 3\n#>   x         y     z\n#>   &lt;chr> &lt;dbl> &lt;dbl>\n#> 1 a         2   3.6\n#> 2 b         1   8.5</code>\n\nI often add a comment (the line starting with <code>#</code>), to make it really clear where the header is.\n\n<h3>Tibbles vs. \ndata.frame</h3>\nThere are two main differences in the usage of a tibble vs. \na classic <code>data.frame</code>: printing and subsetting.\n\n<h3>Printing</h3>\nTibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. \nThis makes it much easier to work with large data. \nIn addition to its name, each column reports its type, a nice feature borrowed from <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/str.html">str()</a></code>:\n\n<code>tibble(\n  a = lubridate::<a href="http://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/now.html">now</a>() + <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html">runif</a>(1e3) * 86400,\n  b = lubridate::<a href="http://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/now.html">today</a>() + <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html">runif</a>(1e3) * 30,\n  c = 1:1e3,\n  d = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html">runif</a>(1e3),\n  e = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample</a>(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)\n)\n#> #

(Hint: try printing <code>mtcars</code>,\nwhich is a regular data frame).\n\nCompare and contrast the following operations on a <code>data.frame</code> and equivalent tibble. \nWhat is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?\n\n<code>df = <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html">data.frame</a>(abc = 1, xyz = "a")\ndf$x\ndf[, "xyz"]\ndf[, <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a>("abc", "xyz")]</code>\n\nIf you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. <code>var = "mpg"</code>,\nhow can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?\n\nPractice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:\n\nExtracting the variable called <code>1</code>.\n\nPlotting a scatterplot of <code>1</code> vs <code>2</code>.\n\nCreating a new column called <code>3</code> which is <code>2</code> divided by <code>1</code>.\n\nRenaming the columns to <code>one</code>, <code>two</code> and <code>three</code>.\n\n<code>annoying = tibble(\n  \n1\n = 1:10,\n  \n2\n = \n1\n * 2 + <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">rnorm</a>(<a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html">length</a>(\n1\n))\n)</code>\n\nWhat does <code><a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/enframe.html">tibble::enframe()</a></code> do? When might you use it?\n\nWhat option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?\n',

'<h2>Text Analysis Packages</h2>\nA Complete Overview of the Most Useful Packages in R Data Scientists Should Know About for Text Analysis\n<h3>1. The All-Encompassing: Quanteda</h3>install.packages("quanteda")\nlibrary(quanteda)\nThis ranges from the basics in natural language processing — lexical diversity, text-preprocessing, constructing a corpus, token objects, document-feature matrix) — to more advanced statistical analysis such as wordscores or wordfish, document classification (e.g. Naive Bayes) and topic modelling.\nA useful tutorial of the package is the one developed by Kohei Watanabe and Stefan Müller (<a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io">link</a>).\n\n<h3>2. The Transformer: Text2vec</h3>install.packages("text2vec")\nlibrary(text2vec)\nThis package allows you to construct a document-term matrix (dtm) or term co-occurence matrix (tcm) from documents. \nAs such, you vectorize text by creating a map from words or n-grams to a vector space. \nBased on this, you can then fit a model to that dtm or tcm. \nThis ranges from topic modelling (LDA, LSA), word embeddings (GloVe), collocations, similarity searches and more.\nYou can find a useful tutorial of the package <a href="http://text2vec.org/index.html">here</a>.\n\n<h3>3. The Adapter: Tidytext</h3>install.packages("tidytext")\nlibrary(tidytext)\nOne of its benefits is that it works very well in tandem with other tidy tools in R such as dplyr or tidyr. \nYou can find a useful tutorial of the package <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com">here</a>.\n\n<h3>4. The Matcher: Stringr</h3>install.packages("stringr")\nlibrary(stringr)\nWhen it comes to text analysis, stringr is a particularly handy package to work with regular expressions as it provides a few useful pattern matching functions. \nOther functions include character manipulation (manipulating individual characters within the strings in character vectors) and whitespace tools (add, remove, manipulate whitespace).\nThe CRAN — R project has a useful tutorial on the package (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html">link</a>).\n\n<h3>5. The Show-Off: Spacyr</h3>install.packages("spacyr")\nlibrary(spacyr)spacy_install()spacy_initialize()\nMost of you may know the spaCy package in Python. \nWell, spacyr provides a convenient wrapper of that package in R, making it easy to access the powerful functionality of spaCy in a simple format. \nTo access these Python functionalities, spacyr opens a connection by being initialized within your R session.\nThis package is essential for more advanced natural language processing models — e.g. preparing text for deep learning — and other useful functionalities such as speech tagging, tokenization, parsing etc. \nIn addition, it also works well in combination with the quanteda and tidytext packages.\nYou can find a useful tutorial to the package <a href="https://spacyr.quanteda.io/articles/using_spacyr.html">here</a>.\n',
'<h2>Text mine using NLP techniques</h2>\nTo investigate a collection of text documents (corpus) and find the words (entities) that represent the collection of words in this corpus. \n<h3>Operation Buggy</h3>\nSay you are a tester and you are called in to help a DevOps team with their issue management system. \nBut the only thing you have been given are text documents made by the testers, which are exports of JIRA issues they reported. \nThey are large documents, and no one (including you) has time to manually read through them.\n\nAs a data scientist and QA expert, it’s your job to make sense of the data in the text documents. \nWhat parts of the system were tested, and which system components had the most found issues? This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) can enter to tackle the problem, and R, the statistical computing environment with different R packages, can be used to perform NLP methods on your data. \n(Some packages include: <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tm/versions/0.7-5">tm</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textreuse/index.html">test reuse</a>, <a href="https://opennlp.apache.org/">openNLP</a>, etc.) The choice of package depends on what you want to analyze with your data.\n\nIn this example, the immediate objective is to turn a large library of text into actionable data to:\n\n\nFind the issues with the highest risks (not the most buggy components of the system, because this component can also contain a lot of trivial issues).\nFix the component of the system with the most issues.\n\nTo tackle the problem, we need statistics. \nBy using the statistical programming language R, we can make statistical algorithms to find the most buggy component of the system under test.\n\n<h3>Retrieval of the data</h3>\nFirst, we have to retrieve and preprocess the files to enable the search for the most buggy component. \nwhat R packages do we actually need?\n\nThese are mentioned in Table 1, including their functions.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://sweetcode.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-8.15.39-AM.png">\n\nTable 1: R packages used\n\nThe functions of these R packages will be explained when the R packages are addressed.\nBefore you start to build the algorithm in R, you first have to install and load the libraries of the R packages.\n\nAfter installation, every R script first starts with addressing the R libraries as shown below.\n\nlibrary(tm)\nlibrary(SnowballC)\nlibrary(topicmodels)\n\nYou can start with retrieving the dataset (or corpus for NLP).\n\nFor this experiment, we saved three text files with bug reports from three testers in a separate directory, also being our working directory (use setwd(“directory”) to set the working directory).\n\n#set working directory (modify path as needed)\nsetwd(directory)\n\nYou can load the files from this directory in the corpus:\n\n#load files into corpus\n#get listing of .txt files in directory\nfilenames = list.files(getwd(),pattern="*.txt")  #getwd() represents working directory\n\nRead the files into a character vector, which is a basic data structure and can be read by R.\n\n#read files into a character vector\nfiles = lapply(filenames,readLines)\n\nWe now have to create a corpus from the vector.\n\n#create corpus from vector\narticles.corpus = Corpus(VectorSource(files))\n\n<h3>Preprocessing the data</h3>\nNext, we need to preprocess the text to convert it into a format that can be processed for extracting information. \nAn essential aspect involves the reduction of the size of the feature space before analyzing the text, i.e. normalization. \n(Several preprocessing methods are available, such as case-folding, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, contraction simplification etc.) What preprocessing method is necessary depends on the data we retrieve, and the kind of analysis to be performed.\n\nHere,we use case-folding and stemming.\n\nCase-folding to match all possible instances of a word (Auto and auto, for instance).\n\nStemming is the process of reducing the modified or derived words to their root form.\nThis way, we also match the resulting root forms.\n\n# make each letter lowercase\narticles.corpus = tm_map(articles.corpus, tolower)\n#stemming\narticles.corpus = tm_map(articles.corpus, stemDocument);\n\n<h3>Create the DTM</h3>\nThe next step is to create a document-term matrix (DTM). \nThis is critical, because to interpret and analyze the text files, they must ultimately be converted into a document-term matrix.\nThe DTM holds the number of term occurrences per document. \nThe rows in a DTM represent the documents, and each term in a document is represented as a column. \nWe’ll also remove the low-frequency words (or sparse terms) after converting the corpus into the DTM.\n\n<h3>articleDtm = DocumentTermMatrix(articles.corpus, control = list(minWordLength = 3));\narticleDtm2 = removeSparseTerms(articleDtm, sparse=0.98)</h3>\n<h3>Topic modeling</h3>\nWe are now ready to find the words in the corpus that represent the collection of words used in the corpus: the essentials.\n\nThis is also called topic modeling.\nThe topic modeling technique we will use here is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). \nThe purpose of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lda-explanation-gaurhari-dass">LDA</a> is to learn the representation of a fixed number of topics, and given this number of topics, learn the topic distribution that each document in a collection of documents has.\n\nExplaining LDA goes far beyond the scope of this article. \nFor now, just follow the code as written below.\n\n#LDA\nk = 5;\nSEED = 1234;\narticle.lda = LDA(articleDtm2, k, method="Gibbs", control=list(seed = SEED))\nlda.topics = as.matrix(topics(article.lda))\nlda.topics\nlda.terms = terms(article.lda)\n\nIf you now run the full code in R as explained above, you will calculate the essentials, the words in the corpus that represent the collection of words used in the corpus.\n\nFor this experiment, the results were:\n\n> lda.terms\n    Topic 1     Topic 2     Topic 3     Topic 4     Topic 5 \n     "theo" "customers"    "angela"       "crm"      "paul"\n\nTopics 1 and 3 can be explained: theo and angela are testers.\n\nTopic 5 is also easily explained: paul is a fixer.\n\nTopic 4, crm, is the system under test, so it’s not surprising it shows up as a term in the LDA, because it is mentioned in every issue by every tester.\n\nNow, we still have topic 2: customers.\n\nCustomers is a component of the system under test: crm.\n\nCustomers is most mentioned as a component in the issues found by all the testers involved.\n\nFinally, we have found our most buggy component.\n\n<h3>Wrap-up</h3>\nThis article described a method we can use to investigate a collection of text documents (corpus) and find the words that represent the collection of words in this corpus. \nFor this article’s example, R (together with NLP techniques) was used to find the component of the system under test with the most issues found.\n\n<h3>R code</h3>\nlibrary(tm)\nlibrary(SnowballC)\nlibrary(topicmodels)\n\n# TEXT RETRIEVAL\n\n#set working directory (modify path as needed)\nld\n\n#load files into corpus\n#get

Sentiment Analysis" Series. \nThe first article introduced Azure Cognitive Services and demonstrated the setup and use of Text Analytics APIs for extracting key Phrases & Sentiment Scores from text data. \nThe second article demonstrated Power BI visualizations for analyzing Key Phrases & Sentiment Scores and interpreting them to gain insights. \nThis article explores R for text mining and sentiment analysis. \nI will demonstrate several common text analytics techniques and visualizations in R.\nNote: This article assumes basic familiarity with R and RStudio. \nPlease jump to the References section for more information on installing R and RStudio. \nThe Demo data raw text file and R script are available for download from my GitHub repository; please find the link in the References section.\nR is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. \nIt provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is highly extensible. \nR is available as free software. \nIt\'s easy to learn\nand use and can produce well designed publication-quality plots. \nFor the demos in this article, I am using R version 3.5.3 (2019-03-11), RStudio Version 1.1.456\nThe input file for this article has only one column, the "Raw text" of survey responses and is a text file.\nA sample of the first few rows are shown in Notepad++ (showing all characters) in Figure 1.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica.png">\nThe demo R script and demo input text file are available on my GitHub repo (please find the link in the References section).\nR has a rich set of packages for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generating plots. \nThe foundational steps involve loading the text file into an R Corpus, then cleaning and stemming the data before performing analysis. \nI will demonstrate these steps and analysis like Word Frequency, Word Cloud, Word Association, Sentiment Scores and Emotion Classification using various plots and charts.\n<h3>Installing and loading R packages</h3>\nThe following packages are used in the examples in this article:\n<k>tm</k> for text mining operations like removing numbers, special characters, punctuations and stop words (Stop words in any language are the most commonly occurring words that have very little value for NLP and should be filtered out. \nExamples of stop words in English are "the", "is", "are".)\n<k>snowballc</k> for stemming, which is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. \nFor example, a stemming algorithm would reduce the words "fishing", "fished" and "fisher" to the stem "fish".\n<k>wordcloud</k> for generating the word cloud plot.\n<k>RColorBrewer</k> for color palettes used in various plots\n<k>syuzhet</k> for sentiment scores and emotion classification\n<k>ggplot2</k> for plotting graphs\nOpen RStudio and create a new R Script. \nUse the following code to install and load these packages.\n# Install\ninstall.packages("tm")  # for text mining\ninstall.packages("SnowballC") # for text stemming\ninstall.packages("wordcloud") # word-cloud generator \ninstall.packages("RColorBrewer") # color palettes\ninstall.packages("syuzhet") # for sentiment analysis\ninstall.packages("ggplot2") # for plotting graphs\n# Load\nlibrary("tm")\nlibrary("SnowballC")\nlibrary("wordcloud")\nlibrary("RColorBrewer")\nlibrary("syuzhet")\nlibrary("ggplot2")\n<h3>Reading file data into R</h3>\nThe R base function <code>read.table()</code> is generally used to read a file in table format and imports data as a data frame. \nSeveral variants of this function are available, for importing different file formats;\n<k>read.csv() is</k> used for reading comma-separated value (csv) files, where a comma "," is used a field separator\n<k>read.delim()</k> is used for reading tab-separated values (.txt) files\nThe input file has multiple lines of text and no columns/fields (data is not tabular), so you will use the <code>readLines</code> function. \nThis function takes a file (or URL) as input and returns a vector containing as many elements as the number of lines in the file. \nThe <code>readLines</code> function simply extracts the text from its input source and returns each line as a character string. \nThe <code>n=</code> argument is useful to read a limited number (subset) of lines from the input source (Its default value is -1, which reads all lines from the input source). \nWhen using the filename in this function\'s argument, R assumes the file is in your current working directory (you can use the <code>getwd()</code> function in R console to find your current working directory). \nYou can also choose the input file interactively, using the <code>file.choose()</code> function within the argument. \nThe next step is to load that Vector as a Corpus. \nIn R, a Corpus is a collection of text document(s) to apply text mining or NLP routines on. \nDetails of using the <code>readLines</code> function are sourced from: <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spector/s133/Read.html">https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spector/s133/Read.html</a> .\nIn your R script, add the following code to load the data into a corpus.\n# Read the text file from local machine , choose file interactively\nchoose.files(default = "", caption = "Select files",\n multi = TRUE, filters = Filters, index = nrow(Filters))\n\ntext = readLines(file.choose())\n# Load the data as a corpus\nTextDoc = Corpus(VectorSource(text))\nUpon running this, you will be prompted to select the input file. \nNavigate to your file and click <em>Open </em>as shown in Figure 2.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-1.png">\n<h3>Cleaning up Text Data</h3>\nCleaning the text data starts with making transformations like removing special characters from the text. \nThis is done using the <code>tm_map()</code> function to replace special characters like <code>/</code>, <code>@</code> and <code>|</code> with a space. \nThe next step is to remove the unnecessary whitespace and convert the text to lower case.\nThen remove the <em>stopwords</em>. \nThey are the most commonly occurring words in a language and have very little value in terms of gaining useful information. \nThey should be removed before performing further analysis. \nExamples of stopwords in English are "the, is, at, on<em>"</em>. \nThere is no single universal list of stop words used by all NLP tools. \n<code>stopwords</code> in the <code>tm_map()</code> function supports several languages like English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. \nPlease note the language names are case sensitive. \nI will also demonstrate how to add your own list of stopwords, which is useful in this Team Health example for removing non-default stop words like "team", "company", "health". \nNext, remove numbers and punctuation.\nThe last step is text stemming. \nIt is the process of reducing the word to its root form. \nThe stemming process simplifies the word to its common origin. \nFor example, the stemming process reduces the words "fishing", "fished" and "fisher" to its stem "fish". \nPlease note stemming uses the <em>SnowballC</em> package. \n(You may want to skip the text stemming step if your users indicate a preference to see the original "unstemmed" words in the word cloud plot)\nIn your R script, add the following code to transform and run to clean-up the text data.\n#Replacing "/", "@" and "|" with space\ntoSpace = content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, toSpace, "/")\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, toSpace, "@")\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, toSpace, "//|")\n# Convert the text to lower case\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, content_transformer(tolower))\n# Remove numbers\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, removeNumbers)\n# Remove english common stopwords\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, removeWords, stopwords("english"))\n# Remove your own stop word\n# specify your custom stopwords as a character vector\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, removeWords, c("s", "company", "team")) \n# Remove punctuations\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, removePunctuation)\n# Eliminate extra white spaces\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, stripWhitespace)\n# Text stemming - which reduces words to their root form\nTextDoc = tm_map(TextDoc, stemDocument)\n \n<h3>Building the term document matrix</h3>\nAfter cleaning the text data, the next step is to count the occurrence of each word, to identify popular or trending topics. \nUsing the function <code>TermDocumentMatrix()</code> from the text mining package, you can build a Document Matrix &ndash; a table containing the frequency of words.\nIn your R script, add the following code and run it to see the top 5 most frequently found words in your text.\n# Build a term-document matrix\nTextDoc_dtm = TermDocumentMatrix(TextDoc)\ndtm_m = as.matrix(TextDoc_dtm)\n# Sort by descearing value of frequency\ndtm_v = sort(rowSums(dtm_m),decreasing=TRUE)\ndtm_d = data.frame(word = names(dtm_v),freq=dtm_v)\n# Display the top 5 most frequent words\nhead(dtm_d, 5)\nThe following table of word frequency is the expected output of the <code>head</code> command on RStudio Console.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/word-image-1.png">\nPlotting the top 5 most frequent words using a bar chart is a good basic way to visualize this word frequent data. \nIn your R script, add the following code and run it to generate a bar chart, which will display in the <em>Plots</em> sections of RStudio.\n# Plot the most frequent words\nbarplot(dtm_d[1:5,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = dtm_d[1:5,]$word,\n        col ="lightgreen", main ="Top 5 most frequent words",\n        ylab = "Word frequencies")\nThe plot can be seen in Figure 3.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati.png">\nOne could interpret the following from this bar chart:\nThe most frequently occurring word is "good". \nAlso notice that negative words like "not" don\'t feature in the bar chart, which indicates there are no negative prefixes to change the context or meaning of the word "good" ( In short, this indicates most responses don\'t mention negative phrases like "not good").\n"work", "health" and "feel" are the next three most frequently occurring words, which indicate that most people feel good about their work and their team\'s health.\nFinally, the root "improv" for words like "improve", "improvement", "improving", etc. \nis also on the chart, and you need further analysis to infer if its context is positive or negative\n<h3>Generate the Word Cloud</h3>\nA word cloud is one of the most popular ways to visualize and analyze qualitative data. \nIt\'s an image composed of keywords found within a body of text, where the size of each word indicates its frequency in that body of text. \nUse the word frequency data frame (table) created previously to generate the word cloud. \nIn your R script, add the following code and run it to generate the word cloud and display it in the <em>Plots</em> section of RStudio.\n#generate word cloud\nset.seed(1234)\nwordcloud(words = dtm_d$word, freq = dtm_d$freq, min.freq = 5,\n          max.words=100, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.40, \n          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))\nBelow is a brief description of the arguments used in the word cloud function;\n<k>words</k> &#8211; words to be plotted\n<k>freq</k> &#8211; frequencies of words\n<k>min.freq</k> &ndash; words whose frequency is at or above this threshold value is plotted (in this case, I have set it to 5)\n<k>max.words</k> &ndash; the maximum number of words to display on the plot (in the code above, I have set it 100)\n<k>random.order</k> &ndash; I have set it to FALSE, so the words are plotted in order of decreasing frequency\n<k>rot.per</k> &ndash; the percentage of words that are displayed as vertical text (with 90-degree rotation). \nI have set it 0.40 (40 %), please feel free to adjust this setting to suit your preferences\n<k>colors</k> &ndash; changes word colors going from lowest to highest frequencies\nYou can see the resulting word cloud in Figure 4.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-1.png">\nThe word cloud shows additional words that occur frequently and could be of interest for further analysis. \nWords like "need", "support", "issu" (root for "issue(s)", etc. \ncould provide more context around the most frequently occurring words and help to gain a better understanding of the main themes.\n<h3>Word Association</h3>\nCorrelation is a statistical technique that can demonstrate whether, and how strongly, pairs of variables are related. \nThis technique can be used effectively to analyze which words occur most often in association with the most frequently occurring words in the survey responses, which helps to see the context around these words\nIn your R script, add the following code and run it.\n# Find associations \nfindAssocs(TextDoc_dtm, terms = c("good","work","health"), corlimit = 0.25)\nYou should see the results as shown in Figure 5.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-2.png">\nThis script shows which words are most frequently associated with the top three terms (<code>corlimit = 0.25</code> is the lower limit/threshold I have set. \nYou can set it lower to see more words, or higher to see less). \nThe output indicates that "integr" (which is the root for word "integrity") and "synergi" (which is the root for words "synergy", "synergies", etc.) and occur 28% of the time with the word "good". \nYou can interpret this as the context around the most frequently occurring word ("good") is positive. \nSimilarly, the root of the word "together" is highly correlated with the word "work". \nThis indicates that most responses are saying that teams "work together" and can be interpreted in a positive context.\nYou can modify the above script to find terms associated with words that occur at least 50 times or more, instead of having to hard code the terms in your script.\n# Find associations for words that occur at least 50 times\nfindAssocs(TextDoc_dtm, terms = findFreqTerms(TextDoc_dtm, lowfreq = 50), corlimit = 0.25)\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-3.png">\n<h3>Sentiment Scores</h3>\nSentiments can be classified as positive, neutral or negative. \nThey can also be represented on a numeric scale, to better express the degree of positive or negative strength of the sentiment contained in a body of text.\nThis example uses the Syuzhet package for generating sentiment scores, which has four sentiment dictionaries and offers a method for accessing the sentiment extraction tool developed in the NLP group at Stanford. \nThe <code>get_sentiment</code> function accepts two arguments: a character vector (of sentences or words) and a method. \nThe selected method determines which of the four available sentiment extraction methods will be used. \nThe four methods are <code>syuzhet</code> (this is the default), <code>bing</code>, <code>afinn</code> and <code>nrc</code>. \nEach method uses a different scale and hence returns slightly different results. \nPlease note the outcome of <code>nrc</code> method is more than just a numeric score, requires

the R script and run it.\n# regular sentiment score using get_sentiment() function and method of your choice\n# please note that different methods may have different scales\nsyuzhet_vector =

inspection of the Syuzhet vector shows the first element has the value of <em>2.60</em>. \nIt means the sum of the sentiment scores of all meaningful words in the first response(line) in the text file, adds up to 2.60. \nThe scale for sentiment scores using the <code>syuzhet</code> method is decimal and ranges from -1(indicating most negative) to +1(indicating most positive). \nNote that the summary statistics of the <code>suyzhet</code> vector show a median value of 1.6, which is above zero and can be interpreted as the overall average sentiment across all the responses is positive.\nNext, run the same analysis for the remaining two methods and inspect their respective vectors. \nAdd the following code to the R script and run it.\n# bing\nbing_vector =

interpreted as the overall average sentiment across the all the responses is positive.\nBecause these different methods use different scales, it\'s better to convert their output to a common scale before comparing them. \nThis basic scale conversion can be done easily using R\'s built-in <code>sign</code> function, which converts all positive number to 1, all negative numbers to -1 and all zeros remain 0.\nAdd the following code to your R script and run it.\n#compare the first row of each vector using sign function\nrbind(\n  sign(head(syuzhet_vector)),\n  sign(head(bing_vector)),\n

the first element of each row (vector) is <em>1</em>, indicating that all three methods have calculated a positive sentiment score, for the first response (line) in the text.\n<h3>Emotion Classification</h3>\nEmotion classification is built on the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (aka EmoLex). \nThe definition of "NRC Emotion Lexicon", sourced from <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm</a> is "The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). \nThe annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing."\nTo understand this, explore the <code>get_nrc_sentiments</code> function, which returns a data frame with each row representing a sentence from the original file. \nThe data frame has ten columns (one column for each of the eight emotions, one column for positive sentiment valence and one for negative sentiment valence). \nThe data in the columns (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust, negative, positive) can be accessed individually or in sets. \nThe definition of <code>get_nrc_sentiments</code> has been sourced from: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html?">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html?</a>\nAdd the following line to your R script and run it, to see the data frame generated from the previous execution of the <code>get_nrc_sentiment</code> function.\n# run nrc sentiment analysis to return data frame with each row classified as one of the following\n# emotions, rather than a score: \n# anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust \n# It also counts the number of positive and negative emotions found in each row\nd=get_nrc_sentiment(text)\n# head(d,10) - to see top 10 lines of the get_nrc_sentiment dataframe\nhead (d,10)\nThe results should look like Figure 10.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-7.png">\n<k>Figure 10. \nData frame returned by get_nrc_sentiment function</k>\nThe output shows that the first line of text has;\nZero occurrences of words associated with emotions of anger, disgust, fear, sadness and surprise\nOne occurrence each of words associated with emotions of anticipation and joy\nTwo occurrences of words associated with emotions of trust\nTotal of one occurrence of words associated with negative emotions\nTotal of two occurrences of words associated with positive emotions\nThe next step is to create two plots charts to help visually analyze the emotions in this survey text. \nFirst, perform some data transformation and clean-up steps before plotting charts. \nThe first plot shows the total number of instances of words in the text, associated with each of the eight emotions. \nAdd the following code to your R script and run it.\n#transpose\ntd=data.frame(t(d))\n#The function rowSums computes column sums across rows for each level of a grouping variable.\ntd_new = data.frame(rowSums(td[2:253]))\n#Transformation and cleaning\nnames(td_new)[1] = "count"\ntd_new = cbind("sentiment" = rownames(td_new), td_new)\nrownames(td_new) = NULL\ntd_new2=td_new[1:8,]\n#Plot One - count of words associated with each sentiment\nquickplot(sentiment, data=td_new2, weight=count, geom="bar", fill=sentiment, ylab="count")+ggtitle("Survey sentiments")\nYou can see the bar plot in Figure 11.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-8.png">\n<k>Figure 11. \nBar Plot showing the count of words in the text, associated with each emotion</k>\nThis bar chart demonstrates that words associated with the positive emotion of "trust" occurred about five hundred times in the text, whereas words associated with the negative emotion of "disgust" occurred less than 25 times. \nA deeper understanding of the overall emotions occurring in the survey response can be gained by comparing these number as a percentage of the total number of meaningful words. \nAdd the following code to your R script and run it.\n#Plot two - count of words associated with each sentiment, expressed as a percentage\nbarplot(\n  sort(colSums(prop.table(d[, 1:8]))), \n  horiz = TRUE, \n  cex.names = 0.7, \n  las = 1, \n  main = "Emotions in Text", xlab="Percentage"\n)\nThe Emotions bar plot can be seen in figure 12.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-9.png">\n<k>Figure 12. \nBar Plot showing the count of words associated with each sentiment expressed as a percentage </k>\nThis bar plot allows for a quick and easy comparison of the proportion of words associated with each emotion in the text. \nThe emotion "trust" has the longest bar and shows that words associated with this positive emotion constitute just over 35% of all the meaningful words in this text. \nOn the other hand, the emotion of "disgust" has the shortest bar and shows that words associated with this negative emotion constitute less than 2% of all the meaningful words in this text. \nOverall, words associated with the positive emotions of "trust" and "joy" account for almost 60% of the meaningful words in the text, which can be interpreted as a good sign of team health.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nThis article demonstrated reading text data into R, data cleaning and transformations. \nIt demonstrated how to create a word frequency table and plot a word cloud, to identify prominent themes occurring in the text. \nWord association analysis using correlation, helped gain context around the prominent themes. \nIt explored four methods to generate sentiment scores, which proved useful in assigning a numeric value to strength (of positivity or negativity) of sentiments in the text and allowed interpreting that the average sentiment through the text is trending positive. \nLastly, it demonstrated how to implement an emotion classification with NRC sentiment and created two plots to analyze and interpret emotions found in the text.\n',

href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ponyexpress" target="_blank">ponyexpress</a>	A package to automate email sending from R via Gmail (based on the gmailR package)\nWe won’t focus on all of them, but we will introduce the most common and convenient options.\n<h3>Sending emails in R via SMTP</h3>\nWhichever R package of the following you choose, keep in mind that you need to have an SMTP server to send emails. \nIn our examples, we’ll be using Mailtrap, a service providing a fake SMTP server for testing. \n<h3>sendmailR </h3>\nsendmailR can be used for sending all sorts of email notifications such as completed jobs and scheduled tasks. \nAt the same time, you can distribute analytical results to stakeholders using this R package as well. \nsendmailR is mostly used for SMTP servers without authentication. \nThat’s why we won’t use Mailtrap in the following examples. \n\nLet’s install the package first:\ninstall.packages("sendmailR",repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\nNext, we create a data structure called Server, which is a map with a single key value pair – key: smtpServer, value: smtp.example.io: \nServer=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io")\n\nNow, let’s write a few R lines to send a simple email:\nlibrary(sendmailR)\nfrom = sprintf("&lt;user@sender.com>","The Sender") # the sender’s name is an optional value\nto = sprintf("&lt;user@recipient.com>")\nsubject = "Test email subject"\nbody = "Test email body"\nsendmail(from,to,subject,body,control=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io"))\n\nThe following code sample is for sending an email to multiple recipients:\nfrom = sprintf("&lt;user@sender.com>","The Sender")\nto =sprintf(c("&lt;user@recipient.com>","&lt;user2@recipient.com>", "&lt;user3@recipient.com>")\nsubject = "Test email subject"\nbody = "Test email body"\nsapply(to,function(x) sendmail(from,to=x,subject,body,control=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io"))\n\nAnd now, let’s send an email with an attachment as well:\nfrom = sprintf("&lt;user@sender.com>","The Sender")\nto = sprintf("&lt;user@recipient.com>")\nsubject = "Test email subject"\nbody = "Test email body"\nattachmentPath ="C:/.../Attachment.png"\nattachmentObject =mime_part(x=attachmentPath,name=attachmentName)\nbodyWithAttachment = list(body,attachmentObject)\nsendmail(from,to,subject,bodyWithAttachment,control=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io"))\n\nNB: To send emails with sendmailR, you may also need to configure your machine so it can send emails from your local host. \nWe’ve covered this step in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="/blog/setup-smtp-server/" target="_blank">How To Set Up An SMTP Server</a>.\n<h3>mailR</h3>\nIf you employ an authentication-based SMTP server, you’d better pick the mailR package. \nIt’s a wrapper around Apache Commons Email, an email library built on top of the Java Mail API. \nDue to this, mailR has a dependency on the rJava package, a low-level interface to Java VM. \nThis requires Java Runtime Environment to be installed. \nYou can download it from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a>. \nIn case of problems with pointing to the right Java binary, refer to <a href="https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/151" target="_blank">this troubleshooting guide</a> on GitHub. \nIn practice, this may cause a bit of trouble when deploying in some environments. \nNevertheless, mailR is a rather popular solution to automate sending emails with the R that offers the following:\nmultiple recipients (Cc, Bcc, and ReplyTo)multiple attachments (both from the file system and URLs)HTML formatted emails \nInstall the package:\ninstall.packages("mailR",repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\nNow, we can use the Mailtrap SMTP server that requires authentication to send an email:\nlibrary(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = "user@recipient.com",\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "Test emails body",\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n    send = TRUE)\n\nInsert your Mailtrap credentials (user.name and passwd) and pick any SMTP port of 25, 465, 587, 2525.\nHere is how to send an email to multiple recipients:\nlibrary(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = c("Recipient 1 &lt;user1@recipient.com>", "Recipient 2 &lt;user@recipient.com>"),\n    cc = c("CC Recipient &lt;cc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    bcc = c("BCC Recipient &lt;bcc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    replyTo = c("Reply to Recipient &lt;reply-to@recipient.com>"),\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "Test emails body",\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n    send = TRUE)\n\nNow, let’s add a few attachments to the email:\nlibrary(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = c("Recipient 1 &lt;user1@recipient.com>", "Recipient 2 &lt;user@recipient.com>"),\n    cc = c("CC Recipient &lt;cc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    bcc = c("BCC Recipient &lt;bcc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    replyTo = c("Reply to Recipient &lt;reply-to@recipient.com>"),\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "Test emails body",\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n    send = TRUE,\n    attach.files = c("./attachment.png", "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/123456/Attachment.pdf"),\n    file.names = c("Attachment.png", "Attachment.pdf"), #this is an optional parameter\n    file.descriptions = c("Description for Attachment.png", "Description for Attachment.pdf")) #this is an optional parameter\nEventually, let’s send an HTML email from R:\nlibrary(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = "user@recipient.com",\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>",\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n    send = TRUE)\nYou can also point to an HTML template by specifying its location, as follows:\nbody = "./Template.html",\n<h3>blastula</h3>\nThe blastula package allows you to craft and send responsive HTML emails in R programming. \nWe’ll review how to send emails via the SMTP server, however, blastula also supports the Mailgun API. \nInstall the package:\ninstall.packages("blastula",repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\nand load it:\nlibrary(blastula)\nCompose an email using Markdown formatting. \nYou can also employ the following string objects:\nadd_readable_time – creates a nicely formatted date/time string for the current time \nadd_image – transforms an image to an HTML string object\nFor example,\ndate_time = add_readable_time() # => "Thursday, November 28, 2019 at 4:34 PM (CET)"\nimg_file_path = "./attachment.png" # => "&lt;img cid=/"mtwhxvdnojpr__attachment.png/" src=/"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...g==/" width=/"520/" alt=/"/"/>/n"\nimg_string = add_image(file = img_file_path)\n\nWhen composing an email, you will need the c() function to combine the strings in the email body and footer. \nYou can use three main arguments: body, header, and footer. \nIf you have Markdown and HTML fragments in the email body, use the md() function. \nHere is what we’ve got:\nlibrary(blastula)\nemail =\ncompose_email(\n  body = md(\n    c("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>",\nimg_string\n      )\n    ),\n footer = md(\n    c(\n      "Test email footer", date_time, "."\n      )\n  )\n)\nPreview the email using attach_connect_email(email = email)\nNow, let’s send the email. \nThis can be done with the smtp_send() function through one of the following ways:\nProviding the SMTP credentials directly via the creds() helper: smtp_send(\n  email = email,\n  from = "user@sender.com",\n  to = "user@recipient.com",\n  credentials = creds(\n    host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n    port = 25,\n    user = "********"\n  )\n)\nUsing a credentials key that you can generate with the create_smtp_creds_key() function: create_smtp_creds_key(\n  id = "mailtrap",\n  host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n  port = 25,\n  user = "********"\n)\nsmtp_send(\n  email = email,\n  from = "user@sender.com",\n  to = "user@recipient.com",\n  credentials = creds_key("mailtrap")\n)\nUsing a credentials file that you can generate with the create_smtp_creds_file() function:create_smtp_creds_file(\n  file = "mailtrap_file",\n  host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n  port = 25,\n  user = "********"\n)\nsmtp_send(\n  email = email,\n  from = "user@sender.com",\n  to = "user@recipient.com",\n  credentials = creds_file("mailtrap_file")\n)\nNB: There is no way to programmatically specify a password for authentication. \nThe user will be prompted to provide one during code execution.\n<h3>emayili </h3>\nemayili is the last package on our list for sending emails in R via SMTP. \nThe package works with all SMTP servers and has minimal dependencies. \nInstall it from GitHub and let’s move on:\ninstall.packages("remotes")\nlibrary(remotes)\nremotes::install_github("datawookie/emayili")\nEmayili has two classes at the core:\nenvelope – to create emails server – to communicate with the SMTP server\nLet’s create an email first:\nlibrary(emayili)\nemail = envelope() %>%\n  from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  body("Test email body")\nNow, configure the SMTP server:\nsmtp = server(host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n         port = 25,\n         username = "********",\n         password = "*********")\n\nTo send the email to multiple recipients, enhance your emails with Cc, Bcc, and Reply-To header fields as follows:\nemail = envelope() %>%\n  from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  to(c("Recipient 1 &lt;user1@recipient.com>", "Recipient 2 &lt;user@recipient.com>")) %>%\n  cc("cc@recipient.com") %>%\n  bcc("bcc@recipient.com") %>%\n  reply("reply-to@recipient.com") %>%\n  subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  body("Test email body")\n\nYou can also use the attachment() method to add attachments to your email:\nemail = email %>% attachment(c("./attachment.png", "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/123456/Attachment.pdf"))\nEventually, you can send your email with:\nsmtp(email, verbose = TRUE)\n<h3>Sending emails via Gmail API – gmailR</h3>\nToday, Gmail is one of the most popular email services. \nIt provides RESTful API for a bunch of functionalities, such as:\nsend/receive HTML emails with attachmentsCRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations with messages, drafts, threads, and labels access control of your Gmail inboxand so on\nFor sending emails from R via Gmail API, you need two things: the gmailR package and the API access. \nLet’s start with the latest, which requires four steps to be done:\nCreate a project in the Google API Console\nEnable Gmail API\nSet up credentials and authentication with OAuth 2.0\nDownload a JSON file with your credentialsWe’ve described all these steps in <a href="/blog/send-emails-with-gmail-api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">How to send emails with Gmail API</a>, so feel free to reference this blog post. \nAfter you’ve accomplished the preparation stage, get back to gmailR. \nThe package is available on CRAN, so you can install, as follows:\ninstall.packages("gmailr", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\nand load in your R script:\nlibrary(gmailr)\nNow, you can use your downloaded JSON credentials file. \nEmploy the use_secret_file() function. \nFor example, if your JSON file is named GmailCredentials.json, this will look, as follows:\nuse_secret_file("GmailCredentials.json")\nAfter that, create a MIME email object:\nemail = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_text_body("Test email body")\nTo create an HTML email, use markup to shape your HTML string, for example:\nemail = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>")\nTo add an attachment, you can:\nuse the gm_attach_file() function, if the attachment has not been loaded into R. \nYou can specify the MIME type yourself using the type parameter or let it be automatically guessed by mime::guess_type\nemail = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>") %>%\n  gm_attach_file("Attachment.png")\nuse attach_part() to attach the binary data to your file:\nemail = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>") %>%\n  gm_attach_part(part = charToRaw("attach me!"), name = "please")\nIf you need to include an image into HTML, you can use the &lt;img class="lazy" data-src=”cid:xy”> tag to reference the image. \nFirst create a plot to send, and save it to AttachImage.png:\n# 1. \nuse built-in mtcars data set\nmy_data = mtcars\n# 2. \nOpen file for writing\npng("AttachImage.png", width = 350, height = 350)\n# 3. \nCreate the plot\nplot(x = my_data$wt, y = my_data$mpg,\n  pch = 16, frame = FALSE,\n  xlab = "wt", ylab = "mpg", col = "#2E9FDF")\n# 4. \nClose the file\ndev.off()\nNow, create an HTML email that references the plot as foobar:\nemail = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body(\n    \'&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>\n    &lt;br>&lt;img class="lazy" data-src="cid:foobar">\'\n  ) %>%\n  gm_attach_file("AttachImage.png", id = "foobar")\nEventually, you can send your email:\ngm_send_message(email)\nEnjoying this Post?Join Our NewsletterOnly the best content, delivered once a month. \nUnsubscribe anytime.</p><form class="hustle-layout-form"

sending emails from Microsoft Outlook as well. \nIt’s called RDCOMClient and allows you to connect to DCOM architecture, which you can consider an API for communicating with Microsoft Office in Windows environments. \nLet’s explore how to connect R to the Outlook app installed on your Windows.\nInstall RDCOMClient via an option of your choice:\nfrom CRAN:\ninstall.packages("RDCOMClient")\nvia devtools:\ndevtools::install_github("omegahat/RDCOMClient")\nfrom the Windows command line:\nR CMD INSTALL RDCOMClient\nWarning: if you receive a message like package ‘RDCOMClient’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)” during the installation from CRAN, try to install RDCOMClient from the source repository:\ninstall.packages("RDCOMClient", repos = "http://www.omegahat.net/R")\nLoad the package, open Outlook, and create a simple email:\nlibrary(RDCOMClient)\nOutlook = COMCreate("Outlook.Application")\nEmail = Outlook$CreateItem(0)\nEmail[["to"]] = "user@recipient.com"\nEmail[["subject"]] = "Test email subject"\nEmail[["body"]] = "Test email body"\nIf you need to change the default From: field and send from a secondary mailbox, use:\nEmail[["SentOnBehalfOfName"]] = "user@sender.com"\nHere is how you can specify multiple recipients, as well as Cc and Bcc headers:\nEmail[["to"]] = "user1@recipient.com, user2@recipient.com"\nEmail[["cc"]] = "cc.user@recipient.com"\nEmail[["bcc"]] = "bcc.user@recipient.com"\nTo create an HTML email, use [["htmlbody"]]. \nYou can simply add your HTML in the R code as follows:\nlibrary(RDCOMClient)\nOutlook = COMCreate("Outlook.Application")\nEmail = Outlook$CreateItem(0)\nEmail[["to"]] = "user@recipietn.com"\nEmail[["subject"]] = "Test email subject"\nEmail[["htmlbody"]] =\n"&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>"\nLet’s also add an attachment: \nlibrary(RDCOMClient)\nOutlook = COMCreate("Outlook.Application")\nEmail = Outlook$CreateItem(0)\nEmail[["to"]] = "user@recipient.com"\nEmail[["subject"]] = "Test email subject"\nEmail[["htmlbody"]] =\n"&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>"\nEmail[["attachments"]]$Add("C:/.../Attachment.png")\nNow, you can send the email:\noutMail$Send()\n<h3>How to send bulk emails from R?</h3>\nLet’s say your mail list includes many more than ten recipients and you need to send bulk emails from R. \nWe’ll show you how this can be done via Web API (gmailR) and SMTP (mailR).\n<h3>Bulk emails with gmailR</h3>\nAs an example, we’ll inform recipients of how much they won in the lottery. \nFor this, we need:\nan enabled API access on your Google account. an installed gmailr R package.a set of R packages for data iteration: readr, dplyr, and purrr (or plyr as an alternative).a file containing the variable bits (lottery wins), Variables.csv, with the following format:\nlastname,firstname,win_amount,email_address\nSMITH,JOHN,1234,johnsmith@winner.com\nLOCKWOOD,JANE,1234,janelockwood24@example.com\nNow, let’s go through the mail steps to create an R script for bulk emails.\nLoad the packages and files we need:\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gmailr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr))\nlibrary(readr) # => if you don’t have it, run: install.packages("readr", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\nmy_dat = read_csv("Variables.csv") \nCreate a data frame that will insert variables from the file into the email: \nthis_hw = "Lottery Winners"\nemail_sender = \'Best Lottery Ever &lt;info@best-lottery-ever.com>\'\noptional_bcc = \'Anonymous &lt;bcc@example.com>\'\nbody = "Hi, %s.\nYour lottery win is %s.\nThanks for betting with us!\n"\nedat = my_dat %>%\n    mutate(\n        To = sprintf(\'%s &lt;%s>\', firstname, email_address),\n        Bcc = optional_bcc,\n        From = email_sender,\n        Subject = sprintf(\'Lottery win for %s\', win_amount),\n        body = sprintf(body, firstname, win_amount)) %>%\n    select(To, Bcc, From, Subject, body)\nwrite_csv(edat, "data-frame.csv")\nThe data frame will be saved to data-frame.csv. \nThis will provide an easy-to-read record of the composed emails. \nNow, convert each row of the data frame into a MIME object using the gmailr::mime() function. \nAfter that, purrr::pmap() generates the list of MIME objects, one per row of the input data frame:\nemails = edat %>%\n  pmap(mime)\nstr(emails, max.level = 2, list.len = 2)\nIf you use plyr (install.packages("plyr")), you can do this, as follows:\nemails = plyr::dlply(edat, ~ To, function(x) mime(\n  To = x$To,\n  Bcc = x$Bcc,\n  From = x$From,\n  Subject = x$Subject,\n  body = x$body))\nSpecify your JSON credentials file:\nuse_secret_file("GmailCredentials.json")\nAnd send emails with purrr::safely(). \nThis will protect your bulk emails from failures in the middle:\nsafe_send_message = safely(send_message)\nsent_mail = emails %>%\n  map(safe_send_message)\nsaveRDS(sent_mail,\n        paste(gsub("//s+", "_", this_hw), "sent-emails.rds", sep = "_"))\nList recipients with TRUE in case of errors:\nerrors = sent_mail %>%\n  transpose() %>%\n  .$error %>%\n  map_lgl(Negate(is.null))\nTake a look at the full code now:\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gmailr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr))\nlibrary(readr) # => if you don’t have it, run: install.packages("readr", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\nmy_dat = read_csv("Variables.csv")\nthis_hw = "Lottery Winners"\nemail_sender = \'Best Lottery Ever &lt;info@best-lottery-ever.com>\'\noptional_bcc = \'Anonymous &lt;bcc@example.com>\'\nbody = "Hi, %s.\nYour lottery win is %s.\nThanks for betting with us!\n"\nedat = my_dat %>%\n    mutate(\n        To = sprintf(\'%s &lt;%s>\', firstname, email_address),\n        Bcc = optional_bcc,\n        From = email_sender,\n        Subject = sprintf(\'Lottery win for %s\', win_amount),\n        body = sprintf(body, firstname, win_amount)) %>%\n    select(To, Bcc, From, Subject, body)\nwrite_csv(edat, "data-frame.csv")\nemails = edat %>%\n  pmap(mime)\nstr(emails, max.level = 2, list.len = 2)\nuse_secret_file("GmailCredentials.json")\nsafe_send_message = safely(send_message)\nsent_mail = emails %>%\n  map(safe_send_message)\nsaveRDS(sent_mail,\n        paste(gsub("//s+", "_", this_hw), "sent-emails.rds", sep = "_"))\nerrors = sent_mail %>%\n  transpose() %>%\n  .$error %>%\n  map_lgl(Negate(is.null))\n<h3>Bulk emails with mailR</h3>\nIf you want to send bulk emails with SMTP, make sure to have an appropriate SMTP server and install the mailR package. \nOnce again, we’ll need a .csv file that will contain the data frame you want to integrate into the email. \nThe data should be separated by a special character such as a comma, a semicolon, or a tab9. \nFor example:\nlastname; firstname; win_amount; email_address\nSMITH; JOHN; 1234; johnsmith@winner.com\nLOCKWOOD; JANE; 1234; janelockwood24@example.com\nWhat you need to do next:\nBuild the HTML email body for a given recipient using the message_text function:\nmessage_text = function(x) sprintf(\'Hello %s %s!/nCongratulation to your win./nYour prize is XXX./nBet with the Best Lottery Ever!\', x$firstname, x$lastname)\nLoad the package and read in the mail list:\nlibrary(mailR)\nmail_list = read.csv2("Variables.csv",as.is=TRUE)\nValues in the Variables.csv should be separated with a semicolon (;). \nYou can configure settings to read the data frame using the read.table or read.csv functions.\nCreate a file to write the information of each individual row in the mail_list after each email is sent.\nmy_file = file("mail.out",open="w")\n# … write data here\nclose(my_file)\nPerform the batch emailing to all students in the mail list:\nfor (recipient in 1:nrow(mail_list)) {\n  body = message_text(mail_list[recipient,])\n  send.mail(from="info@best-lottery-ever.com",\n    to=as.character(mail_list[recipient,]$email_address),\n    subject="Lottery Winners",\n    body=body,\n    html=TRUE,\n    authenticate=TRUE,\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n    user.name = "*****", passwd = "*****", ssl = TRUE),\n    encoding = "utf-8",send=TRUE)\n  print(mail_list[recipient,])\n  Sys.sleep(runif(n=1,min=3,max=6))\n  #write each recipient to a file\n  result_file = file("mail.out",open="a")\n  writeLines(text=paste0("[",recipient,"] ",\n    paste0(as.character(mail_list[recipient,]),collapse="/t")),\n    sep="/n",con=result_file)\n  close(result_file)\n}\nAnd here is the full code:\nmessage_text = function(x) sprintf(\'Hello %s %s!/nCongratulation to your win./nYour prize is XXX./nBet with the Best Lottery Ever!\', x$firstname, x$lastname)\nlibrary(mailR)\nmail_list = read.csv2("Variables.csv",as.is=TRUE)\nmy_file = file("mail.out",open="w")\n# … write data here\nclose(my_file)\nfor (recipient in 1:nrow(mail_list)) {\n  body = message_text(mail_list[recipient,])\n  send.mail(from="info@best-lottery-ever.com",\n    to=as.character(mail_list[recipient,]$email_address),\n    subject="Lottery Winners",\n    body=body,\n

paste0(as.character(mail_list[recipient,]),collapse="/t")),\n    sep="/n",con=result_file)\n  close(result_file)\n}\n<h3>How to test email sending in R with Mailtrap</h3>\nIf you choose to send emails from R via SMTP, then Mailtrap is what you need for testing. \nIt’s a universal service with a fake SMTP server underneath. \nThis means, your test emails are not actually being sent. \nThey go from your app or any other mail client to the SMTP server and are trapped there. \nThus, you protect your real recipients from an undesirable experience – they won’t receive any of your test emails. \nAll the aforementioned examples with Mailtrap credentials work in this way. \nIf you need to test anything else, just replace your SMTP credentials with those of Mailtrap and that’s it. \nFor this, you need to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/register/signup?ref=header" target="_blank">sign up</a> first using your email, GitHub or Google account. \nA FREE FOREVER plan is available! For more on the features and functions provided by Mailtrap, read the <a href="https://help.mailtrap.io/article/12-getting-started-guide">Getting Started Guide</a>.\n<h3>To wrap up</h3>\nWe’ve listed a number of options for sending emails in R, so choose the one that best fits your requirements. \nFor example, if you need to send hundreds (or even thousands) of emails daily, gmailR may be the best solution. \nOn the other hand, sending via SMTP is a more common and reliable way and R provides a few packages for this. \nSo, good luck with your choice!\n',

'<h2>R and Javascript Execution, Libraries, Integration</h2>\nFor what reason somebody might want to incorporate R into web applications?\n\nThere are quite a few reasons for this. \nWhen you add R to your solution, a vast opportunity of analytics opens up like statistics, predictive data modelling, forecasting, machine learning, visualization and much more.\n\nR is developed by statisticians, scientists or professional analysts using the script but the reports and the results generated by them on the desktop can be easily emailed or presented in the form of presentation, but that is limiting the business use and other potential uses.\n\nIf R is incorporated with JavaScript, then web delivery can happen smoothly, and it can help in making efficient business decision making. \nIntegrating R into web application naturally becomes quintessential.\n\n<h3>Integrate R into JavaScript</h3>\nThere can be various ways through which you can integrate R with JavaScript. \nHere I am discussing the following methods that I prefer for Rand Javascript integration.\n\n<k>1. Deploy R open</k>\n<a href="https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/10/integrate-r-into-applications-with-deployr-open.html" class="whitebut ">DeployR Open</a>\nThrough Deploy R opens you can easily embed results of various R functions like- data and charts into any application. \nThis specific structure is an open source server-based system planned especially for R, which makes it simple to call the R code at a real time.\nThe workflow for this is simple: first, the programmer develops R script which is then published on the Deploy R server. \nThe published R script that can be executed from any standard application using DeployR API. \nUsing client libraries JavaScript now can make calls to the server. \nThe results returned by the call can be embedded into the displayed or processed according to the application.\n<k>2. Open CPU JavaScript API</k>\n<a href="https://www.opencpu.org/jslib.html" class="whitebut ">opencpu.js</a>\n\nThis offers straightforward RPC and information input/Output through Ajax strategies that can be fused in JavaScript of your HTML page.\n<h3>Visualization with R and JavaScript</h3>\nYou can make use of numerous JavaScript libraries that help in creating web functionality for dynamic data visualizations for R.\nHere I will be elaborating some of those tools like D3, Highchart, and leaflet. \nYou can quickly implement these tools in your R and program knowledge of JavaScript is not mandatory for this.\nAs I have already mentioned that R is an open source analytical software, it can create high dimensional data visualizations. \nGgplot2 is a standout among the most downloaded bundle that has helped R to accomplish best quality level as a data visualization tool.\nJavascript then again is a scripting dialect in which R can be consolidated to make data visualisation. \nNumerous javascript libraries can help in creating great intuitive plots, some of them are d3.Js, c3.js, vis.js, plotly.js, sigma.js, dygraphs.js.\nHTM widgets act as a bridge between R and JavaScript. \n<a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/" class="whitebut ">htmlwidgets for R</a>\nIt is the principal support for building connectors between two languages. \nThe flow of a program for HTM widgets r can be visualized as under:\n<U+2022> Information is perused into R\n<U+2022> Data is handled (and conceivably controlled) by R\n<U+2022> Data is changed over to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) arrange\n<U+2022> Information is bound to JavaScript\n<U+2022> Information is prepared (and conceivably controlled) by JavaScript\n<U+2022> Information is mapped to plotting highlights and rendered\nNow let us discuss some of the data visualization packages:\n<k><U+2022> r d3 package</k>\nData-driven documents or d3 is one of the popular JavaScript visualization libraries. \nD3 can produce visualization for almost everything including choropleths, scatter plots, graphs, network visualizations and many more. \nMultiple R packages are using only D3 plotting methods. \nYou can refer r d3 package tutorials to learn about this.\n<U+2022> <k>ggplot2</k> <br/> <br/> It is really very easy to create plots in R, but you may ask me whether it is same for creating custom plots, the answer is “yes”, and that is the primary motivation behind why ggplot came into existence. \nWith ggplot, you can make complex multi-layered designs effectively.\nHere you can start plotting with axes then add points and lines. \nBut the only drawback that it has it is relatively slower than base R, and new developers might find it difficult to learn.\n<U+2022> <k>Leaflet</k>\nThe leaflet has found its profound use in GIS (mapping), this is an open source library. \nThe R packages that backings this is composed and kept up by RStudio and ports. \nUsing this developer can create pop up text, custom zoom levels, tiles, polygon, planning and many more.\nThe ggmap bundle of javaScript can be utilised for the estimation of the latitude and longitude.\n<U+2022> <k>Lattice</k>\nLattice helps in plotting visualized multivariate data. \nHere you can have tilled plots that help in comparing values or subgroups of a given variable. \nHere you will discover numerous lattice highlights has been acquired as utilizes grid package for its usage. \nThe underlying logic used by lattice is very much similar to base R.\n<k><U+2022> visNetwork</k>\nFor the graphical representation of nodes and edges, the visual network is referred. \nVis.js is a standout amongst the most famous library among numerous that can do this sort of plotting. \nvisNetwork is the related with R package for this.\nNetwork plots ought to be finished remembering nodes and edges. \nFor visNetwork, these two should be separated into two different data frames one for the nodes and the other\n<k><U+2022> Highcarter</k>\nThis is another visualization tool which is very similar to D3. \nYou can use this tool for a variety of plots like line, spline, arealinerange, column range, polar chart and many more. \nFor the commercial use of Highcarter, you need to get a license while for the non-commercial you don’t need one.\nHighcarter library can be accessed very easily using various chart () functions. \nUsing this function, you can create a plot in a single task. \nThis function is very much similar to qplot() of ggplot2 of D3. \nchart () can produce different types of scenarios depending on the data inputs and specifications.\n<k><U+2022> RColor Brewer</k>\nWith this package, you can use color for your plots, graphs, and maps. \nThis package works nicely with schemes.\n<k><U+2022> Plotly</k>\nIt is a well distinguish podium for data visualization that works inordinately with R and Python notebook. \nIt has similarity with the high career as both are known for interactive plotting. \nBut here you get some extra as it offers something that most of the package don’t like contour plots, candlestick chart, and 3d charts.\n<U+2022> <k>SunTrust</k>\nIt is the way for representing data visualization as it nicely describes the sequence of events. \nThe diagram that it produces speaks about itself. \nYou don’t need an explanation for the chart as it is self-explanatory.\n<U+2022> <k>RGL</k>\nFor creating three-dimensional plots in R you should check out RGL. \nIt has comparability with lattice, and on the off chance that you are an accomplished R developer you will think that its simple.\n<k><U+2022> Threejs</k>\nThis is an R package and an HTML widget that helps in incorporating several data visualization from the JavaScript library.\nSome of the visualization function three are as follows:\n<U+2022> Graphjs: this is used for implementing 3D interactive data visualization. \nThis function accepts igraph as the first argument. \nThis manages definition for nodes and edges.\n<U+2022> Scatterplot3js: this function is used for creating three dimensional scatter plot.\n<U+2022> Globejs: this function of JavaScript is used for plotting surface maps and data points on earth.\n<U+2022> <k>Shiny</k>\nThe most significant benefit of JavaScript visualization is it can be implanted voluntarily into the web application. \nThey can be injected into several frameworks, one of such context of R development is shiny.\nShiny is created and maintained by R Studio. \nIt is a <a href="https://www.cuelogic.com/custom-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ugc">software application development</a> instrument, to a great extent employed for making wise interfaces with R. \nR shiny tutorial will take in more about shiny.\nShiny is a podium for facilitating R web development.\nConnecting R with javascript using libraries\nWeb scuffling has formed into an original piece of examination as through this movement you can pucker your required information. \nBut the data should be extracted before any web developer start to insert javascript render content into the web page. \nTo help in such situation R has an excellent package called V8 which acts as an interface to JavaScript. \nR v8 is the most generally utilized capacity utilized for interfacing r in javascript. \nYou can undoubtedly implement JS code in R without parting the current session. \nThe library function used for this is rvest().\nTo run the JavaScript in R, we need a context handler, within that context handler you can start programming. \nThen you can export the R data into JavaScript.\nSome other JavaScript libraries that help in analytical programming such as Linear Regression, SVMs etc. \nare as follows:\n<U+2022> Brain.js()\n<U+2022> Mljs\n<U+2022> Webdnn\n<U+2022> Convnetjs\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\nR and Javascript can practically unlock innumerable possibility in Data Science and Analytics. \nBoth technologies are working towards developing better integrations, knowledge repositories, libraries and use cases. \nIt is a good time to use both of this together. \nThe future looks bright.\n',
'<h2>Tutorial 1: R talks to JavaScript</h2>\n<h3>1.1 Basic framework</h3>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\nIn this tutorial, we go through a simple example of interacting with JavaScript(JS) in R. \n\nTo create an app, you will need a html file to display your app along with some JS to specify how the app behaves. \nAnd since we want to do all this in R, we also need R.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://kcf-jackson.github.io/jsReact/articles/articles/example_1_images/setup.png">\nDiagram 1: JS-R app setup\n\nTo make R talk to JS, you need three functions:\n\n<code>ws.send(str0)</code>(“ws” stands for “websocket”): this command lives in JS, and it sends a string to R every time it’s called. \nThe common usage is <code>ws.send(JSON.stringify(my_complex_data))</code>, where we convert the (JSON) data into a string using <code>JSON.stringify</code>; this function applies to all lists in JS.\n\n<code>ws.onmessage(msg) = function { ... }</code>: this function lives in JS. \nIt continuously monitors if R has sent JS a message, and it runs the code in the body when it gets a message. \n\nThe message contains many things other than your data, and we can use <code>JSON.parse(msg.data)</code> to extract the data from it.\n\nYour R function (well, clearly) lives in R. \nIt describes what R should do when JS sends R some data. \nThe input is assumed to be a named list, and the output must also be a named list.\n\nThe following is a common pattern to use. \nIt is very flexible; in fact, all examples in the package are created under this framework. \nAdditional patterns can be created, but we shall leave that to another tutorial.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://kcf-jackson.github.io/jsReact/articles/articles/example_1_images/basic_framework.png">\n\nDiagram 2: JS-R communication model\n<h3>Two simple examples</h3>\n<h4>Example 1</h4>\n\nJavaScript\n\n<code>ws.send("hi");\nws.onmessage = function(msg) {\n  var r_data = JSON.parse(msg.data);\n  console.log(r_data[\'r_msg\']);   // this prints the message in JS console\n}</code>\n\nR\n<code>my_r_function = function(msg) {\n  print(msg)  # this will print the message in R console\n  list(r_msg = msg)  # return the message to JS\n}</code>\n\n<h4>Example 2</h4>\n\nJavaScript\n<code>ws.send("JSON.stringify({x:3, y:4})");    // sends a named list in JS to R\nws.onmessage = function(msg) {\n  var r_data = JSON.parse(msg.data);\n  console.log(r_data[\'r_msg\'], r_data[\'z\']);   // this prints the message in JS console\n}</code>\n\nR\n<code>my_r_function = function(msg) {\n  print(msg)   # this will print the message in R console\n  print(msg$x) # expects 3\n  print(msg$y) # expects 4\n  list(r_msg = msg, z = rnorm(1))  # return the message to JS\n}</code>\n\n<h3>1.2 Our first app</h3>\nNow we are ready to create our first app, which looks like this:\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://kcf-jackson.github.io/jsReact/articles/articles/gif_images/example.gif" style="width:50.0%">\nThe goal is to get ourselves familiar with the JS-R communication model and the whole app development process. \nThe full code can be found <a href="https://github.com/kcf-jackson/jsReact/blob/master/inst/example.R">here</a>.\n\n<h3>1.2.1 App interface</h3>\nFirst, let’s inspect the interface.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://kcf-jackson.github.io/jsReact/articles/articles/example_1_images/app_interface.png" style="width:50.0%">\nTwo comments to make:\n\nTo create a slider, you need to specify these three attributes: <code>min, max, oninput</code>. \n<code>min, max</code> refers to the minimum and maximum value the slider can take; <code>oninput</code> refers to a function which describes the desired behaviour when the slider is moved.\n\nIn html, most things are just containers with different defaults. \nContainers are referred to as <code>&lt;div></code> elements.\n\n<h3>1.2.2 Code</h3>\nNext, let’s decompose and analyse the codes.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://kcf-jackson.github.io/jsReact/articles/articles/example_1_images/codes.png" style="width:80.0%">\n# Example 1.

The library works on all modern browsers, and lays the foundations for building scalable R web applications.\n<h4>Apps<small><em> a€” develop, ship and deploy standalone R web applications</em></small></h4>\nThe opencpu.js library is primarly designed for developing apps. An app is an R package which includes web page(s) that call R functions in the package through the OpenCPU API. Thereby you can easily package, ship and deploy portable, standalone R web applications. A repository of public OpenCPU apps is available at <a href="http://github.com/opencpu" target="_blank">http://github.com/opencpu</a>. Because apps are simply R packages, they are installed just like any other R package:\n\n<code>#install apps: \'stocks\', \'markdownapp\' and \'nabel\'\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(c("stocks", "markdownapp", "nabel"), username="opencpu")</code>\nBy convention, the web pages are placed in the <code>/inst/www/</code> directory in the R package. To use an app locally, simply start the opencpu single-user server:\n\n<code>library(opencpu)\nopencpu$browse("/library/stocks/www")\nopencpu$browse("/library/nabel/www")</code>\nThe same apps can be installed and accessed on a cloud server by navigating to <code>/ocpu/library/[pkgname]/www/</code>:\n\n<a href="https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/stocks/www" target="_blank">https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/stocks/www</a>\n\n<a href="https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/markdownapp/www" target="_blank">https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/markdownapp/www</a>\n\n<a href="https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/nabel/www" target="_blank">https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/nabel/www</a>\nOne app in the public repository is called <a href="https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/appdemo/www">appdemo</a>. This application contains some minimal examples to demonstrate basic functionality and help you get started with building apps using <code>opencpu.js</code>.\n\n<h4>OpenCPU and jQuery<small><em>  a€” loading the libraries</em></small></h4>\nThe latest version of <code>opencpu.js</code> is available from github: <a href="https://github.com/jeroenooms/opencpu.js">https://github.com/jeroenooms/opencpu.js</a>. The jQuery library must be included in your web page <k>before</k> opencpu.js, because one depends on the other. Your application code must be included <k>after</k> opencpu.js.\n<code>&lt;script src="js/jquery.js">&lt;/script>\n&lt;script src="js/opencpu.js">&lt;/script>\n\n&lt;script src="js/app.js">&lt;/script></code>\nIt is recommended to ship a copy of the <code>opencpu.js</code> library with your application or website (as opposed to hotlinking it from some public location). This because the JavaScript library is in active development (0.x version) and the latest version might (radically) change from time to time. Shipping a version of <code>opencpu.js</code> with your app prevents it from breaking with upstream changes in the library. Also it is practical both for development and deployment if your app works offline.\nMost functions in opencpu.js call out to <code>$.ajax</code> and return the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a> object. Thereby you (the programmer) have full control over the request. Note that the A in Ajax stands for <k>asynchronous</k>, which means each ajax request returns immediately. Server responses are processed using <k>callback functions</k>. This paradigm can be a bit confusing to R users, but it results in flexible, non-blocking applications. If you are new to jQuery, at least familiarize yourself with the <code>jqXHR.done</code>, <code>jqXHR.fail</code> and <code>jqXHR.always</code> methods (see <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a>). \n<h4>CORS<small><em>  a€” cross-domain opencpu requests</em></small></h4>\n\nThe recommended design for OpenCPU apps is to include the web pages in the R package. This results in a standalone application, which is easy to distribute and deploy and can also be used offline. Furthermore, it guarantees that the version of front-end and R code are in sync, and the package manager automatically takes care of dependencies when the app is installed on a server. \nHowever it is also possible to use the <code>opencpu.js</code> library from an external site that is not hosted on OpenCPU. In this case, we must specify the external OpenCPU server using <code>ocpu.seturl()</code>:\n<code>//set page to communicate to with "mypackage" on server below\nocpu.seturl("//cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/mypackage/R")</code>\n\nCross domain requests are convenient for development and illustrative examples, see e.g: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/user/opencpu/fiddles/">jsfiddle examples</a>. However, when possible it is still recommended to include a copy of your web pages in the R package for every release of your app. That way you get a nice redistributable app and there is no ambiguity over version compatibility of the front-end (web pages) and back-end (R functions). \nAlso note that even when using CORS, the <code>opencpu.js</code> library still requires that all R functions used by a certain application are contained in a single R package. This is on purpose, to force you to keep things organized. If you would like to use functionality from various R packages, you need to create an R package that includes some wrapper functions and formally declares its dependencies on the other packages. Writing an R package is really easy these days, so this should be no problem. \n<h4>JSfiddle<small><em>  a€” fiddle around with some examples</em></small></h4>\nSince OpenCPU now supports CORS, and so do all major browsers, we started using JSfiddle to illustrate how to use the library. The <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/user/opencpu/fiddles/">opencpu jsfiddle</a> homepage lists all our fiddles, and we will keep adding new examples. Many of these examples are actually referenced and explained in this manual page. But if this is all tl;dr, just <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/user/opencpu/fiddles/">start playing</a>.\n\n<h3>Stateless functions</h3>\nThis chapter describes two high-level functions that are used to call R functions that generate either a plot or return some data. They are easy to use because they directly take the output from the R function; no session management is required.\n <!-- Default panel contents -->\n<h4>The Plot Widget <small><em>  a€” generate an R plot in a div</em></small></h4>\n\n  \n<h3><tt>$("#mydiv").rplot( fun, [, args ] [, callback ]) Returns: <a target="_blank" href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR"><code>jqXHR</code></a> </tt></h3>\n  \n  \n\n  <k>fun</k> <tt>(string)</tt> \nName of the R function <em>(required)</em> <hr>\n  <k>args</k> <tt>(object)</tt> \nFunction arguments. <hr>\n  <k>callback</k> <tt>(function)</tt> \nCallback function. Not needed for plot widget. Called with session object.\n  \n\nA fun an easy way to get started is by making plots. The <code>opencpu.js</code> library implements a jquery plugin called <code>rplot</code> which makes it easy to embed live plots in your webpage. For example, consider the R function <a href="http://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/stocks/R/smoothplot">smoothplot</a> in the <a href="http://github.com/opencpu/stocks">stocks package</a>:\n<code>#The R function\nfunction(ticker = "GOOG", from = "2013-01-01", to=Sys.time()){\n  mydata = yahoodata(ticker, from, to);\n\n  qplot(Date, Close, data = mydata, geom = c("line", "smooth"));\n}</code>\nIt defines three arguments, each of which optional: <code>ticker</code>, <code>from</code>, and <code>to</code>. These are the arguments that we can pass from the <code>opencpu.js</code> client app. In this example, we only pass the first two arguments.\n<code>//JavaScript client code\n\nvar ticker = $("#ticker").val();\nvar req = $("#plotdiv").rplot("smoothplot", {\nticker : ticker,\nfrom : "2013-01-01"\n\n})\n//optional: add custom callbacks\nreq.fail(function(){\nalert("R returned an error: " + req.responseText);\n\n});</code>\nThis creates a plot widget in the <code>#plotdiv</code> element (a div in your html). It calls the R function <code>smoothplot</code> and passes argument values as specified, and displays the generated plot including PNG, PDF, and SVG export links. The final lines specify an error handler, which is optional but recommended. Have a look at the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/MkAVF/">jsfiddle</a>, or the full <a href="https://cloud.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/stocks/www/">stocks app</a> to see all of this in action!\n<!-- Default panel contents -->\n<h4>Basic JSON RPC <small><em>  a€” a.k.a Data Processing Unit</em></small></h4>\n\n  \n<h3><tt>ocpu.rpc( fun, [, args ] [, complete ] ) Returns: <a target="_blank" href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR"><code>jqXHR</code></a> </tt></h3>\n  \n  \n\n  <k>fun</k> <tt>(string)</tt> \nName of the R function <em>(required)</em> <hr>\n  <k>args</k> <tt>(object)</tt> \nFunction arguments. <hr>\n  <k>complete</k> <tt>(function)</tt> \nCallback function. Is called only on success with one arg: R function return value.\n  \n\nWith opencpu.js we can use R as a remote calculator. Consider the very simple example of calculating the standard deviation for a vector of numbers. In this case we call the default R function sd in the stats package\n<code>var mydata = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15];\n//call R function: stats::sd(x=data)\nvar req = ocpu.rpc("sd",{\n\nx : mydata\n}, function(output){\nalert("Standard Deviation equals: " + output);\n});\n\n//optional\nreq.fail(function(){\nalert("R returned an error: " + req.responseText);\n});</code>\n\nSee it in action <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/T3cqH/">here</a>. When calling <code>ocpu.rpc</code>, the arguments as well as return value are transferred using JSON. On the R side, the <code>jsonlite</code> package is used to convert between JSON and R objects. Hence, the above code is equivalent to the R code below. The <code>output</code> object is a JSON string which is sent back to the client and parsed by JavaScript.\n<code>library(jsonlite)\n#parse input from JSON into R\njsoninput = \'{"x" : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]}\'\n\nfnargs = fromJSON(jsoninput)\n#the actual function call\nresult = do.call(stats::sd, fnargs)\n#convert result back to JSON\n\njsonoutput = toJSON(result)</code>\nAnother example is available here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/9nVd5/">http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/9nVd5/</a>. This example calls the <code>lowess</code> function in R, to smooth a bunch of values. This can be useful to remove outliers from noisy data. One difference with the previous example, is that <code>lowess</code> does not return a single value, but a list with two vectors: <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. See the lowess help page for more detail.\n<h3>Calls and Sessions</h3>\nThe stateless functions are convenient for applications with a single R function call and a single output (either a plot or the function return value). However, other applications might require more sophisticated interaction with the R session. This section section talks about stateful applications; i.e. the client creates and manipulates objects on the server. Therefore, the difference with before is that calling functions (POST) is decoupled from retrieving output (GET).\n\n<!-- Default panel contents -->\n<h4>State in OpenCPU<small><em>  a€” managing sessions</em></small></h4>\nManagement of state in OpenCPU is quite different from what R users are used to, which can be confusing at first. In OpenCPU, the client does <k>not</k> have a single private R process on the server which handles all incoming requests, such as in e.g. Shiny or in an R terminal session. Instead, OpenCPU is plain HTTP, and therefore each requests is anonymous and <em>stateless</em>. After every function call, OpenCPU cleans (or kills) the R process that was used to handle the request. \n However, all outputs of every function call, such as return value, graphics, stdout or files in working directory, are stored on the server, and a <k>session ID</k> is returned to the client. These session IDs can be used to control these outputs on the server in future requests. For example, a client can retrieve outputs in various formats, share them with others, or use stored R objects as arguments in subsequent function calls. Hence to build a <em>statefull</em> application, there is no point in assigning objects to the global environment. Instead, we need to design R functions to return the value of interest. This way the client can call the function, and use its return value in subsequent function calls. \n\nThis design has several advantages that are important for scalable applications:\n\nNon blocking: everything is async, your GUI won\'t block while waiting for R to return.\n\nRobustness: if an R call gets stuck, errors or crashes, it doesn\'t take down your application.\n\nConcurrency: applications are parallel by design. Clients can perform simultaneous requests and combine results later.\n\n<!-- Default panel contents -->\n<h4>Call an R function <small><em>  a€” decouple call from output</em></small></h4>\n\n <h3><tt>ocpu.call( fun, [, args ] [, callback ] ) Returns: <a target="_blank" href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR"><code>jqXHR</code></a> </tt></h3>\n<k>fun</k> <tt>(string)</tt> \nName of the R function <em>(required)</em> <hr>\n<k>args</k> <tt>(object)</tt> \nFunction arguments. <hr>\n<k>callback</k> <tt>(function)</tt> \nCallback function. 1 argument: Session object.\n\n  \nThe <code>ocpu.call</code> function is the stateful equivalent of <code>ocpu.rpc</code>. It has the same arguments, but the difference is in the callback function. The <code>ocpu.rpc</code> callback argument is a JSON object containing the data returned by the R function. The <code>ocpu.call</code> callback argument is a <em>Session object</em>. The session object is a javascript class that stores the session ID; it does not contain any actual data. However, from the session object, we can asynchronously retrieve data, plots, files, stdout, etc. See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/tmqab/">this jsfiddle</a> in action.\n<code>//toy example\nvar req = ocpu.call("rnorm", {n: 100}, function(session){\n\n//read the session properties (just for fun)\n$("#key").text(session.getKey());\n$("#location").text(session.getLoc());\n//retrieve session console (stdout) async\n\nsession.getConsole(function(outtxt){\n    $("#output").text(outtxt);\n});\n//retrieve the returned object async\n\nsession.getObject(function(data){\n    //data is the object returned by the R function\n    alert("Array of length " + data.length + "./nFirst few values:" + data.slice(0,3));\n});\n\n})</code>\nWe can also use the Session object to pass the R value returned by the function call as an argument to a subsequent function call, without ever retrieving the object. All state in OpenCPU is managed by controlling R objects in sessions on the server. This <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/ecwbd/">jsfiddle example</a> continues on the previous example, and calculates the variance of the vector generated before, by passing the session object as an argument. A more simple example <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/mH52T/">here</a>\n<code>var req1 = ocpu.call("rnorm", {n: 100}, function(session1){\nvar req2 = ocpu.call("var", {x : session1}, function(session2){\n\n    session2.getObject(function(data){\n        alert("Variance equals: " + data);\n    });\n});\n\n});</code>\n<!-- Default panel contents -->\n<h4>Argument Types <small><em>  a€” passing data to opencpu</em></small></h4>\nIn <code>opencpu.js</code> there are 4 types of arguments: a basic JavaScript value/object (automatically converted to R via JSON), a session object (represents an R value from a previous function call), a file and a code snippet. We have already seen examples the first two argument types earlier. Below is an example of using a file as an argument. The file will automatically be uploaded and used to call the R function. See it in action using <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/5Rqcm/">this jsfiddle</a>.\n\n<code>//This must be HTML5 &lt;input type="file">\nvar myfile = $("#csvfile")[0].files[0];\nvar header = true;\n//call read.csv in R. File is automatically uploaded\n\nvar req = ocpu.call("read.csv", {\n"file" : myfile,\n"header" : myheader\n}, function(session){\n\n//use output here\n});</code>\nThe final type of argument is a code snippet. This injects raw R code into the function call. It is usually recommended to use this type only when really needed, because it requires the client to understand R code, which kills interoperability. But this argument type is useful for example in applications that explicitly let the user do some R coding. See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/4dgdM/">here</a> for a basic example: \n<code>//create snippet argument\n\nvar x = new ocpu.Snippet($("#input").val());\n//perform the request\nvar req = ocpu.call("mean", {\n"x" : x\n\n}, function(session){\n//use output here\n});</code>\nOne interesting special case is using a code Snippet when calling the <code>identity</code> function in R. This comes down to executing a raw block of code in a session. Try <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/opencpu/v42v3/">this jsfiddle</a> to see this in action.\n\n   \n<!-- Default panel contents -->\n<h4>The Session Object <small><em>  a€” controlling objects, plots, files, etc</em></small></h4>\nThe callback argument for <code>ocpu.call()</code> is always a session object. This object does not contain actual data, it just holds a sessoin ID and which can be used to retrieve output from the server. All session objects have the following methods:\n\n <h3><tt>session.getKey() Returns: string </tt></h3>\nRead the session ID. For debugging only.\n  \n <h3><tt>session.getLoc() Returns: string </tt></h3>\nRead the session URL. For debugging only.\n  \n <h3><tt>session.getFileURL( path ) Returns: string </tt></h3>\n<k>path</k> <tt>(string)</tt> \nPath of the file w.r.t. working directory. <em>(required)</em>\n\n  \nThe methods below initiate an ajax request and return the jqXHR object.

Unlike traditional plotting methods, like barplots and boxplots, a pirateplot is an RDI plotting trifecta which presents Raw data (all data as points), Descriptive statistics (as a horizontal line at the mean &#8212; or any other function you wish), and Inferential statistics (95% Bayesian Highest Density Intervals, and smoothed densities).\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pirateplot-elements.png" target="_blank">\nFor a full guide to the package, check out the package guide at CRAN \n<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yarrr/vignettes/guide.html" onclick="_gaq.push([\'_trackEvent\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yarrr/vignettes/guide.html\', \'here\']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.\nFor now, here are some examples of pirateplots showing off some the package updates.\n<h3>Up to 3 IVs</h3>\nYou can now include up to three independent variables in your pirateplot. The first IV is presented as adjacent beans, the second is presented in different groups of beans in the same plot, and the third IV is shown in separate plots.\nHere is a pirateplot of the heights of pirates based on three separate IVs: headband (whether the pirate wears a headband or not), sex, and eyepatch (whether the pirate wears an eye patch or not):\n\npirateplot(formula = height ~ sex + headband + eyepatch,\n  point.o = .1,  data = pirates)\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/threeivpp-1.png">\nHere, we can see that male pirates tend to be the tallest, but there there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a difference between those who wear headbands or not, and those who have eye patches or not.\n\n<h3>New color palettes</h3>\nThe updated package has a few fun new color palettes contained in the piratepal() function. The first, called &#8216;xmen&#8217;, is inspired by my 90s Saturday morning cartoon nostalgia. \n# Display the xmen palette\npiratepal(palette = "xmen",  trans = .1, # Slightly transparent colors     plot.result = TRUE)\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/xmen_display-1.png">\nHere, I&#8217;ll use the xmen palette to plot the distribution of the weights of chickens over time (if someone has a more suitable dataset for the xmen palette let me know!):\npirateplot(formula = weight ~ Time,       data = ChickWeight,       main = "Weights of chickens by Time",      pal = "xmen",       gl.col = "gray")\nmtext(text = "Using the xmen palette!",  side = 3,  font = 3)\n\nmtext(text = "*The mean and variance of chicken/nweights tend to increase over time.",  side = 1,  adj = 1, line = 3.5, font = 3, cex = .7)\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/xmen_chikens.png">\nThe second palette called &#8220;pony&#8221; is inspired by the Bronys in our IT department.\n# Display the pony palette\npiratepal(palette = "pony",  trans = .1, # Slightly transparent colors     plot.result = TRUE)\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pony_image.png">\nHere, I&#8217;ll plot the distribution of the lengths of movies as a function of their MPAA ratings (where G is for suitable for children, and R is suitable for adults)\npirateplot(formula= time ~ rating,       data = subset(movies, time > 0 & rating %in% c("G", "PG", "PG-13", "R")),       pal = "pony",       point.o = .05,       bean.o = 1,       main = "Movie times by rating",       bean.lwd = 2,       gl.col = "gray")\n\nmtext(text = "Using the pony palette!",  side = 3,  font = 3)\nmtext(text = "*Movies rated for children/n(G and PG) tend to be longer /nthan those rated for adults",  side = 1,  adj = 1, font = 3, line = 3.5, cex = .7)\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pony_times.png">\nTo see all of the palettes (including those inspired by movies and a transit map of Basel), just run the function with &#8220;all&#8221; as the main argument\n\npiratepal(palette = "all")\nOf course, if you find that these color palettes give you a headache, you can always set the plot to grayscale (or any other color), by specifying a single color in the palette argument. Here, I&#8217;ll create a grayscale pirateplot showing the distribution of movie budgets by their creative type:\npirateplot(formula = budget ~ creative.type,       data = subset(movies, budget > 0 &                     creative.type %in% c("Multiple Creative Types", "Factual") == FALSE),      point.o = .02,      xlab = "Movie Creative Type",      main = "Movie budgets (in millions) by rating",      gl.col = "gray",      pal = "black")\nmtext("Using a grayscale pirateplot",  side = 3,  font = 3)\n\nmtext("*Superhero movies tend to have the highest budgets/n...by far!",  side = 1, adj = 1, line = 3,  cex = .8, font = 3)\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moviebudgetpp.png">\nLooks like super hero movies have the highest budgets&#8230;by far!\n<h3>Acknowledgements and Comments</h3>\nThe pirateplot is largely inspired by the great beanplot package (\n<a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/beanplot/index.html">beanplot package link</a>)\nBayesian 95% HDIs are calculated using the truly amazing BayesFactor package (\n<a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesFactor/index.html">BayesFactor package link)</a>\nThe latest developer version of yarrr is always available at \n<a href = "https://github.com/ndphillips/yarrr">https://github.com/ndphillips/yarrr</a>.

deal with statistics-heavy projects and explore datasets. \nIt can be used for UX monitoring, data-based predictions, and much more. \nSome say the R programming language can do everything and we’re not going to disprove such a bold claim. \n\nWhat we’re interested in is how you can share the results of your R-based analysis with different stakeholders. \nOf all possible channels for this, email is the most common one. \nSo, let’s explore multiple ways of how to send an email with R.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-1">Packages for sending emails from R</h3>\nHere are the R packages you can use for sending emails:\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><k>Package</k></td><td><k>Description</k></td><td><k>Latest version</k></td><td><k>Dependency</k></td></tr><tr><td><a

options.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-2">Sending emails in R via SMTP</h3>\nWhichever R package of the following you choose, keep in mind that you need to have an SMTP server to send emails. \nIn our examples, we’ll be using Mailtrap, a service providing a fake SMTP server for testing. \n<h3 id="emailtopic-3">sendmailR</h3>\n<k>sendmailR</k> can be used for sending all sorts of email notifications such as completed jobs and scheduled tasks. \n\nAt the same time, you can distribute analytical results to stakeholders using this R package as well. \nsendmailR is mostly used for SMTP servers without authentication. \nThat’s why we won’t use Mailtrap in the following examples. \nLet’s install the package first:\n\n<code>install.packages("sendmailR",repos="http://cran.r-project.org")</code>\nNext, we create a data structure called Server, which is a map with a single key value pair – key: <code>smtpServer</code>, value: <code>smtp.example.io</code>: \n<code>Server=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io")</code>\nNow, let’s write a few R lines to send a simple email:\n\n<code>library(sendmailR)\nfrom = sprintf("&lt;user@sender.com>","The Sender") # the sender’s name is an optional value\nto = sprintf("&lt;user@recipient.com>")\nsubject = "Test email subject"\n\nbody = "Test email body"\nsendmail(from,to,subject,body,control=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io"))</code>\nThe following code sample is for sending an email to multiple recipients:\n<code>from = sprintf("&lt;user@sender.com>","The Sender")\n\nto =sprintf(c("&lt;user@recipient.com>","&lt;user2@recipient.com>", "&lt;user3@recipient.com>")\nsubject = "Test email subject"\nbody = "Test email body"\nsapply(to,function(x) sendmail(from,to=x,subject,body,control=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io"))</code>\n\nAnd now, let’s send an email with an attachment as well:\n<code>from = sprintf("&lt;user@sender.com>","The Sender")\nto = sprintf("&lt;user@recipient.com>")\nsubject = "Test email subject"\n\nbody = "Test email body"\nattachmentPath ="C:/.../Attachment.png"\nattachmentObject =mime_part(x=attachmentPath,name=attachmentName)\nbodyWithAttachment = list(body,attachmentObject)\n\nsendmail(from,to,subject,bodyWithAttachment,control=list(smtpServer= "smtp.example.io"))</code>\n<em>NB: To send emails with </em><k><em>sendmailR</em></k><em>, you may also need to configure your machine so it can send emails from your local host. \nWe’ve covered this step in </em><a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/setup-smtp-server/" target="_blank"><em>How To Set Up An SMTP Server</em></a><em>.</em>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-4">mailR</h3>\nIf you employ an authentication-based SMTP server, you’d better pick the <k>mailR </k>package. \nIt’s a wrapper around Apache Commons Email, an email library built on top of the Java Mail API. \nDue to this, <k>mailR</k> has a dependency on the rJava package, a low-level interface to Java VM. \nThis requires Java Runtime Environment to be installed. \n\nYou can download it from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a>. \nIn case of problems with pointing to the right Java binary, refer to <a href="https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/151" target="_blank">this troubleshooting guide</a> on GitHub. \nIn practice, this may cause a bit of trouble when deploying in some environments. \nNevertheless, mailR is a rather popular solution to automate sending emails with the R that offers the following:\n\nmultiple recipients (Cc, Bcc, and ReplyTo)\nmultiple attachments (both from the file system and URLs)\nHTML formatted emails\nInstall the package:\n<code>install.packages("mailR",repos="http://cran.r-project.org")</code>\nNow, we can use the Mailtrap SMTP server that requires authentication to send an email:\n\n<code>library(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = "user@recipient.com",\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n\n    body = "Test emails body",\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n    send = TRUE)</code>\nInsert your Mailtrap credentials (<code>user.name</code> and <code>passwd</code>) and pick any SMTP port of 25, 465, 587, 2525.\nHere is how to send an email to multiple recipients:\n\n<code>library(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = c("Recipient 1 &lt;user1@recipient.com>", "Recipient 2 &lt;user@recipient.com>"),\n    cc = c("CC Recipient &lt;cc.user@recipient.com>"),\n\n    bcc = c("BCC Recipient &lt;bcc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    replyTo = c("Reply to Recipient &lt;reply-to@recipient.com>"),\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "Test emails body",\n\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n\n    send = TRUE)</code>\nNow, let’s add a few attachments to the email:\n<code>library(mailR)\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n\n    to = c("Recipient 1 &lt;user1@recipient.com>", "Recipient 2 &lt;user@recipient.com>"),\n    cc = c("CC Recipient &lt;cc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    bcc = c("BCC Recipient &lt;bcc.user@recipient.com>"),\n    replyTo = c("Reply to Recipient &lt;reply-to@recipient.com>"),\n\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "Test emails body",\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n    send = TRUE,\n    attach.files = c("./attachment.png", "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/123456/Attachment.pdf"),\n\n    file.names = c("Attachment.png", "Attachment.pdf"), #this is an optional parameter\n    file.descriptions = c("Description for Attachment.png", "Description for Attachment.pdf")) #this is an optional parameter</code>\nEventually, let’s send an HTML email from R:\n<code>library(mailR)\n\nsend.mail(from = "user@sender.com",\n    to = "user@recipient.com",\n    subject = "Test email subject",\n    body = "&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>",\n\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io", port = 25,\n          user.name = "********",\n          passwd = "******", ssl = TRUE),\n    authenticate = TRUE,\n\n    send = TRUE)</code>\nYou can also point to an HTML template by specifying its location, as follows:\n<code>body = "./Template.html",</code>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-5">blastula</h3>\nThe <k>blastula</k> package allows you to craft and send responsive HTML emails in R programming. \nWe’ll review how to send emails via the SMTP server, however, <k>blastula </k>also supports the Mailgun API.\nInstall the package:\n<code>install.packages("blastula",repos="http://cran.r-project.org")</code>\n\nand load it:\n<code>library(blastula)</code>\nCompose an email using Markdown formatting. \nYou can also employ the following string objects:\n\n<code>add_readable_time</code> – creates a nicely formatted date/time string for the current time\n\n<code>add_image</code> – transforms an image to an HTML string object\nFor example,\n<code>date_time = add_readable_time() # => "Thursday, November 28, 2019 at 4:34 PM (CET)"\n\nimg_file_path = "./attachment.png" # => "&lt;img cid=/"mtwhxvdnojpr__attachment.png/" src=/"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...g==/" width=/"520/" alt=/"/"/>/n"\nimg_string = add_image(file = img_file_path)</code>\nWhen composing an email, you will need the <code>c()</code> function to combine the strings in the email body and footer.\nYou can use three main arguments: <code>body</code>, <code>header</code>, and <code>footer</code>. \n\nIf you have Markdown and HTML fragments in the email body, use the <code>md()</code> function. \nHere is what we’ve got:\n<code>library(blastula)\nemail =\ncompose_email(\n  body = md(\n    c("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>", img_string )\n    ),\n footer = md(\n    c("Test email footer", date_time, "." )\n  )\n)</code>\n\nPreview the email using <code>attach_connect_email(email = email)</code>\nNow, let’s send the email. \nThis can be done with the <code>smtp_send()</code> function through one of the following ways:\n\nProviding the SMTP credentials directly via the <code>creds()</code> helper:\n<code>smtp_send(\n  email = email,\n  from = "user@sender.com",\n  to = "user@recipient.com",\n  credentials = creds(\n    host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n    port = 25,\n    user = "********"\n  )\n)</code>\n\nUsing a credentials key that you can generate with the <code>create_smtp_creds_key()</code> function:<code>create_smtp_creds_key(\n  id = "mailtrap",\n  host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n  port = 25,\n  user = "********"\n)\nsmtp_send(\n  email = email,\n  from = "user@sender.com",\n  to = "user@recipient.com",\n  credentials = creds_key("mailtrap")\n)</code>\n\nUsing a credentials file that you can generate with the <code>create_smtp_creds_file()</code> function:\n<code>create_smtp_creds_file(\n  file = "mailtrap_file",\n  host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n  port = 25,\n  user = "********"\n)\nsmtp_send(\n  email = email,\n  from = "user@sender.com",\n  to = "user@recipient.com",\n  credentials = creds_file("mailtrap_file")\n)</code>\n\n<em>NB: There is no way to programmatically specify a password for authentication. \nThe user will be prompted to provide one during code execution.</em>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-6">emayili</h3>\n<k>emayili </k>is the last package on our list for sending emails in R via SMTP. \n\nThe package works with all SMTP servers and has minimal dependencies. \nInstall it from GitHub and let’s move on:\n<code>install.packages("remotes")\nlibrary(remotes)\nremotes::install_github("datawookie/emayili")</code>\nEmayili has two classes at the core:\n\n<code>envelope</code> – to create emails\n<code>server</code> – to communicate with the SMTP server\nLet’s create an email first:\n\n<code>library(emayili)\nemail = envelope() %>%\n  from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  body("Test email body")</code>\nNow, configure the SMTP server:\n<code>smtp = server(host = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n         port = 25,\n         username = "********",\n         password = "*********")</code>\nTo send the email to multiple recipients, enhance your emails with Cc, Bcc, and Reply-To header fields as follows:\n\n<code>email = envelope() %>%\n  from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  to(c("Recipient 1 &lt;user1@recipient.com>", "Recipient 2 &lt;user@recipient.com>")) %>%\n  cc("cc@recipient.com") %>%\n  bcc("bcc@recipient.com") %>%\n  reply("reply-to@recipient.com") %>%\n  subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  body("Test email body")</code>\n\nYou can also use the <code>attachment()</code> method to add attachments to your email:\n<code>email = email %>% attachment(c("./attachment.png",

Gmail API – gmailR</h3>\nToday, Gmail is one of the most popular email services. \nIt provides RESTful API for a bunch of functionalities, such as:\n\nsend/receive HTML emails with attachments\nCRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations with messages, drafts, threads, and labels\naccess control of your Gmail inbox\nand so on\n\nFor sending emails from R via Gmail API, you need two things: the <k>gmailR</k> package and the API access. \nLet’s start with the latest, which requires four steps to be done:\n\nCreate a project in the Google API Console\nEnable Gmail API\nSet up credentials and authentication with OAuth 2.0\nDownload a JSON file with your credentialsWe’ve described all these steps in <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/send-emails-with-gmail-api/" target="_blank">How to send emails with Gmail API</a>, so feel free to reference this blog post. \n\nAfter you’ve accomplished the preparation stage, get back to <k>gmailR</k>. \nThe package is available on CRAN, so you can install, as follows:\n<code>install.packages("gmailr", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")</code>\nand load in your R script:\n\n<code>library(gmailr)</code>\nNow, you can use your downloaded JSON credentials file. \nEmploy the <code>use_secret_file()</code> function. \nFor example, if your JSON file is named <em>GmailCredentials.json</em>, this will look, as follows:\n\n<code>use_secret_file("GmailCredentials.json")</code>\nAfter that, create a MIME email object:\n<code>email = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_text_body("Test email body")</code>\nTo create an HTML email, use markup to shape your HTML string, for example:\n\n<code>email = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>")</code>\nTo add an attachment, you can:\n\nuse the <code>gm_attach_file()</code> function, if the attachment has not been loaded into R. \nYou can specify the MIME type yourself using the type parameter or let it be automatically guessed by <code>mime::guess_type</code>\n\n<code>email = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>") %>%\n  gm_attach_file("Attachment.png")</code>\n\nuse <code>attach_part()</code> to attach the binary data to your file:\n<code>email = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body("&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>") %>%\n\n  gm_attach_part(part = charToRaw("attach me!"), name = "please")</code>\nIf you need to include an image into HTML, you can use the <code>&lt;img class="lazy" data-src=”cid:xy”></code> tag to reference the image. \nFirst create a plot to send, and save it to <em>AttachImage.png</em>:\n<code># 1. \n\nuse built-in mtcars data set\nmy_data = mtcars\n# 2. \nOpen file for writing\npng("AttachImage.png", width = 350, height = 350)\n# 3. \nCreate the plot\nplot(x = my_data$wt, y = my_data$mpg,\n  pch = 16, frame = FALSE,\n  xlab = "wt", ylab = "mpg", col = "#2E9FDF")\n# 4. \nClose the file\ndev.off()</code>\nNow, create an HTML email that references the plot as <code>foobar</code>:\n<code>email = gm_mime() %>%\n  gm_to("user@recipient.com") %>%\n\n  gm_from("user@sender.com") %>%\n  gm_subject("Test email subject") %>%\n  gm_html_body(\n    \'&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>\n\n    &lt;br>&lt;img class="lazy" data-src="cid:foobar">\'\n  ) %>%\n  gm_attach_file("AttachImage.png", id = "foobar")</code>\nEventually, you can send your email:\n\n<code>gm_send_message(email)</code>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-8">Sending emails from Outlook – RDCOMClient</h3>\nR has a package for sending emails from Microsoft Outlook as well. \nIt’s called <k>RDCOMClient </k>and allows you to connect to DCOM architecture, which you can consider an API for communicating with Microsoft Office in Windows environments. \n\nLet’s explore how to connect R to the Outlook app installed on your Windows.\nInstall <k>RDCOMClient </k>via an option of your choice:\n\nfrom CRAN:\n<code>install.packages("RDCOMClient")</code>\n\nvia devtools:\n<code>devtools::install_github("omegahat/RDCOMClient")</code>\n\nfrom the Windows command line:\n<code>R CMD INSTALL RDCOMClient</code>\n\n<em>Warning: if you receive a message like <code>package ‘RDCOMClient’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)</code>” during the installation from CRAN, try to install </em><k><em>RDCOMClient </em></k><em>from the source repository:</em>\n<code>install.packages("RDCOMClient", repos = "http://www.omegahat.net/R")</code>\nLoad the package, open Outlook, and create a simple email:\n<code>library(RDCOMClient)\n\nOutlook = COMCreate("Outlook.Application")\nEmail = Outlook$CreateItem(0)\nEmail[["to"]] = "user@recipient.com"\nEmail[["subject"]] = "Test email subject"\n\nEmail[["body"]] = "Test email body"</code>\nIf you need to change the default <code>From:</code> field and send from a secondary mailbox, use:\n<code>Email[["SentOnBehalfOfName"]] = "user@sender.com"</code>\nHere is how you can specify multiple recipients, as well as Cc and Bcc headers:\n\n<code>Email[["to"]] = "user1@recipient.com, user2@recipient.com"\nEmail[["cc"]] = "cc.user@recipient.com"\nEmail[["bcc"]] = "bcc.user@recipient.com"</code>\nTo create an HTML email, use <code>[["htmlbody"]]</code>. \n\nYou can simply add your HTML in the R code as follows:\n<code>library(RDCOMClient)\nOutlook = COMCreate("Outlook.Application")\nEmail = Outlook$CreateItem(0)\n\nEmail[["to"]] = "user@recipietn.com"\nEmail[["subject"]] = "Test email subject"\nEmail[["htmlbody"]] =\n"&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>"</code>\n\nLet’s also add an attachment:\n<code>library(RDCOMClient)\nOutlook = COMCreate("Outlook.Application")\nEmail = Outlook$CreateItem(0)\n\nEmail[["to"]] = "user@recipient.com"\nEmail[["subject"]] = "Test email subject"\nEmail[["htmlbody"]] =\n"&lt;html>Test &lt;k>email&lt;/k> body&lt;/html>"\n\nEmail[["attachments"]]$Add("C:/.../Attachment.png")</code>\nNow, you can send the email:\n<code>outMail$Send()</code>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-9">How to send bulk emails from R?</h3>\nLet’s say your mail list includes many more than ten recipients and you need to send bulk emails from R. \nWe’ll show you how this can be done via Web API (<k>gmailR</k>) and SMTP (<k>mailR</k>).\n<h3 id="emailtopic-10">Bulk emails with gmailR</h3>\nAs an example, we’ll inform recipients of how much they won in the lottery. \n\nFor this, we need:\n\nan enabled API access on your Google account.\nan installed gmailr R package.\na set of R packages for data iteration: <k>readr</k>, <k>dplyr, </k>and <k>purrr </k>(or <k>plyr </k>as an alternative).\na file containing the variable bits (lottery wins), <em>Variables.csv</em>, with the following format:\n<code>lastname,firstname,win_amount,email_address\nSMITH,JOHN,1234,johnsmith@winner.com\n\nLOCKWOOD,JANE,1234,janelockwood24@example.com</code>\nNow, let’s go through the mail steps to create an R script for bulk emails.\n\nLoad the packages and files we need:\n<code>suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gmailr))\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr))\nlibrary(readr) # => if you don’t have it, run: install.packages("readr", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\n\nmy_dat = read_csv("Variables.csv") </code>\n\nCreate a data frame that will insert variables from the file into the email:\n<code>this_hw = "Lottery Winners"\nemail_sender = \'Best Lottery Ever &lt;info@best-lottery-ever.com>\'\n\noptional_bcc = \'Anonymous &lt;bcc@example.com>\'\nbody = "Hi, %s.\nYour lottery win is %s.\nThanks for betting with us!\n\n"\nedat = my_dat %>%\n    mutate(\n        To = sprintf(\'%s &lt;%s>\', firstname, email_address),\n\n        Bcc = optional_bcc,\n        From = email_sender,\n        Subject = sprintf(\'Lottery win for %s\', win_amount),\n        body = sprintf(body, firstname, win_amount)) %>%\n\n    select(To, Bcc, From, Subject, body)\nwrite_csv(edat, "data-frame.csv")</code>\nThe data frame will be saved to <em>data-frame.csv</em>. \nThis will provide an easy-to-read record of the composed emails.\n\nNow, convert each row of the data frame into a MIME object using the <code>gmailr::mime()</code> function. \nAfter that, <code>purrr::pmap()</code> generates the list of MIME objects, one per row of the input data frame:\n<code>emails = edat %>%\n  pmap(mime)\n\nstr(emails, max.level = 2, list.len = 2)</code>\nIf you use <k>plyr</k> (<code>install.packages("plyr")</code>), you can do this, as follows:\n<code>emails = plyr::dlply(edat, ~ To, function(x) mime(\n  To = x$To,\n\n  Bcc = x$Bcc,\n  From = x$From,\n  Subject = x$Subject,\n  body = x$body))</code>\n\nSpecify your JSON credentials file:\n<code>use_secret_file("GmailCredentials.json")</code>\nAnd send emails with <code>purrr::safely()</code>. \nThis will protect your bulk emails from failures in the middle:\n\n<code>safe_send_message = safely(send_message)\nsent_mail = emails %>%\n  map(safe_send_message)\nsaveRDS(sent_mail,\n\n        paste(gsub("//s+", "_", this_hw), "sent-emails.rds", sep = "_"))</code>\nList recipients with <code>TRUE</code> in case of errors:\n<code>errors = sent_mail %>%\n  transpose() %>%\n\n  .$error %>%\n  map_lgl(Negate(is.null))</code>\nTake a look at the full code now:\n<code>suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gmailr))\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr))\nlibrary(readr) # => if you don’t have it, run: install.packages("readr", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")\n\nmy_dat = read_csv("Variables.csv")\nthis_hw = "Lottery Winners"\nemail_sender = \'Best Lottery Ever &lt;info@best-lottery-ever.com>\'\noptional_bcc = \'Anonymous &lt;bcc@example.com>\'\n\nbody = "Hi, %s.\nYour lottery win is %s.\nThanks for betting with us!\n"\n\nedat = my_dat %>%\n    mutate(\n        To = sprintf(\'%s &lt;%s>\', firstname, email_address),\n        Bcc = optional_bcc,\n\n        From = email_sender,\n        Subject = sprintf(\'Lottery win for %s\', win_amount),\n        body =

to send bulk emails with SMTP, make sure to have an appropriate SMTP server and install the mailR package. \n\nOnce again, we’ll need a <em>.csv</em> file that will contain the data frame you want to integrate into the email. \nThe data should be separated by a special character such as a comma, a semicolon, or a tab9. \nFor example:\n<code>lastname; firstname; win_amount; email_address\n\nSMITH; JOHN; 1234; johnsmith@winner.com\nLOCKWOOD; JANE; 1234; janelockwood24@example.com</code>\nWhat you need to do next:\n\nBuild the HTML email body for a given recipient using the <code>message_text</code> function:\n\n<code>message_text = function(x) sprintf(\'Hello %s %s!/nCongratulation to your win./nYour prize is XXX./nBet with the Best Lottery Ever!\', x$firstname, x$lastname)</code>\nLoad the package and read in the mail list:\n<code>library(mailR)\nmail_list = read.csv2("Variables.csv",as.is=TRUE)</code>\n\nValues in the <em>Variables.csv</em> should be separated with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). \nYou can configure settings to read the data frame using the <code>read.table</code> or <code>read.csv</code> functions.\nCreate a file to write the information of each individual row in the <code>mail_list</code> after each email is sent.\n<code>my_file = file("mail.out",open="w")\n\n# … write data here\nclose(my_file)</code>\nPerform the batch emailing to all students in the mail list:\n<code>for (recipient in 1:nrow(mail_list)) {\n\n  body = message_text(mail_list[recipient,])\n  send.mail(from="info@best-lottery-ever.com",\n    to=as.character(mail_list[recipient,]$email_address),\n    subject="Lottery Winners",\n\n    body=body,\n    html=TRUE,\n    authenticate=TRUE,\n    smtp = list(host.name = "smtp.mailtrap.io",\n\n    user.name = "*****", passwd = "*****", ssl = TRUE),\n    encoding = "utf-8",send=TRUE)\n  print(mail_list[recipient,])\n  Sys.sleep(runif(n=1,min=3,max=6))\n\n  #write each recipient to a file\n  result_file = file("mail.out",open="a")\n  writeLines(text=paste0("[",recipient,"] ",\n    paste0(as.character(mail_list[recipient,]),collapse="/t")),\n\n    sep="/n",con=result_file)\n  close(result_file)\n}</code>\nAnd here is the full code:\n\n<code>message_text = function(x) sprintf(\'Hello %s %s!/nCongratulation to your win./nYour prize is XXX./nBet with the Best Lottery Ever!\', x$firstname, x$lastname)\nlibrary(mailR)\nmail_list = read.csv2("Variables.csv",as.is=TRUE)\nmy_file = file("mail.out",open="w")\n\n# … write data here\nclose(my_file)\nfor (recipient in

to test email sending in R with Mailtrap</h3>\nIf you choose to send emails from R via SMTP, then Mailtrap is what you need for testing. \n\nIt’s a universal service with a fake SMTP server underneath. \nThis means, your test emails are not actually being sent. \nThey go from your app or any other mail client to the SMTP server and are trapped there. \nThus, you protect your real recipients from an undesirable experience – they won’t receive any of your test emails. \n\nAll the aforementioned examples with Mailtrap credentials work in this way. \nIf you need to test anything else, just replace your SMTP credentials with those of Mailtrap and that’s it. \nFor this, you need to <a href="https://mailtrap.io/register/signup?ref=header" target="_blank">sign up</a> first using your email, GitHub or Google account. \nA FREE FOREVER plan is available! For more on the features and functions provided by Mailtrap, read the <a href="https://help.mailtrap.io/article/12-getting-started-guide">Getting Started Guide</a>.\n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-13">To wrap up</h3>\nWe’ve listed a number of options for sending emails in R, so choose the one that best fits your requirements. \nFor example, if you need to send hundreds (or even thousands) of emails daily, gmailR may be the best solution. \nOn the other hand, sending via SMTP is a more common and reliable way and R provides a few packages for this. \nSo, good luck with your choice!\n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-14">Sending emails via Gmail API – gmailR</h3>\nGmail is one of the most popular email services so far, and you will very probably want to use it as a mailbox for your web or mobile app. \nIt is safe and credible, which is crucial to <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/avoid-spam-filters/" target="_blank">prevent your emails from going into the spam folder</a>. \nThat’s why we decided to flesh out how to send emails with Gmail API. \n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-15">Gmail API – why you should consider using it</h3>\nThe API provides you with a RESTful access to the features you usually have with Gmail:\n\nSend and receive HTML emails\nSend and receive emails with attachments\nCRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations with messages, drafts, threads, and

Gmail API works and you can send your first email.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-24">Step 7: Create an email</h3>\nTo send a message, first you need to create one. \nFor this, your app can use the <em>drafts.create</em> method which includes:\n\nCreation of a MIME message\nConversion of the message into a base64url encoded string\nCreation of a draft\nLet’s see how this is done in practice with Python:\n<code>def create_message(sender, to, subject, message_text):\n message = MIMEText(message_text)\n message[\'to\'] = to\n message[\'from\'] = sender\n message[\'subject\'] = subject\n

Send an email</h3>\nOnce you have created your message, you can either call <em>messages.send</em> or <em>drafts.send</em> to send it. \nHere is how it may look: \nPython\n<code>def send_message(service, user_id, message):\n try:\n   message = service.users().messages().send(userId=user_id, body=message).execute()\n   print(\'Message Id: %s\' % message[\'id\'])\n   return message\n except Exception as e:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % e)\n   return None</code>\nand PHP\n<code>/**\n* @param $service Google_Service_Gmail an authorized Gmail API service

$userId, $message) {\ntry {\n  $message = $service->users_messages->send($userId, $message);\n  print \'Message with ID: \' . \n$message->getId() . \n\' sent.\';\n  return $message;\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n  print \'An error occurred: \' . \n$e->getMessage();\n}\nreturn null;\n}</code>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-26">Step 8.1: Send an email with attachments</h3>\nYou can also create and send a multi-part MIME message. \nFor example, this is how it looks with Python: \n<code>def send_message(service, user_id, message):\n try:\n   message = service.users().messages().send(userId=user_id, body=message).execute()\n   print(\'Message Id: %s\' % message[\'id\'])\n   return message\n except Exception as e:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % e)\n   return None\ndef create_message_with_attachment(sender, to, subject, message_text, file):\n message = MIMEMultipart()\n message[\'to\'] = to\n message[\'from\'] = sender\n message[\'subject\'] = subject\n msg = MIMEText(message_text)\n message.attach(msg)\n content_type, encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(file)\n if content_type is None or encoding is not None:\n   content_type = \'application/octet-stream\'\n main_type, sub_type = content_type.split(\'/\', 1)\n if main_type == \'text\':\n   fp = open(file, \'rb\')\n   msg = MIMEText(fp.read().decode("utf-8"), _subtype=sub_type)\n   fp.close()\n elif main_type == \'image\':\n   fp = open(file, \'rb\')\n   msg = MIMEImage(fp.read(), _subtype=sub_type)\n   fp.close()\n elif main_type == \'audio\':\n   fp = open(file, \'rb\')\n   msg =

base64.urlsafe_b64encode(message.as_string().encode("utf-8"))\n return {\'raw\': raw_message.decode("utf-8")}</code>\n<k><a href="https://mailtrap.io/register/signup?ref=anchor">Test your emails before they are sent to real users.</a></k>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-27">Step 9: Read a specific email from your inbox</h3>\nIt would be weird if you can’t use the API to read messages from Gmail. \nLuckily you can by using the <em>get</em> method by the message ID. \nHere is how it may look in a Python app: \n<code>import base64\nimport email\ndef get_messages(service, user_id):\n try:\n   return service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id).execute()\n except Exception as error:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % error)\ndef get_message(service, user_id, msg_id):\n try:\n   return service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id, format=\'metadata\').execute()\n except Exception as error:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % error)\ndef get_mime_message(service, user_id, msg_id):\n try:\n   message = service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id,\n                                            format=\'raw\').execute()\n   print(\'Message snippet: %s\' % message[\'snippet\'])\n   msg_str = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(message[\'raw\'].encode("utf-8")).decode("utf-8")\n   mime_msg = email.message_from_string(msg_str)\n   return mime_msg\n except Exception as error:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % error)</code>\nIf the message contains an attachment, expand your code with the following: \n<code>def get_attachments(service, user_id, msg_id, store_dir):\n try:\n   message = service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id).execute()\n   for part in message[\'payload\'][\'parts\']:\n     if(part[\'filename\'] and part[\'body\'] and part[\'body\'][\'attachmentId\']):\n       attachment = service.users().messages().attachments().get(id=part[\'body\'][\'attachmentId\'], userId=user_id, messageId=msg_id).execute()\n       file_data = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(attachment[\'data\'].encode(\'utf-8\'))\n       path = \'\'.join([store_dir, part[\'filename\']])\n       f = open(path, \'wb\')\n       f.write(file_data)\n       f.close()\n except Exception as error:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % error)</code>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-28">Why is Gmail API better or worse than traditional SMTP?&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-29">Email protocol used</h3>\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a set of rules for sending emails either from the sender to the email server or between servers. \nMost email service providers use SMTP to send and POP3/IMAP4 to receive emails. \nTo learn more about these protocols, you can read our <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/imap-pop3-smtp/" target="_blank">IMAP vs. \nPOP3 vs. \nSMTP</a> blog post. \nGoogle also provides the Gmail SMTP server as a free SMTP service. \nApplication Programming Interface (API) is an interaction channel used by apps, platforms, and codes to reach each other. \nWith Gmail API, you can send emails using only HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. \n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-30">How are emails sent?</h3>\nYou can call the API from the app to communicate with an email service that is used to send emails from another server.&nbsp;\nFor SMTP, a client establishes a TCP connection to the SMTP server and transfers an email. \nAfter authorization, the server sends the email to the recipient’s SMTP server, which, in turn, forwards it to the IMAP4 or POP3 server. \nClient and server communicate with each other using <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp-commands-and-responses/" target="_blank">SMTP commands and responses</a>.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-31">Authentication</h3>\nGmail API uses open authentication (Oauth3), which only lets you request the scope of access you need. \nSMTP provides full access to the account using client login and password <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp-auth/" target="_blank">SMTP authentication</a>.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-32">Quota</h3>\nThe usage limit of Gmail API is one billion quota units per day. \nEach method requires a particular number of quota units. \nFor example, a <code>drafts.create</code> is 10 units and a <code>messages.send</code> is 100 units. \nGmail API enforces standard daily <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852" target="_blank">mail sending limits</a>. \nAlso, keep in mind that the <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/email-size/" target="_blank" aria-label="maximum email size in Gmail (opens in a new tab)">maximum email size in Gmail</a> is 25MB.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-33">SMTP or API?</h3>\nEach option has its own pros and cons. \nSMTP is a widely adopted and easy-to-set-up solution to send emails. \nMoreover, you don’t need any coding skills to handle stuff. \nAlso, you can benefit from using a fake SMTP server such as <a href="https://mailtrap.io">Mailtrap</a> as a playground for safe email testing.\nBesides, it is a great option to automate processes and provide a wide range of functionality for the app. \nAlso, API can boast an extra level of security, which is crucial if you deal with sending sensitive data in emails. \n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-34"><span class="orange">Send Emails with Gmail API</span></h3>\nGmail is one of the most popular email services so far, and you will very probably want to use it as a mailbox for your web or mobile app. \nIt is safe and credible, which is crucial to <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/avoid-spam-filters/" target="_blank">prevent your emails from going into the spam folder</a>. \nThat’s why we decided to flesh out how to send emails with Gmail API. \n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-35">Gmail API – why you should consider using it</h3>\nThe API provides you with a RESTful access to the features you usually have with Gmail:\n\nSend and receive HTML emails\nSend and receive emails with attachments\nCRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations with messages, drafts, threads, and labels&nbsp;\nAccess control of your Gmail inbox\nFull search capabilities of the web UI\nPerform specific queries&nbsp;\nAnd many more…\nDevelopers love Gmail API because it’s easy to implement. \nWe’ll talk about that a bit later. \nAlso, you can use this option for versatile cases like: \n\nautomated email sending\nmail backup\nmail migration from other email services\n<h3 id="emailtopic-36">Resource types and methods</h3>\nWith Gmail API, you can deal with several resource types and manage them using the following methods:\n<table><tbody><tr><th width="30%">Resource type</th><th width="70%">Method</th></tr><tr><td><k>Draft</k>\nan unsent message that you can modify once created</td><td>\ncreate (creating a new draft)\n\ndelete (removing the specified

Gmail API works and you can send your first email.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-44">Step 7: Create an email</h3>\nTo send a message, first you need to create one. \nFor this, your app can use the <em>drafts.create</em> method which includes:\n\nCreation of a MIME message\nConversion of the message into a base64url encoded string\nCreation of a draft\nLet’s see how this is done in practice with Python:\n<code>def create_message(sender, to, subject, message_text):\n message = MIMEText(message_text)\n message[\'to\'] = to\n message[\'from\'] = sender\n message[\'subject\'] = subject\n

before they are sent to real users.</a></k>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-47">Step 9: Read a specific email from your inbox</h3>\nIt would be weird if you can’t use the API to read messages from Gmail. \nLuckily you can by using the <em>get</em> method by the message ID. \nHere is how it may look in a Python app: \n<code>import base64\nimport email\ndef get_messages(service, user_id):\n try:\n   return service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id).execute()\n except Exception as error:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % error)\ndef get_message(service, user_id, msg_id):\n try:\n   return

Exception as error:\n   print(\'An error occurred: %s\' % error)</code>\nIf the message contains an attachment, expand your code with the following: \n<code>def get_attachments(service, user_id, msg_id, store_dir):\n try:\n   message = service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id).execute()\n   for part in message[\'payload\'][\'parts\']:\n     if(part[\'filename\'] and

traditional SMTP?&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3 id="emailtopic-49">Email protocol used</h3>\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a set of rules for sending emails either from the sender to the email server or between servers. \nMost email service providers use SMTP to send and POP3/IMAP4 to receive emails. \nTo learn more about these protocols, you can read our <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/imap-pop3-smtp/" target="_blank">IMAP vs. \nPOP3 vs. \nSMTP</a> blog post. \nGoogle also provides the Gmail SMTP server as a free SMTP service. \nApplication Programming Interface (API) is an interaction channel used by apps, platforms, and codes to reach each other. \nWith Gmail API, you can send emails using only HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. \n\n<h3 id="emailtopic-50">How are emails sent?</h3>\nYou can call the API from the app to communicate with an email service that is used to send emails from another server.&nbsp;\nFor SMTP, a client establishes a TCP connection to the SMTP server and transfers an email. \nAfter authorization, the server sends the email to the recipient’s SMTP server, which, in turn, forwards it to the IMAP4 or POP3 server. \nClient and server communicate with each other using <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp-commands-and-responses/" target="_blank">SMTP commands and responses</a>.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-51">Authentication</h3>\nGmail API uses open authentication (Oauth3), which only lets you request the scope of access you need. \nSMTP provides full access to the account using client login and password <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp-auth/" target="_blank">SMTP authentication</a>.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-52">Quota</h3>\nThe usage limit of Gmail API is one billion quota units per day. \nEach method requires a particular number of quota units. \nFor example, a <code>drafts.create</code> is 10 units and a <code>messages.send</code> is 100 units. \nGmail API enforces standard daily <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852" target="_blank">mail sending limits</a>. \nAlso, keep in mind that the <a href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/email-size/" target="_blank" aria-label="maximum email size in Gmail (opens in a new tab)">maximum email size in Gmail</a> is 25MB.\n<h3 id="emailtopic-53">SMTP or API?</h3>\nEach option has its own pros and cons. \nSMTP is a widely adopted and easy-to-set-up solution to send emails. \nMoreover, you don’t need any coding skills to

'<h2>Executing R from Python and Vice Versa</h2>\nCommand Line Execution and Executing Subprocesses\nTo better understand what’s happening when a subprocess is executed, it is worth revisiting in more detail what happens when a Python or R process is executed on the command line. When the following command is run, a new Python process is started to execute the script.\n\npython path/to/myscript.py arg1 arg2 arg3\n\nDuring executing, any outputs that are printed to the standard output and standard error streams are displayed back to the console. The most common way this is achieved is via a built in function (print() in Python and cat() or print() in R), which writes a given string to the stdout stream. The Python process is then closed once the script has finished executing.\n\nRunning command line scripts in this fashion is useful, but can become tedious and error prone if there are a number of sequential but separate scripts that you wish to execute this way. However it is possible for a Python or R process to execute another directly in a similar way to the above command line approach. This is beneficial as it allows, say a parent Python process to fire up a child R process to run a specific script for the analysis. The outputs of this child R process can then be passed back to the parent Python process once the R script is complete, instead of being printed to the console. Using this approach removes the need to manually execute steps individually on the command line.\n\nExamples\nTo illustrate the execution of one process by another we are going to use two simple examples: one where Python calls R, and one where R calls Python. The analysis performed in each case is trivial on purpose so as to focus on the machinery around how this is achieved.\n\nSample R Script\nOur simple example R script is going to take in a sequence of numbers from the command line and return the maximum.\n\n# max.R\n\n# Fetch command line arguments\nmyArgs <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)\n\n# Convert to numerics\nnums = as.numeric(myArgs)\n\n# cat will write the result to the stdout stream\ncat(max(nums))\n\nExecuting an R Script from Python\nTo execute this from Python we make use of the subprocess module, which is part of the standard library. We will be using the function, check_output to call the R script, which executes a command and stores the output of stdout.\n\nTo execute the max.R script in R from Python, you first have to build up the command to be executed. This takes a similar format to the command line statement we saw in part I of this blog post series, and in Python terms is represented as a list of strings, whose elements correspond to the following:\n\n[\'<command_to_run>\', \'<path_to_script>\', \'arg1\' , \'arg2\', \'arg3\', \'arg4\']\n\nAn example of executing an R script form Python is given in the following code.\n\n# run_max.py\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define command and arguments\ncommand =\'Rscript\'\npath2script =\'path/to your script/max.R\'\n\n# Variable number of args in a list\nargs = [\'11\',\'3\',\'9\',\'42\']\n\n# Build subprocess command\ncmd = [command, path2script] + args\n\n# check_output will run the command and store to result\nx = subprocess.check_output(cmd, universal_newlines=True)\n\nprint(\'The maximum of the numbers is:\', x)\n\nThe argument universal_newlines=True tells Python to interpret the returned output as a text string and handle both Windows and Linux newline characters. If it is omitted, the output is returned as a byte string and must be decoded to text by calling x.decode() before any further string manipulation can be performed.\n\nSample Python Script\nFor our simple Python script, we will split a given string (first argument) into multiple substrings based on a supplied substring pattern (second argument). The result is then printed to the console one substring per line.\n\n# splitstr.py\nimport sys\n\n# Get the arguments passed in\nstring = sys.argv[1]\npattern = sys.argv[2]\n\n# Perform the splitting\nans = string.split(pattern)\n\n# Join the resulting list of elements into a single newline\n# delimited string and print\nprint(\'/n\'.join(ans))\n\nExecuting a Python Script from R\nWhen executing subprocess with R, it is recommended to use R’s system2 function to execute and capture the output. This is because the inbuilt system function is trickier to use and is not cross-platform compatible.\n\nBuilding up the command to be executed is similar to the above Python example, however system2 expects the command to be parsed separately from its arguments. In addition the first of these arguments must always be the path to the script being executed.\n\nOne final complication can arise from dealing with spaces in the path name to the R script. The simplest method to solve this issue is to double quote the whole path name and then encapsulate this string with single quotes so that R preserves the double quotes in the argument itself.\n\nAn example of executing a Python script from R is given in the following code.\n\n# run_splitstr.R\n\ncommand ="python“\n\n# Note the single + double quotes in the string (needed if paths have spaces)\npath2script=\'"path/to your script/splitstr.py"\'\n\n# Build up args in a vector\nstring ="3523462---12413415---4577678---7967956---5456439"\npattern ="---"\nargs = c(string, pattern)\n\n# Add path to script as first arg\nallArgs = c(path2script, args)\n\noutput = system2(command, args=allArgs, stdout=TRUE)\n\nprint(paste("The Substrings are:/n", output))\n\nTo capture the standard output in a character vector (one line per element), stdout=TRUE must be specified in system2, else just the exit status is returned. When stdout=TRUE the exit status is stored in an attribute called “status”.\n\nSummary\nIt is possible to integrate Python and R into a single application via the use of subprocess calls. These allow one parent process to call another as a child process, and capture any output that is printed to stdout. In this post we have gone through examples of using this approach to get an R script to call Python and vice versa.\n\nIn a future upcoming article will draw on the material of this post and part I, to show a real world example of using Python and R together in an application.\n',

'<h2>The .C function interface</h2>\nInside a running R session, the .C interface allows objects to be directly accessed in an R session\'s active memory. \nThus, to write a compatible C function, <em>all arguments must be pointers</em>. \nNo matter the nature of your function\'s return value, it too must be handled using pointers. \nThe C function you will write is effectively a subroutine. \nOur function f(<em>x</em>)= 2<em>x</em>, implemented as double_me in the file doubler.c, is shown below. \nvoid double_me(int* x) {\n // Doubles the value at the memory location pointed to by x\n *x = *x + *x;\n}\n To compile the C code, run the following line at your terminal:\n$ R CMD SHLIB doubler.c \nIn an R interactive session, run:\ndyn.load(&quot;doubler.so&quot;)\n.C(&quot;double_me&quot;, x = as.integer(5))\n$x\n[1] 10\nNotice that the output of .C is a list with names corresponding to the arguments. \nWhile the above code is pure C, adding C++ code (instead of C) is made possible by using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Interfacing-C_002b_002b-code">extern wrapper</a>. \n',
'<h2>.Call interface</h2>\nThe .Call interface is the more fully featured and complex cousin of the .C interface. \nUnlike .C, .Call requires header files that come standard with every R installation. \nThese header files provide access to a new data type, SEXP. \nThe following code, stored in the file, doubler2.c, illustrates its use. \n#include &lt;R.h>\n#include &lt;Rdefines.h>\nSEXP double_me2(SEXP x) {\n // Doubles the value of the first integer element of the SEXP input\n SEXP result;\n PROTECT(result = NEW_INTEGER(1)); // i.e., a scalar quantity\n INTEGER(result)[0] = INTEGER(x)[0] * 2;\n UNPROTECT(1); // Release the one item that was protected\n return result;\n}\nUnlike our experience with the .C interface, double_me2 is a function and  does return a value. \nWhile that appeals to intuition, no matter what the native input and output types, they must now live in a SEXP object. \nTo code double_me2, you must know that there\'s an integer in the input x, and extract it as if it were the first item in a C array. \nFor the return value, you must add your integer result to a SEXP object in an equally unnatural way. \nThe PROTECT function must be used to prevent R\'s automatic garbage collection from destroying all the objects. \n\nAs before, use R at the command line to compile doubler2.c:\n$ R CMD SHLIB doubler2.c \n Back in the R interactive console, the steps are very similar. \ndyn.load(&quot;doubler2.so&quot;)\n.Call(&quot;double_me2&quot;, as.integer(5))\n\n[1] 10\nNotice now that the output is an integer vector instead of a list. \n ',
'<h2>Rcpp and the sourceCpp function</h2>\nThe .C and .Call examples above owe a debt to Jonathan Callahan\'s entries <a href="http://mazamascience.com/WorkingWithData/?p=1067">8</a> and <a href="http://mazamascience.com/WorkingWithData/?p=1099">10</a> of his <a href = "http://mazamascience.com/WorkingWithData/?series=using-r">Using R</a> series. \nWhen the examples started working, I tweeted to share my excitement.\nLet\'s check it out. \n \nIn terms of the code alone, it\'s easy to see where Hadley is coming from. \nIt\'s readable, looks just like standard C++ code, and features data types that make intuitive sense. \nOur simple function is implemented below, saved in the final static file doubler3.cpp (though, in all humility, it\'s really just C). \n#include &lt;Rcpp.h>\nusing namespace Rcpp;\n// [[Rcpp::export]]\nint double_me3(int x) {\n // takes a numeric input and doubles it\n return 2 * x;\n}\nI\'ll refer you to Hadley\'s article <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html">High performance functions with Rcpp</a> for details on Rcpp, but for now, note the &#8220;// [[Rcpp::export]]&#8221; comment, necessary before each C/C++ function, and the updated #include statement. \nMost importantly, notice how the pointers and SEXP objects have been replaced. \nJust like our original function f(<em>x</em>), double_me3 takes one integer input and returns one integer output. \n \nAfter installing the Rcpp package, we\'re back to the console one final time. \nlibrary(Rcpp)\nsourceCpp(&quot;doubler3.cpp&quot;)\ndouble_me3(5)\n\n[1] 10\nWith Rcpp, the function is waiting for us in the global environment, without even compiling at the command line. \nPretty convenient!  \n',
'<h2>run Python in R</h2>\nIn addition to reticulate, you need Python installed on your system. \nYou also need any Python modules, packages, and files your Python code depends on.\n\nIf you\'d like to follow along, install and load reticulate with <code>install.packages("reticulate")</code> and <code>library(reticulate)</code>.\n\nTo keep things simple, let\'s start with just two lines of Python code to import the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="NumPy">NumPy package</a> for basic scientific computing and create an array of four numbers. \nThe Python code looks like this:\nimport numpy as np\nmy_python_array = np.array([2,4,6,8])\n\nAnd here’s one way to do that right in an R script:\n\npy_run_string("import numpy as np")\npy_run_string("my_python_array = np.array([2,4,6,8])")\n\nThe <code>py_run_string()</code> function executes whatever Python code is within the parentheses and quotation marks. \n\nIf you run that code in R, it may look like nothing happened. \nNothing shows up in your RStudio environment pane, and no value is returned. \nIf you run <code>print(my_python_array)</code> in R, you get an error that <code>my_python_array</code> doesn\'t exist.\n\nBut if you run a <em>Python</em> print command inside the <code>py_run_string()</code> function such as \npy_run_string("for item in my_python_array: print(item)")\n\nyou should see a result. \n\nIt’s going to get annoying running Python code line by line like this, though, if you have more than a couple of lines of code. \nSo there are a few other ways to run Python in R and reticulate.\n\nOne is to put all the Python code in a regular .py file, and use the <code>py_run_file()</code> function. \nAnother way I like is to use an R Markdown document. \n\nR Markdown lets you combine text, code, code results, and visualizations in a single document. \nR Markdown lets you combine text, code, code results, and visualizations in a single document. \nYou can create a new R Markdown document in RStudio by choosing File > New File > R Markdown.\n\nCode chunks start with three backticks (<code>```</code>) and end with three backticks, and they have a gray background by default in RStudio.\n\nThis first chunk is for R code—you can see that with the <code>r</code> after the opening bracket. \nIt loads the reticulate package and then you specify the version of Python you want to use. \n(If you don’t specify, it’ll use your system default.)\n```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\nlibrary(reticulate)\nuse_python("/usr/bin/python")\n```\n\nThis second chunk below is for Python code. \nYou can type the Python like you would in a Python file. \nThe code below imports NumPy, creates an array, and prints the array.\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nmy_python_array = np.array([2,4,6,8])\nfor item in my_python_array:\n    print(item)\n```\n\nHere’s the cool part: You can use that array in R by referring to it as <code>py$my_python_array</code> (in general, <code>py$objectname</code>).\n\nIn this next code chunk, I store that Python array in an R variable called <code>my_r_array</code>. \nAnd then I check the class of that array.\n```{r}\nmy_r_array = py$my_python_array\nclass(my_r_array)\n\nIt’s a class “array,” which isn’t exactly what you’d expect for an R object like this. \nBut I can turn it into a regular vector with <code>as.vector(my_r_array)</code> and run whatever R operations I’d like on it, such as  multiplying each item by 2. \n\n```{r}\nmy_r_vector = as.vector(py$my_python_array)\nclass(my_r_vector)\nmy_r_vector = my_r_vector * 2\n```\n\nNext cool part: I can use that R variable back in Python, as <code>r.my_r_array</code> (more generally, <code>r.variablename</code>), such as \n```{python}\nmy_python_array2 = r.my_r_vector\nprint(my_python_array2)\n```\n',

'<h2>Integration between R and php</h2>\nThere are several options, but one option is to use RApache. \nInstall RApache as indicated in http://rapache.net/manual.html\n\nSet the Apache directive in httpd.conf which will make sure all files under /var/www/brew are parsed as R scripts\n\n&lt;Directory /var/www/brew>\n  SetHandler r-script\n  RHandler brew::brew\n&lt;/Directory>\n\nMake your R script with your API with file name plot.R and put it under the /var/www/brew folder. \n\nThis R script file can e.g. look as follows:\n<%\nlibrary(rjson)\nargs <- GET\ntmp <- lapply(args, FUN=function(x) strsplit(x, " "))\ntypeOfData <- tmp[[1]][1]\nmonth <- tmp[[2]][1]\nyear <- tmp[[3]][1]\noutput <- list(imgname="imgs/tmax.tiff")\ncat(toJSON(output))\n%>\n\nMark the GET\n\nNow you can call your API from PHP as you would call any other webservice by calling http://localhost/brew/plot.R?typeOfData=1&month=2&year=2014. \nReplace localhost with the IP of the server where you are hosting the API.\n\nWhen using RApache, each time you get GET, POST, COOKIES, FILES, SERVER variables which were passed on to the API call. \nSo if you want to use POST in your call instead of the GET example, go ahead. \nSee the documentation in http://rapache.net/manual.html for these variables.\n\nCheck out <a href="https://github.com/cturbelin/rserve-php" class="whitebut ">Rserve-php</a>. \nIt uses Rserve as a backend which is a TCP/IP server for R.\n\nHave a look at <a href="https://github.com/kachkaev/php-r" class="whitebut ">php-r</a> library on github, it lets you execute R code from PHP (having R interpreter installed on your machine).\n',
'<h2>How to Integrate R with PHP</h2>\nThis tutorial explains how to integrate R with PHP.\n\nOnline reporting tools have gained popularity in recent years. \nThere is a growing demand to implement advanced analytics in these tools. \nUse of advanced analytics help to solve various organization problems such as retaining existing customers or acquiring new customers, increasing customer satisfaction etc.\n\nPHP is one of the most popular programming language to develop websites and online reporting tools. \nIt has rich functionality to write business logic, however they are not effective when it comes to data science and machine learning. \nIn the field of data science, R dominates in terms of popularity among statisticians and data scientists with over 10k number of packages.\n\n<b>How to make PHP communicate with R</b>\nThere are times when you want to showcase the output of R program like charts that you create based on the user inputted data from a web page. \nIn that case you might want your PHP based web application to communicate with the R script.\n\n<b>When it comes to PHP, it has a very useful function called</b> <b>exec().</b> \nIt lets you execute the outside program you provide as the source. \nWe will be using the very same function to execute the R script you created. \nThe then generates the graph and we will show the graph in our web page.\n\nThe <b>exec function</b> can be used on both the Linux and Windows environments.\nOn the Linux environment it will open the terminal window to execute the command you set and arguments you specify. \n\nWhile on the Windows environment it will open the CMD to execute the command you provide along with the arguments you specify.\n\nI will walk you through the process of integrating the R code with PHP web page with code and explanation.&#8195;\n\n<b>Let\'s first create a PHP based web form:</b>\n\n<b>index.php:</b>\n<blockquote>\n&lt;html>\n  &lt;head>\n    &lt;title>PHP and R Integration Sample&lt;/title>\n  &lt;/head>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;div id=&#8221;r-output&#8221; id=&#8221;width: 100%; padding: 25px;&#8221;>\n    &lt;?php\n      // Execute the R script within PHP code\n      // Generates output as test.png image.\n      exec("sample.R");\n    ?>\n    &lt;img class="lazy" data-src=&#8221;test.png?var1.1&#8221; alt=&#8221;R Graph&#8221; />\n    &lt;/div>\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></blockquote>\nNow save the file as index.php under your <b>/htdocs/PROJECT-NAME/index.php.</b>\n\n<b>Let\'s create a sample chart using R code.</b>\nWrite the following code and save it as <b>sample.R file</b>.\n<blockquote>\nx = rnorm(6,0,1)\npng(filename="test.png", width=500, height=500)\nhist(x, col="red")\ndev.off()</blockquote>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-35PXxfvHn5o/WOpvdiPrIgI/AAAAAAAAGHA/AQndI2BK3ZEQJjT2ccfsX8z8ConCuelvACLcB/s1600/Histogram.png">\nHistogram\n<b>rnorm(6, 0 ,1)</b> means generating 6 random values with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. \nThe dev.off() command is used to close the graph. \nOnce chart created it will save it as the test.png file.\n<blockquote>\nThe only downside of this code is that it will create the same test.png file for all the incoming requests. \nMeaning if you are creating charts based on user specified inputs, there will always be one test.png file created for various purpose.</blockquote>\n<b>Let\'s understand the code</b>\nAs specified earlier the exec(\'<b>sample.R\'</b>); will execute the R script. \nIt in turn generates the test.png graph image.\n\nIn the very next line we used the HTML &lt;img /> tag to display the R program generated image on the page. \nWe used the src=test.png?ver1.1 where ver1.1 is used to invalidate the browser cache and download the new image from server.\n\nAll modern browsers supports the browser caching. \nYou might have experienced some website loads way faster on your repetitive visits. \nIt\'s due to the fact that browsers cache the image and other static resources for brief period of time.\n\n<b>How to serve concurrent requests?</b>\n\n<b>sample2.R</b>\n<blockquote>\nargs = commandArgs(TRUE)\ncols = args[1]\nfname = args[2]\nx = rnorm(cols,0,1)\nfname = paste(fname, "png", sep = ".")\npng(filename=fname, width=500, height=500)\nhist(x, col="red") dev.off()</blockquote>\n<b>Index.php</b>\n<blockquote>\n&lt;html>\n  &lt;head>\n    &lt;title>PHP and R Integration Sample&lt;/title>\n  &lt;/head>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;div id=&#8221;r-output&#8221; id=&#8221;width: 100%; padding: 25px;&#8221;>\n    &lt;?php\n      // Execute the R script within PHP code\n      // Generates output as test.png image.\n      $filename = &#8220;samplefile&#8221;.rand(1,100);\n      exec("sample2.R 6 &#8220;.$filename.");\n    ?>\n    &lt;img class="lazy" data-src=&#8221;.$filename.&#8221;.png?var1.1&#8221; alt=&#8221;R Graph&#8221; />\n    &lt;/div>\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></blockquote>\nIt will help you eliminate the need to using the same test.png file name. \nI have used the $filename=&#8221;samplefile&#8221;. \nYou can use any random sequence as I have used in the end of the samplefile name. \nrand(min, max) will help you generate a random number.\n\nIt will help you fix the file overwriting issue. \nAnd you will be able to handle the concurrent requests and server each with unique set of image(s).\n\nYou might need to take care of old file removals. \nIf you are on a linux machine you can setup a cron job which will find and delete the chart image files those are older than 24 hours.\n\n<b>Here is the code to find and remove files:</b>\n\n<b>Delete.php</b>\n<blockquote>\n&lt;?php\n// set the path to your chart image directory\n$dir = "images/temp/";\n// loop through all the chart png files inside the directory.\nforeach (glob($dir."*.png") as $file) {\n// if file is 24 hours old then delete it\nif (filemtime($file) &lt; time() - 86400) {\n    unlink($file);\n    }\n}\n?></blockquote>\n<b>Conclusion</b>\nMaking PHP communicate with R and showcase the result is very simple. \nYou might need to understand the exec() function and some PHP code if in-case you want to delete those residual files/images generated by your R program.\n',
'<h2>PHP 呼叫 R 整合教學，線上資料分析與繪圖工具開發</h2>\n如果您想要開發一個線上分析資料的工具，網頁部份可以使用 PHP、HTML、JavaScript 與 CSS 等傳統技術來處理，而資料的統計分析與繪圖則可以借重 R 語言來解決，以下是常見的幾種 PHP 與 R 語言的整合方式與範例程式碼。\n\n<h3>PHP 執行外部 R 指令稿</h3>\n建立一個 PHP 指令稿，將其命名為 <code>r.php</code>，內容如下：\n&lt;html>\n&lt;body>\n&lt;form action=\'r.php\' method=\'get\'>\n輸入 N 值: &lt;input type=\'text\' name=\'n\' />\n&lt;input type=\'submit\' />\n&lt;/form>\n&lt;?php\nif(isset($_GET[\'n\'])) {\n  $n = $_GET[\'n\'];\n  // 以外部指令的方式呼叫 R 進行繪圖\n  exec("Rscript script.R $n");\n  // 產生亂數\n  $nocache = rand();\n  // 輸出圖檔\n  echo("&lt;img class="lazy" data-src=\'output/hist.png?$nocache\' />");\n}\n?>\n&lt;/body>&lt;/html>\n\n上面這段程式碼的上半部是一個普通的 HTML form，可以用來送出使用者所輸入的參數，而下半部則是 PHP 的程式碼，在接收使用者輸入的 <code>n</code> 值之後，透過 PHP 的 <code>exec</code> 執行外部程式，而 <code>Rscript</code> 這個程式則是附屬在 R 中的一個程式，只要安裝好 R 之後系統上就會有這個程式，它是專門用來執行 R 指令稿的工具程式。\n\n最後在執行完 R 指令稿之後，要顯示繪圖的結果，由於我們每一次所繪製的圖檔檔名都一樣，所以需要在圖檔後方加上一串亂數，強迫讓瀏覽器重新抓取新的圖檔（也就是不要使用瀏覽器的快取），這樣每次送出新的 <code>n</code> 值才會顯示新的結果。\n\n以下是 <code>script.R</code> 這一個 R 指令稿的內容：\nargs = commandArgs(TRUE)\n# 取得使用者輸入的 N 值\nn = args[1]\n# 產生資料\nx = rnorm(n, 0, 1)\n# 繪製直方圖\npng(filename="output/hist.png", width = 500, height = 300)\nhist(x, col = "orange")\ndev.off()\n\n在 R 中我們透過 <code>commandArgs</code> 取得從 shell 中傳入的參數，其中第一個參數就是使用者輸入的 <code>n</code> 值，藉由這樣的方式就可以取得從 PHP 傳過來的資料。\n接著產生一些常態分佈的亂數資料，並繪製一張直方圖，我們將圖形儲存至 <code>output</code> 這個目錄中，然後再讓網頁直接讀取這個圖檔，這樣就可以將結果傳給使用者。\n\n這裡我是規劃 <code>output</code> 目錄專門用來放置輸出的圖檔，由於 R 的指令稿會以執行網頁伺服器的使用者（在 Ubuntu Linux 中通常是 <code>www-data</code>）權限來執行，所以請注意目錄權限的設定，要讓伺服器有權限可以寫入這個目錄。\n\n執行的結果會像這樣：\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://blog.gtwang.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/integrating-php-and-r-20161101-1.png">\n\nPHP 呼叫 R 的網頁\n<h3>PHP 開啟管線執行 R 指令稿</h3>\n以 PHP 的 <code>exec</code> 執行外部的 R 指令稿是一個比較簡單的方式，不過缺點就是它需要另外建立一個單獨的 R 指令稿，如果不想要另外建立一個 R 檔案，可以改用 <code>proc_open</code> 的方式，直接把 R 的指令從 PHP 中透過 Linux 的管線（pipe）寫到 R 的行程（process）中，這樣就可以省去建立 R 檔案的麻煩，以下是一個簡單的範例：\n&lt;html>&lt;body>\n&lt;form action=\'r.php\' method=\'get\'>\n輸入 N 值: &lt;input type=\'text\' name=\'n\' />\n&lt;input type=\'submit\' />\n&lt;/form>\n&lt;?php\nif(isset($_GET[\'n\'])) {\n  $n = $_GET[\'n\'];\n\n  $descriptorspec = array(\n    0 => array(&quot;pipe&quot;, &quot;r&quot;),             // stdin\n    1 => array(&quot;file&quot;, &quot;/tmp/output.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;),// stdout\n    2 => array(&quot;file&quot;, &quot;/tmp/error.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) // stderr\n  );\n\n  // 以管線的方式執行 R 指令稿進行繪圖\n  $rproc = proc_open(&quot;R --vanilla&quot;, $descriptorspec, $pipes);\n\n  if (is_resource($rproc)) {\n\n    fwrite($pipes[0], &quot;x = rnorm($n, 0, 1);&quot;);\n    fwrite($pipes[0], &quot;png(filename=\'output/hist.png\', width = 500, height = 300);&quot;);\n    fwrite($pipes[0], &quot;hist(x, col = \'orange\');&quot;);\n    fwrite($pipes[0], &quot;dev.off();&quot;);\n\n    fclose($pipes[0]);\n\n    proc_close($rproc);\n\n    // 產生亂數\n    $nocache = rand();\n\n    // 輸出圖檔\n    echo(&quot;&lt;img class="lazy" data-src=\'output/hist.png?$nocache\' />&quot;);\n  }\n}\n?>\n&lt;/body>&lt;/html>\n\n這個範例我們利用 <code>proc_open</code> 從 PHP 中開啟一個 R 的行程，在開啟新的行程之前，要先以 <code>$descriptorspec</code> 設定好新行程的標準輸入、標準輸出與標準錯誤，此處我們將新 R 行程的標準輸入指定為管線，方便我們直接從 PHP 寫入資料，而 R 的輸出與錯訊息則是導入兩個暫存檔中，通常在開發階段這樣可以方便我們檢視程式是否有正確執行，除錯也比較方便。\n\n將 R 的指令都寫入 R 的行程之後，在呼叫 <code>proc_close</code> 關閉 R 行程之前，要記得先將所有的管線關閉，避免造成 deadlock。\n最後一樣照舊將圖檔顯示在網頁上，不管是使用 <code>proc_close</code> 還是 <code>exec</code> 來整合 PHP 與 R，顯示出來的效果看起來都相同，只有內部的程式結構上有些差異而已。',

'<h2>23 RStudio Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts</h2>\nPublished: June 10, 2020\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rstudio-tips-tricks-shortcuts-1.png">RStudio is an open-source tool for programming in R. \nIf you are interested in programming with R, it’s worth knowing about the capabilities of RStudio. \nIt is a flexible tool that helps you create readable analyses, and keeps your code, images, comments, and plots together in one place.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll cover some of the best features from the free version of RStudio: <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" style="outline: none;">RStudio Desktop</a>. \nWe’ve collected some of the top RStudio tips, tricks, and shortcuts to quickly turn you into an RStudio power user!\n\n> install.packages("Dataquest")\nStart learning R today with our <a href="/course/intro-to-r/">Introduction to R course</a> — no credit card required!\n<a class="btn btn-success" href="https://app.dataquest.io/signup">SIGN UP</a>\n\n<h3>1. Navigate Quickly Between Window Panes</h3>\nRStudio window panes keep important information about your project accessible. \nKnowing how to toggle between panes without touching your mouse to move your cursor will save time and improve your workflow. \nUse these shortcuts to instantly move between panes:\n\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 1</code>: Source editor (your script)\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 2</code>: Console\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 3</code>: Help\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 4</code>: History\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 5</code>: Files\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 6</code>: Plots\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 7</code>: Packages\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 8</code>: Environment\n<code>Control/Ctrl + 9</code>: Viewer\n\nIf you prefer to only have one pane in view at a time, add <code>Shift</code> to any of the above commands to maximize the pane. \nFor example, enter <code>Control/Ctrl + Shift + 1</code> to maximize the R script, notebook, or R Markdown file you are working in.\n\n(Side note: The <code>+</code> we show in the shortcuts means “and”, so there’s no need to actually type the <code>+</code> key.)\n\nBut what if you want to return to the standard four-pane view? No problem! Enter <code>Control/Ctrl + Shift + 0</code>:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/panes.png">\n\n<h3>2. Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>\nKnowing RStudio keyboard shortcuts will save lots of time when programming. \nRStudio provides dozens of useful shortcuts that you can access through the menu at the top: <code>Tools > Keyboard Shortcuts Help</code>.\n\nAnother way to access RStudio keyboard shortcuts is with a shortcut! To access shortcuts, type <code>Option + Shift + K</code> on a Mac, or <code>Alt + Shift + K</code> on Linux and Windows.\n\nHere are some of our favorite RStudio shortcuts:\n\nInsert the = assignment operator with <code>Option + -</code> on a Mac, or <code>Alt + -</code> on Linux and Windows.\nInsert the pipe operator <code>%>%</code> with <code>Command + Shift + M</code> on a Mac, or <code>Ctrl + Shift + M</code> on Linux and Windows.\nRun the current line of code with <code>Command + Enter</code> on a Mac or <code>Control + Enter</code> on Linux and Windows.\nRun all lines of code with <code>Command + A + Enter</code> on a Mac or <code>Control + A + Enter</code> on Linux and Windows.\nRestart the current R session and start fresh with <code>Command + Shift + F10</code> on a Mac or <code>Control + Shift + F10</code> on Linux and Windows.\nComment or uncomment lines with <code>Command + Shift + C</code> on a Mac or <code>Control + Shift + C</code> on Linux and Windows.\nTrying to remember a command you submitted earlier? Search the command history from the Console with <code>Command + [up arrow]</code> on a Mac or <code>Control + [up arrow]</code> on Linux and Windows.\n\nThere are many more useful shortcuts available, but by mastering the shortcuts above, you’ll be on your way to becoming an RStudio power user!\n\nAnother great resource for RStudio shortcuts is the official RStudio cheat sheet available <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">here</a>.\n\n<h3>3. Save Time with Code Completion</h3>\nAfter you begin typing, a suggestion window will pop up with matching names of functions, objects, and snippets. \nYou can toggle through the list using the up or down arrows and hit <code>return/Enter</code> to make your selection.\n\nAlternatively, you can utilize a very cool feature called <k>fuzzy matching,</k> which allows you to narrow your search options by entering letters unique to the item you are matching. \nYou do not need to enter all of the letters as long as your entry matches the order of the string.\n\nLet’s take a look at how these code completion methods work. \nFirst, we’ll select the <code>installed.packages()</code> function by typing part of the function name, and then use arrows to make the selection. \nNext, we’ll use fuzzy matching to only enter <code>instd</code> to narrow our selection further:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/code_completion.gif">\n\n<h3>4. Quickly Find Files and Functions</h3>\nIn RStudio there’s no need to fumble through your folder structure to find files, and there’s no need to dig for functions! Enter the shortcut <code>control/ctrl + .</code> to open the <code>Go to File/Function</code> window and then use your fuzzy matching skills to narrow your selection:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/open_file.gif">\n\n<h3>5. Customize the Appearance</h3>\nRStudio offers a wealth of options to customize the appearance to your liking. \nUnder the <code>RStudio</code> tab, navigate to <code>Preferences > Appearance</code> to explore the many options available. \nA nice feature of RStudio is that you can quickly click through the <code>Editor theme</code> window to preview each theme.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/RStudio_theme.png">\n\n<h3>6. Easy Links to Documentation</h3>\nUnder the <code>Help</code> tab in the lower-right window, you’ll find handy links to the online documentation for R functions and R packages. \nFor example, if we search for information about the <code>install.packages()</code> function using the search bar, the official documentation is returned:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/help.png">\n\nWe can also access documentation in the <code>Help</code> tab by prepending a package or function with <code>?</code>, (e.g. <code>?install.packages</code>) and running the command into the Console. \nWith either approach, RStudio auto-fills matching function names as you type!\n\n<h3>7. Preview and Save Your Plots</h3>\nPlots generated during an RStudio session are displayed under the <code>Plots</code> tab in the lower-right window. \nIn this window, you can inspect your plots by zooming in and out. \nIf you want to save your plot, you can save the plot as a PDF or image file.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/plot.png">\n\n<h3>8. Import and Preview Datasets</h3>\nRStudio makes it easy to import and preview datasets, no coding required! Under the <code>Environment</code> tab in the upper-right window, there is feature that enables you to import a dataset. \nThis feature supports a variety of formats:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/import.png">\n\nYou can even preview the dataset before it is loaded:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/import_options.png">\n\nAnd after the dataset is loaded into RStudio, you can view it with the <code>View()</code> command, or by clicking the name of the dataset:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/view.png">\n\n<h3>9. Review the Command History with One Click</h3>\nEarlier, we learned the shortcut to the command history from the console. \nRStudio also enables you to view your entire command history in the upper-right window by clicking the <code>History</code> tab:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/history.png">\n\n<h3>10. Save Your “Real” Work. Delete the Rest.</h3>\nPractice good housekeeping to avoid unforeseen challenges down the road. \nIf you create an R object worth saving, capture the R code that generated the object in an R script file. \nSave the R script, but don’t save the environment, or workspace, where the object was created.\n\nTo prevent RStudio from saving your workspace, open <code>Preferences > General</code> and un-select the option to restore <code>.RData</code> into workspace at startup. \nBe sure to specify that you never want to save your workspace, like this:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/never_save_workspace.png">\n\nNow, each time you open RStudio, you will begin with an empty session. \nNone of the code generated from your previous sessions will be remembered. \nThe R script and datasets can be used to recreate the environment from scratch.\n\n<h3>11. Organize Your Work with Projects</h3>\nRStudio offers a powerful feature to keep you organized; Projects. \nIt is important to stay organized when you work on multiple analyses. \nProjects from RStudio allow you to keep all of your important work in one place, including code scripts, plots, figures, results, and datasets.\n\nCreate a new project by navigating to the <code>File</code> tab in RStudio and select <code>New Project...</code>. \nYou have the option to create your new project in a new directory, or an existing directory. \nRStudio offers dedicated project types if you are working on an R package, or a Shiny Web Application.\n\nRStudio Projects are useful when you need to share your work with colleagues. \nYou can send your project file (ending in <code>.Rproj</code>) along with all supporting files, which will make it easier for your colleagues to recreate the working environment and reproduce the results.\n\nBut if you want seamless collaboration, you may need to introduce package management into your workflow. \nFortunately, RStudio offers a useful tool for package management, <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/">renv</a></code>, that is now compatible with RStudio projects. \nWe’ll cover <code>renv</code> next.\n\n<h3>12. Manage Package Versions with renv</h3>\nWe love R at Dataquest, but managing package versions can be a challenge! Fortunately, R package management is easier than ever, thanks to <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/" style="outline: none;">the <code>renv</code> (“reproducible environment”) package</a> from RStudio. \nAnd now, RStudio includes built-in support for <code>renv</code>.\n\nWe won’t get into the details of how to use <code>renv</code> with RStudio projects in this blog because RStudio provides you with the info you need in the link we provided and in the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">vignette</a>. \nBut using <code>renv</code> with RStudio can make R package management much easier, so we wanted to let you know!\n\nThe <code>renv</code> package is replacing <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/">the <code>Packrat</code> package</a> that RStudio used to maintain.\n\nTo use the <code>renv</code> package with your RStudio projects upgrade to the latest version of RStudio and then install the <code>renv</code> package with <code>library("renv")</code>. \nFrom there you will have the option to use <code>renv</code> with all new projects:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/renv_new.png">\n\nIf you would like to use <code>renv</code> with an existing project navigate to <code>Tools > Project Options > Environments</code> and check the box to enable <code>renv</code>:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/renv_existing.png">\n\n<h3>13. Manage Version Control with GitHub in RStudio</h3>\nIn addition to managing packages in RStudio, you can also use GitHub with RStudio to maintain version control of your projects and R scripts. \nCheck out <a href="https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/" style="outline: none;">this article from GitHub</a> and <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077?version=1.3.959&mode=desktop">this article from RStudio</a> for all the information you need to integrate Git into your RStudio workflow.\n\n<h3>14. Code Snippets</h3>\nRStudio offers a very useful feature for inserting common chunks of code, called code snippets. \nOne of our favorites is the <code>lib</code> snippet that saves you a bit of typing when calling the <code>library()</code> function to load an R package:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/snippet.png">\n\nAfter you hit return to select the snippet, the <code>library()</code> function is loaded and the cursor is positioned so you can immediately begin typing the name of the package you want to load:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/library.png">\n\nOur other favorite is the fun snippet that provides a basic template for writing a custom function. \nAnd you can even add snippets of your own! To learn more, check out <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets" style="outline: none;">this article</a> on code snippets from RStudio.\n\n<h3>15. Dig Into the Source Code of a Function</h3>\nIf you’d like to investigate the source code of a function, move your cursor to the function of interest and enter <code>F2</code> (on a Mac you may need to enter <code>fn + F2</code>). \nThis feature even works for functions loaded from any R packages you use.\n\n<h3>16. Function Extraction</h3>\nIf you’ve written a chunk of code that you want to turn into a function, highlight the code chunk and enter <code>control + option X</code> on a Mac, <code>Ctrl + Alt + X</code> on Linux/Windows. \nA pop-up will appear that will ask you to select a function name.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/extract_function.png">\n\nAfter the function name is selected, the inputs and code structure needed to turn your code into a function will be added automatically.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/extracted_function.png">\n\nIf you have a variable that you would like to extract, highlight the variable and enter <code>control + option V</code> on a Mac, <code>Ctrl + Alt + V</code> on Linux/Windows.\n\n<h3>17. Rename in Scope</h3>\nAt some point, you may need to change the name of a function or a variable used in one of your functions. \nBut using find and replace to do this can be nerve-wracking! Fortunately, RStudio makes it possible to rename in scope. \nThis means your changes will be limited to the variable or function of interest. \nThis will prevent you from accidentally replacing a variable of the same name elsewhere in your code script. \nTo use this feature select the function or variable you want to change and enter <code>control + shift + option + M</code> on a Mac, or <code>Ctrl + Shift + Alt + M</code> on Linux/Windows.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/scope.png">\n\n<h3>18. Multicursor Support</h3>\nRStudio supports multiple cursors. \nSimply click and drag your mouse while holding down <code>option</code> on a Mac, or <code>Alt</code> on Windows/Linux.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/cursor_select.png">\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/cursor_edit.png">\n\n<h3>19. Use Python with RStudio and reticulate</h3>\nRStudio supports coding in python. \nThe process to get python up and running within RStudio involves these general steps:\n\nInstall a base version of Python\nInstall <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code>\nCreate a Python environment in your RStudio project\nActivate your Python environment\nInstall desired Python packages in your environment\nInstall and configure the R <code>reticulate</code> package to use Python\n\n<a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023654474-Installing-and-Configuring-Python-with-RStudio" style="outline: none;">This article</a> provides the code you’ll need for the steps above. \nWe tried it out and were able to run python in RStudio in only a few minutes:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/python.png">\n\nFor full details, check out this <a href="https://docs.rstudio.com/tutorials/user/using-python-with-rstudio-and-reticulate/">RStudio tutorial</a>.\n\n<h3>20. Query SQL Using the DBI Package</h3>\nThere are many ways to run SQL queries in RStudio. \nHere are three of the most popular methods, beginning with the <code>DBI</code> package from R.\n\nYou’ll start by generating an in-memory SQL database to use in all your SQL query examples. \nYou’ll generate a SQL database of the well-known “mtcars” dataset. \nHere’s the code:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/create_db.png">Now write a SQL query to select all cars from the database with a four-cylinder engine. \nThis command returns a dataframe that you’ll save as <code>dbi_query</code>:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/dbi_query.png">\n\nThe dataframe looks like this:<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/dataframe.png">\n\n<h3>21. Query SQL in R Markdown or Using an R Notebook</h3>\nYou can achieve the same result in R Notebook or R Markdown by creating a <code>{sql}</code> code chunk. \nUsing the connection and database from the first example, run this code:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/sql_pure.png">\n\nSpecify <code>output.var = "mt_cars_df"</code> to save the results of your query to a dataframe. \nThis dataframe is a standard R dataframe that is identical to the one you generated in the previous example. \nYou can use this dataframe in R code chunks to perform analysis or to generate a ggplot, for example:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/ggplot_code.png">\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/Rplot.png">\n\n<h3>22. Query SQL with dbplyr</h3>\nFinally, you’ll use the <code>dbplyr</code> package to write standard <code>dplyr</code> commands that get converted to SQL! Once again, using the connection and database from the first example, you can write a standard <code>filter()</code> call to query the cars with four cylinders, this returns a list object:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/dbplyr_1.png">\n\nIf you want to see the SQL code that this command was converted to, you can use the <code>show_query()</code> function from <code>dbplyr</code>:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/dbplyr_2.png">When you’re satisfied with your query results, you use the <code>collect()</code> function from <code>dbplyr</code> to save your results as a dataframe:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/dbplyr_3.png">\n\nThere you have it! Three different approaches to querying a SQL database with similar results. \nThe only difference between the examples is that the <code>dbplyr</code> method returns a tibble, whereas the first two methods return a standard R dataframe.\n\nTo learn more about querying SQL databases with RStudio, check out <a href="https://db.rstudio.com/getting-started/database-queries/">this article</a>.\n\n<h3>23. Take it to the Cloud!</h3>\nRStudio now offers a cloud-based version of RStudio Desktop called, you guessed it… <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a>. \nRStudio Cloud allows you to code in RStudio without installing software, you only need a web browser.\n\nWork in RStudio Cloud is organized into projects similar to the desktop version, but RStudio Cloud enables you to specify the version of R you wish to use for each project.\n\nRStudio Cloud also makes it easy and secure to share projects with colleagues, and ensures that the working environment is fully reproducible every time the project is accessed.\n\nAs you can see, the layout of RStudio Cloud is very similar to RStudio Desktop:\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://dq-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio_tips/cloud.png">\n\n<h3>Bonus: Cheatsheets</h3>\nRStudio has published <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/" style="outline: none;">numerous cheatsheets</a> for working with R, including a detailed cheatsheet on using RStudio! Select cheatsheets can be accessed from within RStudio by selecting <code>Help > Cheatsheets</code>.\n',
'<h2>Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts in the RStudio IDE</h2>\n<h3>Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>\nYou can now customize keyboard shortcuts in the RStudio IDE -- you can bind keys to execute RStudio application commands, editor commands, or (using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/" target="_blank">RStudio Addins</a>) even user-defined R functions.\nAccess the keyboard shortcuts by clicking&nbsp;<code>Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...</code>:\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202570047/modify.png">\nYou will then see the set of available editor commands (commands that affect the current&nbsp;document\'s contents, or the current selection), alongside RStudio commands (commands whose actions are scoped beyond just the current editor).\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202570087/Screen_Shot_2015-07-31_at_12.49.32_PM.png">\nEach row represents a particular command binding -- the command\'s <k>Name</k>, the keyboard <k>Shortcut</k> it is bound to, and the <k>Scope</k> where that binding is active.\nYou can modify a command\'s shortcut by clicking on the cell containing the current shortcut key sequence, and typing the new sequence you\'d like to bind the command to. As you type, the current row will be marked to show that the binding has been updated, and the shortcut field will be updated based on the keys entered.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202570217/Screen_Shot_2015-07-31_at_12.52.59_PM.png">&nbsp;\nIf you made a mistake, you can press <code>Backspace</code> to clear a single key combination, or <code>Delete</code>&nbsp;to reset that binding to the&nbsp;original value it had when the widget was opened.\nCommands&nbsp;can be either a single \'key chord\'; for example, <code>Ctrl+Alt+F</code>, or also to&nbsp;a sequence of keys, as in <code>Ctrl+X Ctrl+F</code>.\nYou can also filter, based on the names of commands, by typing within the <code>Filter...</code> search box at the top left, to more easily find commands of interest:\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202644108/Screen_Shot_2015-07-31_at_12.55.42_PM.png">\nAfter you\'ve updated the bindings to your liking, click <code>Apply</code> and the shortcuts will be applied to the current session and saved for future sessions.\n<h3>Handling Conflicts</h3>\nBy default, RStudio application command bindings will override editor command bindings. If an editor command and an RStudio command are both bound to the same key sequence, the RStudio command will take precedence and the editor command will not be executed. Editor commands&nbsp;that are masked by an RStudio command will be crossed out and have a small icon showing the masking command:\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202570317/masked.png">\nIf two commands are bound to the same key sequence, then that conflict will be highlighted and displayed in yellow.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202644238/conflict.png">\n<h3>Saving and Loading</h3>\nThe RStudio keybindings are saved as JSON files in the directory <code>~/.R/rstudio/keybindings/</code> -- you can find the bindings for the editor and RStudio itself at:\n<k>RStudio 1.2 and prior</k>\n~/.R/rstudio/keybindings/rstudio_commands.json\n~/.R/rstudio/keybindings/editor_commands.json\n<k>RStudio 1.3+ (Windows)</k>\n~/AppData/Roaming/RStudio/keybindings/rstudio_bindings.json\n~/AppData/Roaming/RStudio/keybindings/editor_bindings.json\n',

'<h2>Reshape Data </h2>\nhttps://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html\nR provides a variety of methods for reshaping data prior to analysis. \n<h3>Transpose </h3>\nUse the t() function to transpose a matrix or a data frame. In the later case, rownames become variable (column) names. \n<code># example using built-in dataset \n  mtcars\n  t(mtcars)</code>\n<h3>The Reshape Package </h3>\nHadley Wickham has created a comprehensive package called <a href="http://had.co.nz/reshape/">reshape</a> to massage data. Both an <a href="http://had.co.nz/reshape/introduction.pdf">introduction</a> and <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v21/i12/paper">article</a> are available.

regression?</h3>\nA linear regression is a statistical model that analyzes the relationship between a response variable (often called y) and one or more variables and their interactions (often called x or explanatory variables). \nYou make this kind of relationships in your head all the time, for example when you calculate the age of a child based on her height, you are assuming the older she is, the taller she will be. \nLinear regression is one of the most basic statistical models out there, its results can be interpreted by almost everyone, and it has been around since the 19th century. \nThis is precisely what makes linear regression so popular. \nIt’s simple, and it has survived for hundreds of years. \nEven though it is not as sophisticated as other algorithms like artificial neural networks or random forests, according to a survey made by KD Nuggets, regression was the algorithm most used by data scientists in <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/09/poll-algorithms-used-data-scientists.html">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/12/top-data-science-machine-learning-methods.html">2017</a>. \nIt’s even predicted it’s still going to be the used in year <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/machine-learning-algorithm-2118.html">2118</a>!\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-2">Creating a Linear Regression in R.</h3>\nNot every problem can be solved with the same algorithm. \nIn this case, linear regression assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables. \nThis means that you can fit a line between the two (or more variables). \nIn the previous example, it is clear that there is a relationship between the age of children and their height.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dydmodel1 = glm(data = titanic_passenger, family = binomial(link= formula = survival~fare, logit = "" na.action="na.exclude) &lt;\nsummary(model1)\n911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911465/1_afqiyx.png">\n\nIn this particular example, you can calculate the height of a child if you know her age:\n\n$/text{Height} = a + /text{Age} * b$\n\nIn this case, “a” and “b” are called the intercept and the slope respectively. \nWith the same example, “a” or the intercept, is the value from where you start measuring. \nNewborn babies with zero months are not zero centimeters necessarily; this is the function of the intercept. \nThe slope measures the change of height with respect to the age in months. \nIn general, for every month older the child is, his or her height will increase with “b”.\n\nA linear regression can be calculated in R with the command <code>lm</code>. \nIn the next example, use this command to calculate the height based on the age of the child.\n\nFirst, import the library <code>readxl</code> to read Microsoft Excel files, it can be any kind of format, as long R can read it. \nTo know more about importing data to R, you can take <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-r-part-1">this DataCamp course</a>.\n\nThe data to use for this tutorial can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TcO4eVmpAn7gt4DbZ31HCz0t_gkca1Fp">here</a>. \nDownload the data to an object called <code>ageandheight</code> and then create the linear regression in the third line. \nThe <code>lm</code> command takes the variables in the format:\n\n<code>lm([target variable] ~ [predictor variables], data = [data source])</code>\n\nWith the command <code>summary(lmHeight)</code> you can see detailed information on the model’s performance and coefficients.\n\n<code>library(readxl)\nageandheight = read_excel("ageandheight.xls", sheet = "Hoja2") #Upload the data\nlmHeight = lm(height~age, data = ageandheight) #Create the linear regression\nsummary(lmHeight) #Review the results</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911465/2_asteeq.png  ">\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-3">Coefficients.</h3>\nIn the red square, you can see the values of the intercept (“a” value) and the slope (“b” value) for the age. \nThese “a” and “b” values plot a line between all the points of the data. \nSo in this case, if there is a child that is 20.5 months old, a is 64.92 and b is 0.635, the model predicts (on average) that its height in centimeters is around 64.92 + (0.635 * 20.5) = 77.93 cm.\n\nWhen a regression takes into account two or more predictors to create the linear regression, it’s called multiple linear regression. \nBy the same logic you used in the simple example before, the height of the child is going to be measured by:\n\n<em>Height = a + Age × b<sub>1</sub> + (Number of Siblings} × b<sub>2</sub></em>\n\nYou are now looking at the height as a function of the age in months and the number of siblings the child has. \nIn the image above, the red rectangle indicates the coefficients (b1 and b2). \nYou can interpret these coefficients in the following way:\n\nWhen comparing children with the same number of siblings, the average predicted height increases in 0.63 cm for every month the child has. \nThe same way, when comparing children with the same age, the height decreases (because the coefficient is negative) in -0.01 cm for each increase in the number of siblings.\n\nIn R, to add another coefficient, add the symbol "+" for every additional variable you want to add to the model.\n\n<code>lmHeight2 = lm(height~age + no_siblings, data = ageandheight) #Create a linear regression with two variables\nsummary(lmHeight2) #Review the results</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911465/3_yaepnf.png">\n\nAs you might notice already, looking at the number of siblings is a silly way to predict the height of a child. \nAnother aspect to pay attention to your linear models is the p-value of the coefficients.\nIn the previous example, the blue rectangle indicates the p-values for the coefficients age and number of siblings. \nIn simple terms, a p-value indicates whether or not you can reject or accept a hypothesis. \nThe hypothesis, in this case, is that the predictor is not meaningful for your model.\n\nThe p-value for age is 4.34*e-10 or 0.000000000434. \nA very small value means that age is probably an excellent addition to your model.\n\nThe p-value for the number of siblings is 0.85. \nIn other words, there’s 85% chance that this predictor is not meaningful for the regression.\n\nA standard way to test if the predictors are not meaningful is looking if the p-values smaller than 0.05.\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-4">Residuals</h3>\nA good way to test the quality of the fit of the model is to look at the residuals or the differences between the real values and the predicted values. \nThe straight line in the image above represents the predicted values. \nThe red vertical line from the straight line to the observed data value is the residual.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911465/4_pjp8qf.png">\n\nThe idea in here is that the sum of the residuals is approximately zero or as low as possible. \nIn real life, most cases will not follow a perfectly straight line, so residuals are expected. \nIn the R summary of the lm function, you can see descriptive statistics about the residuals of the model, following the same example, the red square shows how the residuals are approximately zero.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911465/5_nbcx2m.png">\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-5">How to test if your linear model has a good fit?</h3>\nOne measure very used to test how good is your model is the coefficient of determination or R2. \nThis measure is defined by the proportion of the total variability explained by the regression model.\n\n$R^2 = /frac{/text{Explained Variation of the model}}{/text{Total variation of the model}}$\n\nThis can seem a little bit complicated, but in general, for models that fit the data well, R2 is near 1. \nModels that poorly fit the data have R2 near 0. \nIn the examples below, the first one has an R2 of 0.02; this means that the model explains only 2% of the data variability. \nThe second one has an R2 of 0.99, and the model can explain 99% of the total variability.**\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911465/6.1_tnja1z.png">\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911466/7_uyik0q.png">\n\nHowever, it’s essential to keep in mind that sometimes a high R2 is not necessarily good every single time (see below residual plots) and a low R2 is not necessarily always bad. \nIn real life, events don’t fit in a perfectly straight line all the time. \nFor example, you can have in your data taller or smaller children with the same age. \nIn some fields, an R2 of 0.5 is considered good.\n\nWith the same example as above, look at the summary of the linear model to see its R2.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911466/8_udtgwq.png">\n\nIn the blue rectangle, notice that there’s two different R2, one multiple and one adjusted. \nThe multiple is the R2 that you saw previously. \nOne problem with this R2 is that it cannot decrease as you add more independent variables to your model, it will continue increasing as you make the model more complex, even if these variables don’t add anything to your predictions (like the example of the number of siblings). \nFor this reason, the adjusted R2 is probably better to look at if you are adding more than one variable to the model, since it only increases if it reduces the overall error of the predictions.\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-6">Don’t forget to look at the residuals!</h3>\nYou can have a pretty good R2 in your model, but let’s not rush to conclusions here. \nLet’s see an example. \nYou are going to predict the pressure of a material in a laboratory based on its temperature.\n\nLet’s plot the data (in a simple scatterplot) and add the line you built with your linear model. \nIn this example, let R read the data first, again with the <code>read_excel</code> command, to create a dataframe with the data, then create a linear regression with your new data. \nThe command <code>plot</code> takes a data frame and plots the variables on it. \nIn this case, it plots the pressure against the temperature of the material. \nThen, add the line made by the linear regression with the command <code>abline</code>.\n\n<code>pressure = read_excel("pressure.xlsx") #Upload the data\nlmTemp = lm(Pressure~Temperature, data = pressure) #Create the linear regression\nplot(pressure, pch = 16, col = "blue") #Plot the results\nabline(lmTemp) #Add a regression line</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911467/output_13_0_utufts.png">\n\nIf you see the summary of your new model, you can see that it has pretty good results (look at the R2and the adjusted R2)\n\n<code>summary(lmTemp)</code>\n<code>Call:\nlm(formula = Pressure ~ Temperature, data =

random. \nOtherwise means that maybe there is a hidden pattern that the linear model is not considering.\nTo plot the residuals, use the command <code>plot(lmTemp$residuals)</code>.\n\n<code>plot(lmTemp$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")</code>\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526911466/output_17_0_niceec.png">\n\nThis can be a problem. \nIf you have more data, your simple linear model will not be able to generalize well. \nIn the previous picture, notice that there is a pattern (like a curve on the residuals). \nThis is not random at all.\n\nWhat you can do is a transformation of the variable. \nMany possible transformations can be performed on your data such as adding a quadratic term $(x^2)$, a cubic $(x^3)$ or even more complex such as ln(X), ln(X+1), sqrt(X), 1/x, Exp(X). \nThe choice of the correct transformation will come with some knowledge of algebraic functions, practice, trial, and error.\n\nLet’s try with a quadratic term. \nFor this, add the term “I” (capital "I") before your transformation, for example, this will be the normal linear regression formula:\n\n<code>lmTemp2 = lm(Pressure~Temperature + I(Temperature^2), data = pressure) #Create a linear regression with a quadratic coefficient\nsummary(lmTemp2) #Review the results</code>\n<code>Call:\nlm(formula = Pressure ~ Temperature + I(Temperature^2), data = pressure)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min

residuals, which is good!\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-7">Detect Influential Points.</h3>\nIn your data, you may have influential points that might skew your model, sometimes unnecessarily. \nThink of a mistake on the data entry and instead of writing “2.3” the value was “23”. \nThe most common kind of influential point are the outliers, which are data points where the observed response does not appear to follow the pattern established by the rest of the data.\n\nYou can detect influential points by looking at the object containing the linear model, using the function <code>cooks.distance</code> and then plot these distances. \nChange a value on purpose to see how it looks on the Cooks Distance plot. \nTo change a specific value, you can directly point at it with <code>ageandheight[row number, column number] = [new value]</code>. \nIn this case, the height is changed to 7.7 of the second example:\n\n<code>ageandheight[2, 2] = 7.7\nhead(ageandheight)</code>\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th scope="col">age</th><th scope="col">height</th><th scope="col">no_siblings</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr><td>18  </td><td>76.1</td><td>0

the Cooks Distances. \nFor this, after creating the linear regression, use the command <code>cooks.distance([linear model]</code> and then if you want you can plot these distances with the command <code>plot</code>.\n\n<code>lmHeight3 = lm(height~age, data = ageandheight)#Create the linear regression\nsummary(lmHeight3)#Review the results\nplot(cooks.distance(lmHeight3), pch = 16, col = "blue")

be affecting the model. \nHere you can make decisions on this point, in general, there are three reasons why a point is so influential:\n\nSomeone made a recording error\n\nSomeone made a fundamental mistake collecting the observation\n\nThe data point is perfectly valid, in which case the model cannot account for the behavior.\n\nIf the case is 1 or 2, then you can remove the point (or correct it). \nIf it\'s 3, it\'s not worthy to delete a valid point; maybe you can try on a non-linear model rather than a linear model like linear regression.\n\nBeware that an influential point can be a valid point, be sure to check the data and its source before deleting it. \nIt’s common to see on statistics books this quote: “Sometimes we throw out perfectly good data when we should be throwing out questionable models.”\n\n<h3 id="LRegressiontopic-8">Conclusion</h3>\nYou made it to the end! Linear regression is a big LRegressiontopic, and it\'s here to stay. \nHere I presented a few tricks that can help to tune and take the most advantage of such powerful algorithm, yet so simple. \nYou also learned how to understand what\'s behind this simple statistical model and how you can modify it according to your needs. \nYou can also explore other options by typing “?lm” on the R console and looking at the different parameters not covered in here. \nIf you are interested in diving into statistical models, go ahead and check the course on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-modeling-in-r-part-1">Statistical Modeling in R</a>.\n',

'<h2>To hide internal functions</h2>\nWhen writing packages, it is sometimes useful to use leading dots in function names because these functions are somewhat hidden from general view. Functions that are meant to be purely internal to a package sometimes use this.\n\n"somewhat hidden" simply means that the variable (or function) won\'t normally show up when you list object with ls().\nTo force ls to show these variables, use ls(all.names=TRUE).\nBy using a dot as first letter of a variable, you change the scope of the variable itself.\n\nFor example:\nx <- 3\n.x <- 4\n\nls() # "x"\nls(all.names=TRUE) # ".x" "x" \nx # 3\n.x # 4\n',
'<h2>y ~ I(x^3)</h2>\nThe tilde operator is actually a function that returns an unevaluated expression, a type of language object. \n\nThe expression then gets interpreted by modeling functions in a manner that is different than the interpretation of operators operating on numeric objects.\n\nThe issue here is how formulas and specifically the "+, ":", and "^" operators in them are interpreted. \n\n(A side note: the correct statistical procedure would be to use the function poly when attempting to make higher order terms in a regression formula.) \n\nWithin R formulas the infix operators "+", "*", ":" and "^" have entirely different meanings than when used in calculations with numeric vectors. \n\nIn a formula the tilde (~) separates the left hand side from the right hand side. \n\nThe ^ and : operators are used to construct interactions so x = x^2 = x^3 rather than becoming perhaps expected mathematical powers. \n(A variable interacting with itself is just the same variable.)\n\nIf you had typed (x+y)^2 the R interpreter would have produced (for its own good internal use), not a mathematical: x^2 +2xy +y^2 , but rather a symbolic: x + y +x:y where x:y is an interaction term without its main effects. \n(The ^ gives you both main effects and interactions.)\n\n?formula\nThe I() function acts to convert the argument to "as.is", i.e. what you expect. \n\nSo I(x^2) would return a vector of values raised to the second power.\nThe ~ should be thought of as saying "is distributed as" or "is dependent on" when seen in regression functions. \nThe ~ is an infix function in its own right. \n\nYou can see that LHS ~ RHS is almost shorthand for formula(LHS, RHS) by typing this at the console:\n\n~\n(LHS,RHS)\n#LHS ~ RHS\n\nclass( \n~\n(LHS,RHS) )\n#[1] "formula"\nidentical( \n~\n(LHS,RHS), as.formula("LHS~RHS") )\n\n#[1] TRUE   # cannot use \nformula\n since it interprets its first argument\n',

but much less likely in machine learning.\n\nThis is a problem because machine-learning algorithms are much better capable to solve many real-world applications compared with the procedures we learned in statistics class (randomized experiments, significance tests, correlation, ANOVA, linear regression, and so on).\n\nExamples:\nYou have data on a patient (clinical data such as resting heart rate, laboratory values, etc.) and you want to predict whether this patient will likely suffer from a heart attack soon.\n\nYou have sensor data from machines (e.g., temperature, oil pressure, battery charge level, current consumption…) and you want to forecast which machines are likely to fail in the near future in order to prevent these failures (predictive maintenance).\nYou have data on a lot of customers and you want to predict which of the customer is likely interested in buying a certain new product (think “you might also like…”).\nYou have images, audio, or video data from, say, satellite images of rainforest districts, X-ray scans of patients, photos of microorganisms, etc., and you want a machine to automatically classify what the images contain (e.g., illegal deforestation, bone fracture, subspecies of microorganisms, …).\n\n(For this type of use case, read also <a rel="nofollow" href="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/how-to-build-your-own-image-recognition-app-with-r-part-1/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>).\nYou have text data, e.g.\nfrom customer e-mails, transcripts of speeches, tweets by politicians, etc., and you want a machine to detect machinelearningtopics in these texts (if you have a case like this, see also <a rel="nofollow" href="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.wordpress.com/2021/11/29/detecting-machinelearningtopics-in-mails-tweets-etc-how-to-create-a-text-classification-algorithm-from-scratch-in-r/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>).\n\nIn all of these examples, statistical models are used to solve the problem, but in a different way than how you learned it in “Introduction to Statistics”.\n\nIn this post I want to give you a brief introduction what “machine learning” means, what the differences to “classical” statistical procedures are, and how you can train a machine learning model in R for your own use case in 8 simple steps.\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-0">What is “machine learning”?</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nThink of a facial-recognition app.\n\nHow does the app know whether it’s John or rather Jane it’s looking at? \nA conventional approach would be: Create an exhaustive list of features about John which can be quantitatively measured for the computer to memorize.\n\nE.g.: Look for short, brown hair, a three-day beard, a prominent nose, a scar on the left forehead, the distance between his eyes is 10.4 centimeters, he often wears a black hat, etc., that’s John.\n\nThe problems with this approach are obvious:\nHard-coding these rules is tedious, especially if you want your app to be able to detect hundreds or thousands of different people.\nYou might have left out one or more important features that differentiate John from others.\n\nYou’re probably not a domain expert (e.g., a forensic scientist, a cosmetic surgeon, etc.) who has the time to study each face rigorously.\n\nThe machine-learning approach works differently: You feed a computer many pictures labelled “John” or “Jane”, and that’s it, you don’t provide any additional information – rather, you let the machine infer the important features which best discern John from Jane.\n\nIt might be that the form of the cheek bones are actually a better predictor of whether or not it’s John on the image, rather than the hair color or the distance between the eyes.\n\nYou don’t care, you let the machine figure it out.\n\nThus, this is a data-driven (inductive) approach, where a machine *learns* the rules how to classify faces (e.g., if X1 and X2 are present, then it’s likely John) from a set of training data.\n\nYou don’t specify these rules manually.\n\nThis is why machine learning is considered (a subfield of) artificial intelligence: The machine carries out tasks without being explicitly told what to do.\n\nWe will discuss how this “learning” works later in this post.\n\nImportantly, to make sure that your program is good at detecting John in <em>new and unseen</em> pictures (e.g., John not wearing a hat, having shaved), you usually reserve a number of pictures of John which are not used during training in order to validate the model (see how accurate the machine can predict out-of-sample, i.e.\ndata it hasn’t been trained on).\n\nIn sum, the essence of machine-learning is: A computer program learns from a set of training data which features are most important for the outcome you want to predict, and then the program can use the aquired skills to predict values in new data it hasn’t seen before.\n\nThis is the most important difference to standard statistical approaches where most often, all available data are used to determine the statistical relationship under study (e.g., all respondents from a survey, all patients in a randomized control study… are used to determine whether a vaccine is effective; your main goal is not to leave aside a subset of the study participants to later test the model with unseen new data; rather, your goal is to report the relationships in all of the present data).\n\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-1">The difference between (inferential) statistics vs. machine-learning, and typical examples</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nRoughly speaking, there are two types of statistical models: Models to explain vs. models to predict (see, e.g., <a rel="nofollow"

paper</a> about the “two cultures” in statistics by Leo Breiman, pioneer of machine-learning models such as the random forest which we will use in this post).\n\nTo keep it simple, I’m referring to the former as (inferential) “statistics” and to the latter as “machine-learning” (although machine-learning is a form of applied statistics as well, of course).\n\nHere is an overview table with explanations following below:\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td> <k>“Statistics”</k></td><td> <k>“Machine learning”</k></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Typical goal: Explanation</td><td>Typical goal:

differences between statistics and machine-learning\nStatistical models – models to explain – are most prevalent in the fields of economics, psychology, medicine, ecology, and related fields.\n\nThey typically seek to uncover causal relations, i.e.\nexplain relationships observed in the real world.\n\nExample: Does a low-carb diet, all other things being equal, lead to a lower risk of suffering from a heart attack? If you want to address this research question, you need a carefully designed study, either in the form of a randomized control trial, or observational data where you control for confounding factors (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.wordpress.com/2022/01/05/simple-examples-to-understand-what-confounders-colliders-mediators-and-moderators-are-and-how-to-control-for-variables-in-r-with-regression-and-propensity-score-matching/" target="_blank">here</a> is a tutorial on the difference between correlation and causation and what it means to control for confounding factors).\n\nThe most important thing is thus to get a good research design.\n\nThe statistical model, in the end, may be trivial, such as a simple significance test (what does this mean? –> cf.\n\n<a href="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.wordpress.com/2022/01/09/finally-understanding-what-statistical-significance-and-p-values-mean-a-simple-example-with-r-code/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>) between the number of heart attacks observed in the experimental vs. \nthe control group.\nBy contrast, in machine-learning you want to predict an outcome as accurately as possible.\n\nFor instance, you want to predict whether a person suffers from a heart attack or not, based on various clinical parameters.\n\n“Prediction” here does not necessarily refer to things that happen in the future, but more importantly to data that were previously unseen to the algorithm.\n\nYou thus want an algorithm that is able to accurately tell whether a person is about to suffer from a heart attack although the algorithm has not seen this particular person before.\nIn terms of X (cause) and Y (effect), therefore, most statistical studies are concerned with obtaining an estimate for X that is as unbiased as possible.\n\nFor instance, eating 100 g fewer carbohydrates per day, by how much does this lower my risk of getting a heart attack in the next year.\n\nA machine-learning model, by contrast, is more concerned with predicting Y as accurately as possible (see, e.g., <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.2.87" target="_blank">here</a>).\n\nIndeed – and this might come as a surprise to you – as this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-25/issue-3/To-Explain-or-to-Predict/10.1214/10-STS330.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by Shmueli shows (in the Appendix), you can have a model with <em>wrong</em> causal specifications about X that has greater predictive accuracy regarding Y as opposed to a model that represents the true data generating process.\n\nThis is because in big datasets, many features are often highly correlated (say, crime rate, unemployment rate, population density, education, income level etc.\n\nbetween counties) and if you have wrong assumptions but many, many variables highly correlated to the true predictors, you will end up with a model which is just as good or (for random reasons) even better at predicting your outcome under study.\n\nThis has famously lead people to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/files/papers/others/2008/anderson2008a.pdf" target="_blank">declare</a> that scientific methods are obsolete, “correlation is causation”, and that big data and machine learning can replace classical statistics.\n\nBut, we will soon learn the pitfall of this assumption.\nIn reality, the dichotomy of explanation (statistics) vs. prediction (machine-learning) is over-simplified.\n\nMany causal statistical studies also use their obtained model to predict new and unseen data.\n\nThis is in general a good idea because failing to do so contributes to what is known as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.abstract" target="_blank">replication crisis in science</a>.\n\nEffects from over-fitted models (“I have found a statistically significant interaction between gender and state of origin affecting the probability to get a promotion within the next three years, but this effect only shows in certain industries and only for respondents younger than 30”) are reported in scientific papers, and subsequent studies fail to replicate these often random findings.\n\nTherefore it is always good to perform out-of-sample tests even in explanatory studies such as medical randomized control trials.\n\nIf you claim to have found a causal relationship, but it cannot predict new data better than a random guess, then what is the real-world significance of your findings?\nConversely, machine-learning applications can benefit from considering causality, instead of dismissing it as unnecessary.\n\nAn example: Survey researchers and political pundits famously failed to predict Donald Trump’s win at the 2016 US presidential elections.\n\nWhy was that? The models they used were based on correlations, not causations.\n\nThey were working with statistical models where for each election district, the proportion of Republican vs. \nDemocrat votes was predicted based on the latest survey results enriched with regional parameters such as percentage of Black or White voters, average income, percentage highly educated voters, blue-collar workers, general region (Mid-West, South, New England, etc.).\n\nThese were all factors that were correlated with voting Republican or Democrat in the past, so the predictive accuracy of these models had been good.\n\nBut, it turned out that White male blue-collar workers from the Mid-West had not voted Democrat in the past <em>because of</em> their ethnicity, education, or region of residence.\n\nThese were just correlations without causal implications.\n\nWhen during the 2016 electoral campaigns, Democrats increasingly focused on machinelearningtopics such as identity politics which appealed more to well-educated urban voters rather than to blue-collar workers from the “rust belt”, many working-class voters favored Trump over Clinton.\n\nThis is an example where the causal relations changed over time, and as a consequence, predictive models built on surrogate correlations stopped working.\n\nThis is important, because in the same way, your machine-learning models predicting customer retention or machine failure may perform less well over time if the models disregard the true causal relations at work, and if these relationships change over time (e.g., your customer base gets older).\nAlright, I apologize for the lengthy introduction.\n\nHopefully, some of you are still following and this has made sense so far to you.\n\nThe bottom line is:\nIf you are concerned with identifying a causal effect (does my marketing campaign/ vaccine/ product design change/ illegal deforestation have an effect on my product’s sales/ patient survival rates/ social media likes/ athmospheric temperature…), then this is not the tutorial for you.\n\nLook e.g.\n<a rel="nofollow"

target="_blank">here</a>, instead.\nIf you want to train an algorithm to accurately predict new data, and you have some basic knowledge of R, let’s get to it.\n\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-2">Step 1: Get data</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nWe are using a small dataset here containing medical records of 303 patients, and we want to predict whether or not they have coronary heart disease.\n\nFor you to follow this tutorial, you can download the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.\n\n(If you don’t have a Kaggle account, there are many other places to find this dataset since it’s widely used as a training dataset).\n\nYou might recall from statistics or science classes that statistical studies usually start with a research question, theory, literature review, etc., so you might be confused why the first step is getting data rather than theoretical or conceptual considerations.\n\nWhile I’m not saying this is completely obsolete in a machine-learning project – see the example about the Trump vote above, and indeed it is good to have domain experts in your project team, as we will soon see -, it’s much less important compared with a causal research design.\n\nThe more complex a dataset and the less meaningful the features (e.g., pixel values of an image, thousands of columns of IoT data from sensors…), the less likely you add value to your data-driven model with theoretical insights.\n\nThus, keep in mind the point about changing underlying causal structures, but for now let’s focus on the data and modeling.\n\nDownload the file and move it to a folder of your choice, and then in R, run:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(caret)\n\nlibrary(party)\ndat = read.csv("C:/Users/User/Desktop/heart.xls")\nnames(dat)[[1]] = "age"\n\ndat$target = dplyr::recode(dat$target, \n0\n = 1L, \n1\n = 0L)\nWhere you of course replace “MyFolder” with the path to where you stored the dataset.\n\nAlso, you have to install the three packages via, e.g., <em>install.packages(‘tidyverse’)</em> if you don’t have them installed yet, which you will notice if R throws an error when executing the first three lines..\n\nFirst, let’s clean the data and check for duplicates or missing values.\nsapply(dat, function(x) table(is.na(x)))\ntable(duplicated(dat))\n\ndat = dat[!duplicated(dat),]\nThe first line gives us the number of missing cases for each column:\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-54.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-54.png" data-was-processed="true">\nMissing values (“TRUE”) by feature column\n\nWe see that missingness (is.na) is FALSE for all columns, which is great.\n\nThe second line in the code chunk above tells us that there is one duplicated record, which we remove in line 3.\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-3">Step 2: Visual inspection / descriptive statistics</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nThis is often the most important part, because it tells you most of what is going on in your data.\n\nLet’s start with a plot of histograms for all features.\n\nNote that if your data has 100 columns instead of only 14, you could divide your data into parts of, say, 25 columns each.\n\nJust start the following code chunk with, e.g., dat[,1:25] %>% …\ndat %>% gather() %>%\nggplot(aes(x=value)) + \ngeom_histogram(fill="steelblue", alpha=.7) +\ntheme_minimal() +\nfacet_wrap(~key, scales="free")\n\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-55.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-55.png" data-was-processed="true">\nHistograms of all our variables in our dataset\nHere you see the univariate distributions – univariate because you’re looking at one variable at a time, not at bivariate correlations at this point.\n\nThe most important variable to look at here is our Y, labeled “target”.\n\nThis is coded 1 for patients with heart disease, and 0 for healthy patients.\n\nYou can see that the data are not heavily imbalanced, there are only a few more healthy patients than patients with the disease.\n\nRegarding the other categorical features such as sex, you can also see from this graph whether they are imbalanced (1 = male, 0 = female here).\n\nWith regard to the continuous variables such as age or maximum heart rate achieved (“thalach”), you can visually check whether they are more or less normally distributed (such as age), or whether they exhibit some distribution that might need some form of normalization or discretization (e.g., “oldpeak”).\nYou can also see that there are some categorical variables where certain values are represented only rarely among the patients.\n\nFor instance, “restecg” has only very few instances of values == 2.\n\nWe will deal with this in a minute.\nLet’s move on to bivariate statistics.\n\nWe are plotting a correlation matrix, in order to\n a) check if we have features that are highly correlated (which is problematic for some algorithms), and\n b) get a first feeling about which features are correlated with the target (heart disease) and which are not:\n\ncormat = cor(dat %>% keep(is.numeric))\ncormat %>% as.data.frame %>% mutate(var2=rownames(.)) %>%\npivot_longer(!var2, values_to = "value") %>%\nggplot(aes(x=name,y=var2,fill=abs(value),label=round(value,2))) +\ngeom_tile() + geom_label() + xlab(") + ylab(") +\nggtitle("Correlation matrix of our predictors") +\nlabs(fill="Correlation/n(absolute):")\n\nThis prints the following correlation matrix:\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-56.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-56.png" data-was-processed="true">\nCorrelation matrix of all our predictor variables\n\nWe can see that aside from the diagonal (correlation of a variable with itself, which is 1), we have no problematically strong correlations between our predictors (strong meaning greater than 0.8 or 0.9 here).\n\nIf you have many, many features and don’t want to look at 1,000 by 1,000 correlation matrices, you can also print a list of all correlations that are greater than, say, 0.8 with the following code:\nhighcorr = which(cormat > .8, arr.ind = T)\n\npaste(rownames(cormat)[row(cormat)[highcorr]], \ncolnames(cormat)[col(cormat)[highcorr]], sep=" vs. ") %>%\n\ncbind(cormat[highcorr])\nNow let’s look at the bivariate relations between the predictors and the outcome.\n\nFor continuous predictors and a dichotomous outcome (heart disease or no heart disease), box plots are a good way of visualizing a bivariate association:\n\ndat %>% select(-c(sex,cp,ca,thal,restecg,slope,exang,fbs)) %>%\npivot_longer(!target, values_to = "value") %>%\nggplot(aes(x=factor(target), y=value, fill=factor(target))) +\n\ngeom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(size=.7, width=.1, alpha=.5) +\nscale_fill_manual(values=c("steelblue", "orangered1")) +\nlabs(fill="Heart disease:") +\n\ntheme_minimal() +\nfacet_wrap(~name, scales="free")\nI’ve de-selected the non-continuous variables in the first line here manually, because I haven’t transformed the categorical variables (say, “ca” or “restecg”) into factors yet, which is of course a bit lazy, but if you have hundreds of features, there are of course more flexible ways to keep only continuous variables for the following plot.\n\nThis is what the chunk above returns:\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-57.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-57.png" data-was-processed="true">\nBoxplots of the associations between our continuous predictors and the outcome\nYou can read this graph as follows: With regard to age, the patients with heart disease (red box) are on average older compared with the patients without heart disease (blue box).\n\nThe thick horizontal line within each box denotes the median.\n\nThe box encompasses 50% of all cases (i.e.\nfrom the 25 percentile to the 75 percentile).\n\nThe jitter points show you where all of the patients are located within each group.\n\nSo you see that, yes, heart disease patients are typically older, but you also have a couple of patients younger than 50 in the dataset who have coronary heart disease, and of course many older ones that are healthy.\n\nBut comparing the medians, you can see that age, oldpeak, and thalach are better predictors of heart disease compared with chol or trestbps, where the median values are almost equal in both groups.\n\nFor our categorical variables, we just use simple stacked barplots to show the differences between healthy and sick patients:\ndat %>% select(sex,cp,ca,thal,restecg,slope,exang,fbs,target) %>% \npivot_longer(!target, values_to = "value") %>%\n\nggplot(aes(x=factor(value), fill=factor(target))) +\nscale_fill_manual(values=c("steelblue", "orangered1")) +\ngeom_bar(position="fill", alpha=.7)+\n\ntheme_minimal() +\nlabs(fill="Heart disease:") +\nfacet_wrap(~name, scales="free")\n\nWhich gives us:\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-58.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/grafik-58.png" data-was-processed="true">\nAssociations between our categorical predictors and the outcome\nAgain, you can see at a glance that “fbs” is obviously not a strong predictor of heart disease, whereas “exang” definitely is.\n\nWe also see that males are overrepresented in sick patients compared with females.\nSo far, we have used very simple means to visualize the data.\n\nIn my experience, in many applied business use cases, you already know most of what you wanted to know at this stage! A few simple descriptive graphs and indicators most often show you what are the most important predictors, what are the important sub-groups you need to focus on in greater detail, where do you have outliers or a lot of missing data which distorts the overall picture, and so on.\n\nOften, the complicated algorithm later on only confirms what we have seen so far.\n\nSo it’s important not to skip this step and always do visual und descriptive inspection of your data.\nYou might ask, if in many cases bar charts and correlation coefficients is all we need to understand what is going on, why do we need the complicated machine-learning part? That is because while 80% of the explanation is often simple and can be inferred from looking at a graph or table, the other 20% is more complicated and requires domain knowledge and/or more sophisticated statistical analysis.\n\nOur example here perfectly illustrates this point: Older people suffer from heart disease more often than younger people; men are much more likely to get it compared with females; these findings are  trivial and everyone can see that from the graphs, no PhD in statistics required.\n\nAnd these simple associations can already guide clinical practice to a significant degree.\n\nYou’re an older male? You’re in a risk group.\n\nYou’re a young female? You’re probably fine.\n\nHowever, there are many more complex relationships at work.\n\nFor instance, females often present themselves with different forms of chest pain compared with males.\n\nThis is an example for an interaction effect that you couldn’t easily infer from the bivariate graphs above.\n\nNon-linearity, interaction effects, spurious correlations caused by third variables and multi-collinearity, complex data structures (e.g.\ntime series, nested data…) – these are examples of aspects that cause descriptive inspections to be insufficient when we not only want to find out the most obvious things (older people are more at risk than young people), but also want to get behind the more complex relations.\n\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-4">Step 3: Partition data into training and test datasets</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nAs you probably know, splitting data into training and test sets is of uttermost importance in order to avoid overfitting your model.\n\n“Overfit” is one of these ubiquitous terms in machine learning, let’s explain this briefly with two examples.\n\nSkip the next couple of paragraphs if this bores you.\nLet’s consider the following simple algorithm: “Whenever a patient is male, predict ‘heart disease’, otherwise predict ‘no heart disease’.” This algorithm would have an accuracy of 61% in our dataset, which you can verify by running:\npred = as.factor(ifelse(dat$sex==1,1,0))\n\nconfusionMatrix(pred,as.factor(dat$target))\nThis is better than nothing – always guessing “no heart disease” would be correct in 54% of cases, so the 61% of our “algorithm” are an improvement over this baseline (always check for class imbalance, i.e.\nthe majority class’ percentage in your outcome, this is your baseline).\n\nThis algorithm is often wrong – but we can be quite sure that it would be useful with <em>new</em> data to a similar degree (i.e.\naround 61% correct classifications), unless we have a very biased sample and in the total population, males are not suffering from heart disease more often than females.\n\nContrast this with the following algorithm: “If a person is 77 years old, predict ‘heart disease’.\n\nIf the person is 76 or 71 years old, however, predict ‘no heart disease’.\n\nIf the person is 69 years old, then it depends: If the serum cholesterol level is between 234 and 239 mg/dl, then predict ‘no heart disease’, but if it’s exactly 254 mg/dl, then predict ‘heart disease’.” And so on, until all of our 303 patients are captured by one of these very specific rules.\n\nYou get the idea: We would get an accuracy of 100% in our data if we continued like this.\n\n(By the way, you can generate a full set of these rules by growing a full-size decision tree, see below for example code).\n\nBut while this very complex algorithm can correctly classify 100% of our patients in the present dataset, it would probably perform very poorly with new patients.\n\nThis is because, for random reasons, all three patients aged 71 in our dataset were healthy whereas the one 77 year-old in our data was sick, but this can certainly not be generalized to a universal law: A new 71 year-old patient would always be classified as healthy by our algorithm, whereas all 77 year-olds would be predicted to have heart disease.\n\nThis is obviously nonsense and as a result, despite a supposed accuracy of 100%, our algorithm might fare even worse than the very simple “if male, then sick” rule when applied to new patients.\n\nThis is overfitting: The algorithm is too specific and captures everything in our data, even the random noise and idiosyncrasies (for whatever reasons, we have two 40 year-olds with coronary heart disease in our data but only one healthy 40 year-old).\n\nOn the one hand, thus, you should not “learn” from all this random noise and be too specific in your classification rules.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, you don’t want the algorithm to be too crude (e.g., simply predict a linear increase in diseases with age and nothing else) because you want to capture the true existing associations and interactions that are likely more complex.\n\nThis is ensured by judging your algorithm’s performance against an unseen new test dataset, i.e.\nout-of-sample.\n\nWe create a sequence of random numbers which encompass 70% of our dataset, designate this as “training”, and the rest as a test dataset which will not be touched again until the very end of the analysis:\nset.seed(2022)\nsplit = sample(1:nrow(dat), as.integer(0.7*nrow(dat)), F)\n\ntrain = dat[split,]\ntest = dat[-split,]\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-5">Step 4: Pre-processing and feature engineering</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nPre-processing means that you apply transformations to some or all variables in order to better be able to use them in your models.\n\nExamples: Some models such as neural networks work better if all variables are scaled to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.\n\nOr, if a feature has a very skewed distribution (e.g.\nmonthly income, where you have a few millionaires and an otherwise poor population), it might make sense to take the logarithm to normalize the variable.\n\nOr discretize, e.g.\ncreate 10 bins from “poorest percentile” to “richest percentile”.\n\nThis makes sense if theoretically, the difference between earning 1 Million per year and 2 Million per year is less important compared to the difference between earning 30,000 or 60,000 per year.\n\nBecause linear models (e.g., linear regression) give you estimates à la “earning one Euro more translates into an effect on Y the size of beta”, these estimates would be heavily influenced by the large numbers of the earners of 1M and 2M where not much changes between these numbers with regard to your Y.\nIn general, you get a good idea of what you have to do at this step by looking at the graph with the histograms above.\n\nWe saw that “age” or “thalach” were pretty much normally distributed, so there’s nothing to do here.\n\nBy contrast, “oldpeak” (which measures the S-T depression in an ecg under exercise relative to resting levels) has a skewed distribution: A significant number of patients don’t have any S-T depression, so it might make sense to transform the variable into a dichotomous or otherwise discretiziced variable.\n\nWe also want to transform nominal variables with multiple categories (e.g., ethnicity, blood type, etc.) into binary variables for each outcome (also called one-hot encoding, or “dummy variables”).\n\nSo instead of one variable with values 1 = Black, 2 = White,  3 = Asian, etc.\n\nyou would create several variables “ethnicity_black” (1 or 0), “ethnicity_white” (1 or 0), and so on.\n\nIn our dataset at hand, for instance, “cp” refers to 4 different chest pain types.\n\nSome algorithms such as tree-based models can deal with nominal variables, but others such as linear regression or neural networks usually cannot.\n\nThere are also a few outliers and data errors.\n\nFor instance, the description of the dataset notes that variable “ca” (number of major vessels colored by flouroscopy) has valid values 0 to 3, but we have one observation in the dataset where the value is 4.\n\nWe take this and a few other outliers and assign them the modal value (i.e.\nthe one that is most prevalent).\n\nDifferent strategies would be listwise deletion (i.e.\ndrop the whole patient as a case if one value seems suspicious) or multiple imputation (where you replace the value not with the modal value, as we do it here, but a bit more sophisticated based on a model that consideres the other variables as well).\n\nBesides pre-processing we could also do feature engineering at this point – that is, if we have enough domain knowledge to do so.\n\nI don’t.\n\nBut for the sake of demonstration, let’s just make something up.\n\nFeature engineering means that you create new variables out of the existing ones because of your knowledge about the data-generating process.\n\nFor instance, we have the maximum heart rate achieved in the dataset.\n\nBut we know that this is not only a function coronary heart disease, but is also affected by age.\n\nSo we could calculate the age-standardized heart rate by simply dividing the heart rate by the patient’s age.\n\nHere, too, it’s important for you to know that some algorithms (e.g.\ntree-based models) can map these type of interactions automatically (if given enough data) whereas others such as linear regression do not.\n\nThus, depending on the model, feature engineering is sometimes not needed at all (e.g., image recognition with convoluted neural networks which capture all interactions (e.g., neighboring pixel color values)), but in other applications it will affect your end result if you do meaningful transformations and interactions with your variables.\n\nWe create a function where we apply all of the pre-processing steps.\n\nThis allows us to later apply the same function to new data.\n\nFor instance, if in the end, you want to deploy your algorithm in an app for doctors to use, you take the new data, apply the pre-processing function we built here, and then let the model (which we will train in a minute) predict the data:\npreprocess_data = function(df){\n  #R Outliers are assigned the modal value\n  df = df %>% mutate(\n    restecg = recode(restecg, \n2\n=1L),\n    thal = recode(thal, \n0\n=2L),\n    ca = recode(ca, \n4\n=0L))\n\n  #Nominal variables\n  nomvars = c("cp", "ca", "thal", "restecg", "slope")\n  df[,names(df) %in% nomvars] = sapply(df[,names(df) %in% nomvars], as.character)\n  dummies = dummyVars(~ ., df)\n  df = predict(dummies, newdata = df) %>% as.data.frame\n  \n  #Age-standardized variables\n  df$hr_age = df$thalach / df$age\n  df$chol_age = df$chol / df$age\n\n  #Oldpeak: Is there any ST depression\n  df$st = ifelse(df$oldpeak>0,1,0)\n  return(df[,names(df)!="target"])\n}\n\nWe then apply the function to both our training and test datasets.\n\nWe also create vectors y_train and y_test which consist of only the target (heart disease 1 or 0).\n\nThis is not strictly necessary but the clear separation of predictors (x_…) and outcome (y_…) as well as the separation of train and test sets reduces the risk that you accidentally, say, train a model with the target included in the list of predictors, or apply some pre-processing function to your target, etc.\n\nx_train = preprocess_data(train)\nx_test = preprocess_data(test)\ny_train = factor(train[,"target"], levels=c(1,0))\ny_test = factor(test[,"target"], levels=c(1,0))\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-6">Step 5: Visualize exemplary algorithm</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nThis step is optional but it greatly helps you understand what is going on when you subsequently train a more complex algorithm on your data.\n\nWe are running and then plotting a simple algorithm, and in my opinion this is also great for presentation slides (e.g.\nfor management who don’t want to be bothered with the more technical details).\n\nWe choose a decision tree here, because this is the foundation of more complex algorithms such as random forests which are widely used with tabular data (3D or 4D data, e.g.\nimage recognition, is usually done with neural networks only).\n\nTrain a simple decision tree on our training data and plot the results:\n\nset.seed(2022)\ntree1 = party::ctree(y_train ~ .,\n  data=cbind(x_train, y_train), \n  controls = ctree_control(minsplit=10, mincriterion = .9))\nplot(tree1)\n\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik.png" data-was-processed="true">\nDecision tree on our training data\nHow do you read this tree? Starting from the top, the most important feature that can split the data in two most dissimilar subsets (with regard to how often heart disease occurs) is “thal2”, i.e.\nwether the patient has a normal blood flow as opposed to a defect from a blood disorder called thalassemia.\n\nIf the patient has a normal blood flow (value > 0 , i.e.\n1), then we continue to the right branch of the tree, if not, continue to the left.\n\nIf the blood flow is normal, then the next most important variable is “thalach”, i.e.\nthe maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.\n\nYou can see that if this is greater than 155 bpm, then we continue to the right where we then check for “ca1”, i.e.\nwhether one major vessel was colored by flouroscopy.\n\nI’m just pretending here to understand what any of this means, but recall the bar chart above where we saw that 0 vessels colored by flouroscopy was associated with the lowest proportion of patients with coronary heart disease, whereas those with 1, 2 or 3 colored vessels were predominantly diagnosed with heart disease.\n\nIn our tree, if ca1 == 0, i.e.\n<em>not </em>one major vessel colored, we continue to the left where we reach the end note 14 (second bar from the right).\nWhat do the bars on the bottom of the chart mean? They show the proportion of patients in each bucket with (light grey) vs. without (dark grey) heart disease.\n\nMeaning that end node 14 (second bar from the right) is the group of patients with the lowest risk of having coronary heart disease.\n\nThus, our algorithm here finds that if you:\ndon’t have thalassemia,\ncan achieve a heart rate of more than 155 bpm while exercising, and\ndon’t have one major vessel colored by flouroscopy,\n\nthen we predict “no heart disease” with a 98% probability (i.e.\nthe proportion of healthy patients in the respective bucket).\n\nIf, by contrast, you do have thalassemia, there are 1 or more colored major vessels, and your chest pain type (cp) is not “2” (2 standing for non-anginal pain), then the algorithm predicts “heart disease” with a high confidence.\n\nYou can also see that there are several end node buckets (e.g., node 5, node 15) which are quite mixed.\n\nPatients with these combinations of features are not well understood by the algorithm and the predictions are often wrong for these groups.\n\nNow, recall what we discussed about overfitting: Of course we could go into these groups and find more features that separated the healthy from the sick patients.\n\nIn fact, if you set the values “minsplit” (minimum number of cases separated at a split) to 1, “minbucket” (minimum number of patients in an endnote) to 0, and “mincriterion” to a small value (p-value to determine if a split is significant), you get a vastly overfitted tree.\n\nLet’s try it out:\nset.seed(2022)\n\ntree2 = party::ctree(y_train ~ ., data=cbind(x_train, y_train), \ncontrols = ctree_control(minsplit=1, mincriterion = 0.01,minbucket = 0))\nplot(tree2)\n\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-1.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-1.png" data-was-processed="true">\nOverfitted tree\nAs you can see, just like we discussed above when we were warning against the dangers of overfitting, the algorithm has come up with very specific rules that often only apply to 2 or 3 people in the dataset.\n\nFor instance, if the maximum heart rate achieved is above 109, but below 144, and the patient is male, older than 59 and does not suffer from thalassemia, the algorithm always predicts heart disease.\n\nYou can see why this type of algorithm would perform poorly with new, unseen data.\n\nWe would want to “prune” this tree of nodes that introduce classification rules that are too idiosyncratic/specific to the training data.\n\nBut of course we don’t want to prune nodes that reflect true causal relations, i.e.\nthe actual data-generating process (which is obviously unknown to us).\n\nThus, the challenge in any machine-learning model is to get an algorithm that classifies the data with as specific rules as necessary, but without getting too specific and overfit to the training data.\n\nIn your real-world application, of course, you don’t grow the second (overfitted) tree, but you can use the first one for presentation slides and as a benchmark for the models which we are about to train.\n\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-7">Step 6: Model training</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nWe now have a pretty good idea about how the data look like, which factors are associated with the outcome, and thus what to expect from a more complex algorithm.\n\nLet’s start with a random forest which is basically an ensemble of many trees as the one we built in the previous section.\n\nThe trick is that each tree is grown with only a random subset of all features considered at each node, and in the end all trees take a vote how to classify a specific patient.\n\nTaking a subset of all features at each run ensures that the trees are less correlated, i.e.\nnot all of them use the same rules as the example tree shown above.\n\nIf there are a few dominant features (such as thalassemia or maximum heart rate in our data), then there will be some trees in our forest grown without these dominant features.\n\nThese trees will be better able to classify the subgroup of our patients for whom, for whatever reasons, thalassemia and maximum heart rate are not good predictors of heart disease.\n\nImagine that for some patients with a specific genetic make-up or a specific pre-existing condition (which we don’t have as information in our dataset so our algorithms cannot use it for classification), factors other than thalassemia and maximum heart rate are important to classify heart disease.\n\nOur first tree in the previous section would be confused about what to predict for these patients.\n\nIn our forest, however, there are trees that understand these patients as well.\n\nThus, an ensemble of learners such as a random forest most often outperforms a single learner.\n\nWe use the wrapper function <em>train()</em> from the <em>caret </em>package to train a random forest on our data.\n\nNote that the author of the <em>caret </em>package, Max Kuhn, has moved on to developing the <em>tidymodels</em> package.\n\nI haven’t adapted my workflow to the new package family yet, but for this example here, it doesn’t really matter which package you are using, <em>caret</em> still works just fine (especially since it only provides the wrapper function here which calls the <em>randomforest</em> package).\n\nset.seed(2022)\nmod = caret::train(x_train, y_train, method="rf", \n  tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = seq(5,ncol(x_train),by=5)),\n  trControl = trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter = T))\nmod\n\nWith “method = ‘rf\'” we tell the train() function to use a random forest.\n\nThe <em>tuneGrid</em> argument tells the function which values to try out for tuning parameter “mtry”.\n\nThis is a so-called hyperparamter.\n\nAs we just discussed, a random forest takes a subset of all features (variables) at each tree node.\n\nThe “mtry” parameter specifies how many of the features to consider at each split.\n\nWe have 27 features in our training dataset, so if you set mtry == 27, then it’s not a random forest any more, because all features are used and no random selection is applied.\n\nIf you set mtry == 1, then the trees will be totally different from each other, but most ones will perform poorly because they are forced to use certain variables at the top split which are maybe not useful.\n\nThe lower mtry, the more decorrelated the trees are, and the higher the value, the more features each tree can consider and thus the better the performance of a single tree.\n\nSomewhere between 1 and 27 is the optimal value, and there is no theoretical guidance as to which value should be taken.\n\nIt depends on your data at hand, how correlated the features are, whether there are distinct sub-groups where the causal structure of the features works differently, and so on.\n\nThe point is: You cannot determine this with “theory” or with general methodological knowledge.\n\nTherefore you have to “tune” these hyperparameters, i.e.\ntry out different values and see which one works best.\n\nNote the difference to the classical statistical approach.\n\nIn a vaccine effectiveness study, you wouldn’t expect to read that the author tried out different models (logit, probit, linear probability, and whatnot) and different parameters until the coefficient of interest (effectiveness of the vaccine) was maximized, this would be considered a violation of academic integrity.\n\nMachine learning, by contrast, in the words of deep learning pioneer Francois Chollet, “isn’t mathematics or physics, where major advances can be done with a pen and a piece of paper.\n\nIt’s an engineering science” (<em>Deep Learning with R</em>, 2018, Manning).\n\nYou try out different things and use what works best.\n\nJust remember that since you’re optimizing a prediction of Y, you cannot infer causal statements about X.\n\nHyperparameter tuning is done in the train() function with the <em>tune.grid</em> parameter, where we tell the function to try out values between 5 and the number of our variables (<em>ncol(x_train)</em>).\nFinally, note that in the “trainControl” function passed to train(), we specified “method = ‘cv\'”.\n\nCV stands for “cross validation”.\n\nAbove we stressed the importance of separating training and test datasets.\n\nBut inside our training routine, where we try out multiple varations of the random forest algorithm with different values for the parameter “mtry”, how does the function determine which of the specifications “works best”? We don’t touch the test dataset so far.\n\nWhich means we have to create another random split, splitting the training data into training and validation sets for the purpose of determining which algorithm works best on the training data.\n\nSince we set “number = 5”, the function creates a validation set of size 1/5 of x_train and takes 4/5 of the data for training.\n\nNow, this would mean we would lose more cases, from 211 patients in our training data we would only use 169 for the actual training.\n\n“Cross validation” therefore repeats this training process and changes the validation set to another fifth of the data.\n\nThis is done 5 times in total, so that all parts of the data served as validation set once, and then the results are averaged.\n\nThis routine thus lets you use all of your training data and still have train/validation splits in order to avoid overfitting.\n\nRunning the code chunk above gives us the following output:\n\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-2.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-2.png" data-was-processed="true">\nSummary of model training (random forest)\nWhat does this mean? From the summary we can verify that we set up our dataset correctly.\n\nThere are 27 features, 211 patients, and two outcomes (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).\n\nThen you see that five values were tried for the hyperparameter “mtry”.\n\nWith each of the values, 5-fold cross validation was performed.\n\nIf you look at the accuracy values, you can see that mtry = 10 worked best with our data.\n\nOn average (of the five runs using cross-validation), 82.4% of the validation sets (= 42 patients during each run) were classified correctly.\n\nAlthough this accuracy was obtained with a train/validation split, we still have yet to judge the final evaluation score of the algorithm against the unseen test dataset, because all the patients in the training data were used to train the model at some point, so technically it’s not an “out-of-sample” accuracy.\n\nBut before the final evaluation, we want to try out a few more algorithms.\n\nWith a random forest, you can obtain a feature importance plot which tells you which of the variables were most often used as the important splits at the top of the trees.\n\nJust run:\nplot(varImp(mod), main="Feature importance of random forest model on training data")\n\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-3.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-3.png" data-was-processed="true">\nFeature importance plot of our random forest\nYou can see that, unlike our single decision tree on all of the training data, where “thal2” was the most important feature before “ca0”, across an ensemble of 500 different trees, it’s actually “ca0” (= zero major vessels colored by flouroscopy, whatever that means) that ends up the most important predictor, tied with “cp0” (chest pain type 0 = asymptomatic).\n\nRecall that a machine-learning model tuned for prediction such as a random forest cannot be interpreted as revealing causal associations between the predictors and the outcome.\n\nNevertheless, it can guide clinical practice knowing which features are the most useful for predicting heart disease.\n\nThis best works when enriched with domain knowledge about mechanisms and causality.\nNext, let’s try out a neural network, simply because many of you will probably associate machine-learning or artificial intelligence in general with artificial neural networks, or deep learning.\n\nIn general, it is true that neural networks outperform all other machine-learning algorithms when it comes to the classification of abstract data such as images or videos.\n\nFor a more detailed tutorial about how you can build a deep learning algorithm in R, see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/how-to-build-your-own-image-recognition-app-with-r-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a>.\n\nIn cases with classical flat data files such as ours, on the other hand, other algorithms often work equally well or better.\n\nHere, let’s use a simple network with as few lines of code as necessary:\nset.seed(2022)\nmod2 = caret::train(x_train, y_train, method="avNNet",\n\npreProcess = c("center", "scale", "nzv"),\ntuneGrid = expand.grid(size = seq(3,21,by=3), decay=c(1e-03, 0.01, 0.1,0),bag=c(T,F)),\ntrControl = trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter = T),\n\nimportance=T)\nmod2\nHere we use the pre-processing steps of centering and scaling the data because, as noted above, neural networks are optimized more easily if the features have similar numerical ranges, instead of, say, maximum heart rate being in the range of 140-200 whereas other features having values bounded by 0 and 1.\n\nNear-zero variance (“nzv”) means that we disregard features where almost all patients have the same value.\n\nTree-based methods such as random forests are not as sensitive to these issues.\n\nWe have a few more tuning parameters here.\n\n“Size” refers to the number of nodes in the hidden layer.\n\nOur network has an input layer of 27 nodes (i.e.\nthe number of features) and an output layer with one node (the prediction of 1 or 0) and in between, a hidden layer where interactions between the features and non-linear transformations can be learned.\n\nAs with other hyperparameters, the optimal size of the hidden layer(s) depend on the data at hand, so we just try out different values.\n\nDecay is a regularization parameter that causes the weights of our nodes to decrease a bit after each round of updating the values after backpropagation (i.e.\nthe opposite of what the learning rate does wich is used in other implementations of neural networks).\n\nWhat this means is, roughly speaking, we don’t want the network to learn too ambitiously with each step of adapting its parameters to the evidence, in order to avoid overfitting.\n\nAnyway, as you can see from the code, we have passed 7 different values for “size” to consider, 4 values for “decay”, and two for “bag” (true or false, specifying how to aggregate several networks’ predictions with various random number seeds, which is what the <em>avNNet</em> classifier does, bagging = bootstrap aggregating), so we have 7*4*2 = 56 combinations to try out.\n\nThe result:\n\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-4.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-4.png" data-was-processed="true">\nOutput of neural network training\nThus, our best-performing model yields 85.3% accuracy, which is a slight improvement over the random forest.\n\nAgain, we can look at a feature importance plot:\n\nplot(varImp(mod2), main="Feature importance of neural network classifier on training data")\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-5.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-5.png" data-was-processed="true">\nFeature importance plot with neural network\nIt’s slightly different than the plot before, but the top five features are the same, just in a different order.\n\nNote that with “unstable” methods such as neural networks, if you run the same code 10 times, you can end up with ten (slightly) different feature importance lists, but the general pattern of which features are important and which aren’t will be the same.\nLet’s try out one last algorithm.\n\nThe popular “(extreme) gradient boosted machines” (xgboost) work similar to a random forest, except they proceed sequentially: A first tree is grown, then more weight is put on the badly predicted samples before the next tree is grown.\n\nAs a result, in many cases, xgboost outperforms random forests.\n\nLet’s see if this is the case here as well:\nset.seed(2022)\n\nmod3 = caret::train(x_train, y_train, method="xgbTree", \ntuneGrid = expand.grid(nrounds=c(50,100),max_depth=c(5,7,9),\ncolsample_bytree=c(0.8,1),subsample=c(0.8,1),\n\nmin_child_weight=c(1,5,10),eta=c(0.1,0.3),gamma=c(0,0.5)),\ntrControl = trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter = T))\nmod3\n\nplot(varImp(mod3), main="Feature importance of XGBoost model on training data")\nHere we have more tuning parameters compared with the random forest; I just inserted a few values that I deemed plausible into the tuning grid, but if you want to do serious hyperparameter tuning, you can of course spend a bit more time here determining which combination of parameters works best.\n\nXgboost is in general quite fast so even though we try out 2*3*2*2*3*2*2 = 288 parameter combinations, running this code should only take a minute at most even on a local machine.\n\nWhich means that you could tune even more.\nCompare the performance of the three algorithms:\nresults = data.frame(Model = c(mod$method,mod2$method, mod3$method),\n\nAccuracy = c(max(mod$results$Accuracy), max(mod2$results$Accuracy), max(mod3$results$Accuracy)))\nresults %>% ggplot(aes(x=Model, y=Accuracy, label=paste(round(100*Accuracy,1),"%"))) +\ngeom_col(fill="steelblue") + theme_minimal() + geom_label() +\n\nggtitle("Accuracy in the training data by algorithm")\n<img class="lazy loaded"

our used algorithms during model training\nThe neural network actually performed slightly better than the xgboosted tree, although the values are quite similar and if you repeat the model training a couple of times, you might get different results.\n\nWith use cases like this, I prefer to go with tree-based models such as random forests or xgboost over neural networks because with the former, I can understand better how the algorithm arrives at its predictions (see our example tree in the previous section).\n\nYou could also, of course, visualize a neural network with all the weights obtained during training displayed next to the nodes, it’s not alchemy, but it’s less easily interpreted when you want to reconstruct how the network processes a certain patient.\n\nAnyways, let’s decide at this point that our neural network (“mod2”) was the best model and we want to move forward with it.\n\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-8">Step 7: Model evaluation against the test data</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nWe now compare our model’s prediction against the reserved test dataset.\n\nThese are patients our algorithm has not seen before.\n\nWe use the neural network to predict the test data, and then compare the predictions against the actual outcomes:\npredictions = predict(mod2, newdata = x_test)\nconfusionMatrix(predictions, y_test)\n\nWhich gives us:\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-7.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-7.png" data-was-processed="true">\nConfusion matrix and summary statistics of our predictions on the test set\nAs you can see, our out-of-sample predictive accuracy was 87.9%.\n\nThe confusion matrix tells us that 40 patients with heart disease were correctly classified, and 40 healthy patients were also correctly classified, but there were 3 patients where our model thought they had heart disease but in reality they didn’t, and, conversely, we overlooked coronary heart disease in 8 patients.\n\nIn addition to accuracy, other metrics are often used to evaluate the goodness of a machine-learning algorithm.\n\nKeep in mind that our sample was balanced (47% have heart disease, 53% don’t), whereas in many other use cases, you often have a severe class imbalance (e.g., 99% of customers won’t buy, 1% do buy, or 99% of patients won’t die vs. \n1% die), so “99% accuracy” is useless to you as an indicator in these cases.\n\nYou can resort to using sensitivity/specificity which are also given in the output (specificity = how many of the true positive cases are detected, which is a useful indicator if the positive cases are rare, and specificity = how many true negatives are correctly classified).\n\nWhich of these metrics is more important to you depends on your case, i.e.\nyour cost function.\n\nIn this case, I’d say it’s better to detect all true cases who have the disease, and we can live with a few false positives, so I’d look at sensitivity rather than specificity.\n\nIn other cases, you want to avoid many false positives (e.g., spam detection, it’s much more annoying if many of your important work e-mails disappear in the spam folder), so sensitivity is maybe more important.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, you also often find precision (proportion of true positive predictions relative to all “positive” predictions), and recall (proportion of true positive predictions relative to all actual positives), and F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall).\n\nYou can get these as well with \nprecision(predictions, y_test)\n\nrecall(predictions, y_test)\nF_meas(predictions, y_test)\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-9">Step 8: Model deployment</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nWe don’t cover this step here in great detail, you can refer <a rel="nofollow" href="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.wordpress.com/2021/03/30/how-to-build-your-own-image-recognition-app-with-r-part-2/" target="_blank">here</a> for an example of how you can build a shinyapp which you can access from your computer or phone to send new data to your machine-learning model.\n\nThis type of app could be used by a doctor to enter a patient’s new values and get the prediction of whether or not coronary heart disease is present (I guess a doctor would be able to figure that out without a machine-learning model with the clinical diagnostics used to get the data, but you get the idea.\n\nFor instance, if you were to build a model that does not rely on data that you can only gather in a hospital, such as results from flouroscopy, but rather on data that come solely from standard instruments that every ambulance is carrying, such as ECG, blood pressure, etc., or maybe even recorded by the patients at home themselves, then the whole thing might make more sense.\n\nBut again, this is just an example for demonstration purposes).\nLet’s just quickly show how you would process new data.\n\nImagine you have an app, or a spreadsheet, etc., where a doctor can input new data for a new patient.\n\nYou read in the spreadsheet, or collect the input data from the app, but here for the sake of demonstration we just enter a new patient’s information like this: \nnewpatient = data.frame(age=62,sex=1,cp=0,trestbps =130,chol=220, fbs=0, restecg=0, \nthalach=161, exang=0, oldpeak=0, slope=0, ca=0, thal=2)\n\nNow unfortunately we cannot just use the preprocessing function we created earlier, because the new dataset does not have all the values for all our dummy variables (e.g., there is only cp == 0 in the new dataset and no instances of 1, 2 or 3).\n\nWhich is why we copy the function from above but insert a bit of new code to ensure that all dummy variables are present in the new dataset.\n\nIt’s an ugly nested for-loop but whatever works….\n\npreprocess_new_data = function(df){\n#Convert features to int like the original dataset\ndf[,names(df) != "oldpeak"] = purrr::map_df(df[,names(df) != "oldpeak"], as.integer)\n\ndf = df %>% mutate(restecg =

and the two other objects needed to pre-process new data.\n\nFrom now on, when in a new session (or an interactive app etc.), you just need to load the RData file and the libraries (caret, tidyverse), and you can then predict new data as follows:\npredict(mod2, newdata = preprocess_new_data(newpatient))\npredict(mod2, newdata = preprocess_new_data(newpatient), type="prob")\n\nResult:\n<img class="lazy loaded" data-src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-8.png" src="https://forloopsandpiepkicks.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/grafik-8.png" data-was-processed="true">\nPrediction of a new patient (binary and with probabilities)\nThe first command just predicts yes or no.\n\nFor this new patient, we predict “no heart disease”.\n\nWith the second command, we also get the probabilities to belong in each class.\n\nWe see that the new patient has a 86% probability of being healthy and a 13.9% probability of having coronary heart disease according to our algorithm.\n\nEspecially with new data I find it helpful to get the predicted probabilities to get a sense for how certain the algorithm is in assigning this prediction.\n\n<h3 id="machinelearningtopic-10">Next steps</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nAfter a model is deployed, you often might want to monitor its performance, maybe re-train with new training data when you have collected more real data over time, or when you have learned more things about the causal structure behind your predictions, or when there’s a new fancy algorithm which could improve accuracy compared to your current best model.\n\nSome final remarks: In my experience, the two steps that take up most of the time in a real-world use case are the first and the last one.\n\nIn the toy examples used to teach machine learning (such as this one), “get data” just means read in a csv file which is readily available at some url.\n\nIn reality, you often have to find a way to get your data from, say, an old SQL server located somewhere in a production plant, or a cloud storage (e.g.\nAWS S3), or worse, from various physical machines (e.g.\nECG devices in a hospital).\n\nThus, the most complicated part of the whole project is often to get access to the data (e.g., query an API with the <em>httr </em>package, or get credentials for a SQL server and then connect to the server with the <em>DBI </em>package), write queries to retrieve the data (e.g.\nvia SQL code which you can write in R with, e.g., the <em>dbplyr </em>package), schedule your queries so that you regularly get the latest data (e.g., daily cronjob for your R script on a Linux server), merge the data with other relevant datasets – what are we even looking for, what do we need? – and store it somewhere were you can access it for your model training.\nSimilarly, in the end, you want to deploy your model which might mean setting up a pipeline where new data from the source systems (ECG devices, SQL servers in plants, IoT sensors, etc.) run through your model and the output can be accessed via some app, or is integrated into your company’s BI solution, etc.\n\nThis can get complicated in many ways as well.\n\nBy contrast, the whole model training is easy in comparison, especially with packages such as tidymodels, caret, keras/tensorflow, Python’s scikit-learn, or various auto-ML packages which make the whole process of pre-processing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning etc.\n\nvery easy.\n\nI’ve read somewhere that it’s the best kept secret among data scientists and machine-learning engineers that they actually just run “import scikit-learn as sklearn” or “library(caret)” and then something such as “train(x,y,model = “fancy_algorithm”) rather than hand-crafting complicated models which many people outside of data science probably think they are doing.\nLet’s hope they won’t find out\nIn my view, thus, the most important skill for you to bring to the table as an aspiring data scientist/machine-learning engineer isn’t so much the ability to write down tensorflow code from scratch.\n\nRather, it’s the ingenuity to come up with new ideas for how to use existing data to solve business problems or scientific research questions.\n\nThis kind of skill will hardly get automated in the near future.',

Benefits</a>\n<a href="#WhatisRFtopic-6" target="_self" onclick="jumpto(6)">Key Challenges</a>\n</div></center>\n\nRandom forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm that combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. \n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-0">Decision trees</h3>\nSince the random forest model is made up of multiple decision trees, it would be helpful to start by describing the decision tree algorithm briefly. \n\nDecision trees start with a basic question, such as, “Should I surf?”\nFrom there, you can ask a series of questions to determine an answer, such as, “Is it a long period swell?” or “Is the wind blowing offshore?”. \nThese questions make up the decision nodes in the tree, acting as a means to split the data. \n\nEach question helps an individual to arrive at a final decision, which would be denoted by the leaf node. \nObservations that fit the criteria will follow the “Yes” branch and those that don’t will follow the alternate path. \nDecision trees seek to find the best split to subset the data, and they are typically trained through the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm. \n\nMetrics, such as Gini impurity, information gain, or mean square error (MSE), can be used to evaluate the quality of the split. \nThis decision tree is an example of a classification problem, where the class labels are "surf" and "don\'t surf."\nWhile decision trees are common supervised learning algorithms, they can be prone to problems, such as bias and overfitting. \n\nHowever, when multiple decision trees form an ensemble in the random forest algorithm, they predict more accurate results, particularly when the individual trees are uncorrelated with each other.\n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-1">Ensemble methods</h3>\nEnsemble learning methods are made up of a set of classifiers\n— e.g. decision trees\n— and their predictions are aggregated to identify the most popular result. \n\nThe most well-known ensemble methods are bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregation, and boosting. \nIn 1996, Leo Breiman introduced the bagging method; in this method, a random sample of data in a training set is selected with replacement—meaning that the individual data points can be chosen more than once. \n\nAfter several data samples are generated, these models are then trained independently, and depending on the type of task—i.e. regression or classification—the average or majority of those predictions yield a more accurate estimate. \nThis approach is commonly used to reduce variance within a noisy dataset.\n\n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-2">Random forest algorithm</h3>\nThe random forest algorithm is an extension of the bagging method as it utilizes both bagging and feature randomness to create an uncorrelated forest of decision trees. \nFeature randomness, also known as feature bagging or the random subspace method (link resides outside ibm.com) (PDF, 121 KB), generates a random subset of features, which ensures low correlation among decision trees. \n\nThis is a key difference between decision trees and random forests. \nWhile decision trees consider all the possible feature splits, random forests only select a subset of those features.\nIf we go back to the “should I surf?” example, the questions that I may ask to determine the prediction may not be as comprehensive as someone else’s set of questions. \n\nBy accounting for all the potential variability in the data, we can reduce the risk of overfitting, bias, and overall variance, resulting in more precise predictions.\n\n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-3">How it works</h3>\nRandom forest algorithms have three main hyperparameters, which need to be set before training. \nThese include node size, the number of trees, and the number of features sampled. \nFrom there, the random forest classifier can be used to solve for regression or classification problems.\n\nThe random forest algorithm is made up of a collection of decision trees, and each tree in the ensemble is comprised of a data sample drawn from a training set with replacement, called the bootstrap sample. \nOf that training sample, one-third of it is set aside as test data, known as the out-of-bag (oob) sample, which we’ll come back to later. \nAnother instance of randomness is then injected through feature bagging, adding more diversity to the dataset and reducing the correlation among decision trees. \n\nDepending on the type of problem, the determination of the prediction will vary. \nFor a regression task, the individual decision trees will be averaged, and for a classification task, a majority vote—i.e. the most frequent categorical variable—will yield the predicted class. \n\nFinally, the oob sample is then used for cross-validation, finalizing that prediction.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/cdp/cf/ul/g/50/f9/ICLH_Diagram_Batch_03_27-RandomForest.component.l.ts=1679336476850.png/content/adobe-cms/us/en/WhatisRFtopics/random-forest/jcr:content/root/table_of_contents/body/simple_narrative/image">\n\n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-4">Benefits and challenges of random forest</h3>\nThere are a number of key advantages and challenges that the random forest algorithm presents when used for classification or regression problems. \n\nSome of them include:\n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-5">Key Benefits</h3>\nReduced risk of overfitting: Decision trees run the risk of overfitting as they tend to tightly fit all the samples within training data. \n\nHowever, when there’s a robust number of decision trees in a random forest, the classifier won’t overfit the model since the averaging of uncorrelated trees lowers the overall variance and prediction error.\nProvides flexibility: Since random forest can handle both regression and classification tasks with a high degree of accuracy, it is a popular method among data scientists. \nFeature bagging also makes the random forest classifier an effective tool for estimating missing values as it maintains accuracy when a portion of the data is missing.\n\nEasy to determine feature importance: Random forest makes it easy to evaluate variable importance, or contribution, to the model. \nThere are a few ways to evaluate feature importance. \nGini importance and mean decrease in impurity (MDI) are usually used to measure how much the model’s accuracy decreases when a given variable is excluded. \n\nHowever, permutation importance, also known as mean decrease accuracy (MDA), is another importance measure. \nMDA identifies the average decrease in accuracy by randomly permutating the feature values in oob samples.\n<h3 id="WhatisRFtopic-6">Key Challenges</h3>\nTime-consuming process: Since random forest algorithms can handle large data sets, they can be provide more accurate predictions, but can be slow to process data as they are computing data for each individual decision tree.\nRequires more resources: Since random forests process larger data sets, they’ll require more resources to store that data.\nMore complex: The prediction of a single decision tree is easier to interpret when compared to a forest of them.\n\nRandom forest applications\nThe random forest algorithm has been applied across a number of industries, allowing them to make better business decisions. \nSome use cases include:\n\nFinance: It is a preferred algorithm over others as it reduces time spent on data management and pre-processing tasks. \nIt can be used to evaluate customers with high credit risk, to detect fraud, and option pricing problems.\nHealthcare: The random forest algorithm has applications within <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~qyj/papersA08/11-rfbook.pdf">computational biology</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) (PDF, 737 KB), allowing doctors to tackle problems such as gene expression classification, biomarker discovery, and sequence annotation. \n\nAs a result, doctors can make estimates around drug responses to specific medications.\nE-commerce: It can be used for recommendation engines for cross-sell purposes.\n',

Forest Algorithm?</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nRandom Forest is one of the most popular and commonly used algorithms by Data Scientists. \n\nRandom forest is a <k>Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm</k>that is <k>used widely in Classification and Regression problems</k>. \nIt builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.\nOne of the most important features of the Random Forest Algorithm is that it can handle the data set containing <k>continuous variables,</k>as in the case of regression, and <k>categorical variables,</k>as in the case of classification. \n\nIt performs better for classification and regression tasks. \nIn this tutorial, we will understand the working of random forest and implement random forest on a classification task.\n\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-1">Real-Life Analogy of Random Forest</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nLet’s dive into a real-life analogy to understand this concept further. \nA student named X wants to choose a course after his 10+2, and he is confused about the choice of course based on his skill set. \n\nSo he decides to consult various people like his cousins, teachers, parents, degree students, and working people. \nHe asks them varied questions like why he should choose, job opportunities with that course, course fee, etc. \nFinally, after consulting various people about the course he decides to take the course suggested by most people.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/r1.png">\n\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-2">Working of Random Forest Algorithm</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nBefore understanding the working of the random forest algorithm in machine learning, we must look into the ensemble learning technique. \n <k>Ensemble </k>simplymeans combining multiple models. \nThus a collection of models is used to make predictions rather than an individual model.\n\nEnsemble uses two types of methods:\n1. <k>Bagging</k>– It creates a different training subset from sample training data with replacement & the final output is based on majority voting. \n\nFor example, Random Forest.\n2. <k>Boosting</k>– It combines weak learners into strong learners by creating sequential models such that the final model has the highest accuracy. \n\nFor example, ADA BOOST, XG BOOST.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/4661536426211ba43ea612c8e1a6a1ed4550721164.png">\nAs mentioned earlier, Random forest works on the Bagging principle. \n\nNow let’sdive in and understand bagging in detail.\n<h4>Bagging</h4>\nBagging, also known as <k>Bootstrap Aggregation,</k> is the ensemble technique used by random forest.Bagging chooses a random sample/random subset from the entire data set. \n\nHence each model is generated from the samples (Bootstrap Samples) provided by the Original Data with replacement known as <k>row sampling</k>. \nThis step of row sampling with replacement is called <k> bootstrap</k>. \nNow each model is trained independently, which generates results. \n\nThe final output is based on majority voting after combining the results of all models. \nThis step which involves combining all the results and generating output based on majority voting, is known as <k>aggregation</k>.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/77772440px-Ensemble_Bagging66584.png">\n\nNow let’s look at an example by breaking it down with the help of the following figure. \nHere the bootstrap sample is taken from actual data (Bootstrap sample 01, Bootstrap sample 02, and Bootstrap sample 03) with a replacement which means there is a high possibility that each sample won’t contain unique data. \nThe model (Model 01, Model 02, and Model 03) obtained from this bootstrap sample is trained independently. \n\nEach model generates results as shown. \nNow the Happy emoji has a majority when compared to the Sad emoji. \nThus based on majority voting final output is obtained as Happy emoji.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/325745-Bagging-ensemble-method78495.png">\n<h4>Boosting</h4>\nBoosting is one of the techniques that use the concept of ensemble learning. \n\nA boosting algorithm combines multiple simple models (also known as weak learners or base estimators) to generate the final output. \nIt is done by building a model by using weak models in series.\nThere are several boosting algorithms; AdaBoost was the first really successful boosting algorithm that was developed for the purpose of binary classification. \n\nAdaBoost is an abbreviation for Adaptive Boosting and is a prevalent boosting technique that combines multiple “weak classifiers” into a single “strong classifier.” There are Other Boosting techniques. \nFor more, you can visit\n4 Boosting Algorithms You Should Know – GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM & CatBoost\n\n<h4>Steps Involved in Random Forest Algorithm</h4>\n<u>Step 1</u>: In the Random forest model, a subset of data points and a subset of features is selected for constructing each decision tree. \nSimply put, n random records and m features are taken from the data set having k number of records.\n\n<u>Step 2</u>: Individual decision trees are constructed for each sample.\n<u>Step 3</u>: Each decision tree will generate an output.\n<u>Step 4</u>: Final output is considered based on <k>Majority Voting or Averaging </k>for Classification and regression, respectively.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/24015Random+Forest64097.png">\nFor example: consider the fruit basket as the data as shown in the figure below. \nNow n number of samples are taken from the fruit basket, and an individual decision tree is constructed for each sample. \n\nEach decision tree will generate an output, as shown in the figure. \nThe final output is considered based on majority voting. \nIn the below figure, you can see that the majority decision tree gives output as an apple when compared to a banana, so the final output is taken as an apple.\n\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/33019random-forest-algorithm287548.png">\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-3">Important Features of Random Forest</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\n <k>Diversity: </k>Not all attributes/variables/features are considered while making an individual tree; each tree is different.\n\n <k>Immune to the curse of dimensionality:</k> Since each tree does not consider all the features, the feature space is reduced.\n\n <k>Parallelization: </k>Each tree is created independently out of different data and attributes. \n\nThis means we can fully use the CPU to build random forests.\n\n <k>Train-Test split: </k>In a random forest, we don’t have to segregate the data for train and test as there will always be 30% of the data which is not seen by the decision tree.\n\n <k>Stability: </k>Stability arises because the result is based on majority voting/ averaging.\n\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-4">Difference Between DecisionTree and Random Forest</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nRandom forest is a collection of decision trees; still, there are a lot of differences in their behavior.\n\n <k>Decision trees Random Forest</k>1. Decision trees normally suffer from the problem of overfitting if it’s allowed to grow without any control.1. Random forests are created from subsets of data, and the final output is based on average or majority ranking; hence the problem of overfitting is taken care of.2. A single decision tree is faster in computation.2. It is comparatively slower.3. When a data set with features is taken as input by a decision tree, it will formulate some rules to make predictions.3. Random forest randomly selects observations, builds a decision tree, and takes the average result. \nIt doesn’t use any set of formulas.\nThus random forests are much more successful than decision trees only if the trees are diverse and acceptable.\n\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-5">Important Hyperparameters in Random Forest</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nHyperparameters are used in random forests to either enhance the performance and predictive power of models or to make the model faster.\n<h4>Hyperparameters to Increase the Predictive Power</h4>\n\n <k>n_estimators:</k> Number of trees the algorithm builds before averaging the predictions.\n <k>max_features:</k> Maximum number of features random forest considers splitting a node.\n <k>mini_sample_leaf:</k> Determines the minimum number of leaves required to split an internal node.\n\n <k>criterion:</k> How to split the node in each tree?

It is immune to the curse of dimensionality. \nSince each tree does not consider all the attributes, feature space is reduced.\n8. We don’t have to segregate data into train and test as there will always be 30% of the data, which is not seen by the decision tree made out of bootstrap.\n\n<h4>Disadvantages</h4>\n1. Random forest is highly complex compared to decision trees, where decisions can be made by following the path of the tree.\n2. Training time is more than other models due to its complexity. \nWhenever it has to make a prediction, each decision tree has to generate output for the given input data.\n\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-9">Conclusion</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nRandom forest is a great choice if anyone wants to build the model fast and efficiently, as one of the best things about the random forest is it can handle missing values. \nIt is one of the best techniques with high performance, widely used in various industries for its efficiency. \nIt can handle binary, continuous, and categorical data. \nOverall, random forest is a fast, simple, flexible, and robust model with some limitations.\n\n <k>Key Takeaways</k>\nRandom forest algorithm is an ensemble learning technique combining numerous classifiers to enhance a model’s performance.\nRandom Forest is a supervised machine-learning algorithm made up of decision trees.\nRandom Forest is used for both classification and regression problems.\n\n<h3 id="UnderstandRFtopic-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\n <k>Q1. How do you explain a random forest?</k> A. \n\nRandom Forest is a supervised learning algorithm that works on the concept of bagging. \nIn bagging, a group of models is trained on different subsets of the dataset, and the final output is generated by collating the outputs of all the different models. \nIn the case of random forest, the base model is a decision tree.  <k>Q2. How random forest works step by step?</k> A. \nThe following steps will tell you how random forest works:1. <k>Create Bootstrap Samples</k>: Construct different samples of the dataset with replacements by randomly selecting the rows and columns from the dataset. \n\nThese are known as bootstrap samples.2. <k>Build Decision Trees</k>: Construct the decision tree on each bootstrap sample as per the hyperparameters.3. <k>Generate Final Output</k>: Combine the output of all the decision trees to generate the final output.  <k>Q3. What are the advantages of Random Forest?</k> A. \nRandom Forest tends to have a low bias since it works on the concept of bagging. \nIt works well even with a dataset with a large no. \n\nof features since it works on a subset of features. \nMoreover, it is faster to train as the trees are independent of each other, making the training process parallelizable.  <k> <k>Q4. Why do we use random forest algorithms?</k></k> A. \n\nRandom Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks due to its high accuracy, robustness, feature importance, versatility, and scalability. \nRandom Forest reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees and is less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. \nIt provides a measure of feature importance, which can be useful for feature selection and data interpretation.  \n',

Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that grows multiple decision tress and complies their results them into one. \nIt is an ensemble technique made using multiple decision models. \nThe ensemble technique uses multiple machine learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance. \n\nRandom forest selects random parameters for the decision making i.e its adds additional randomness to the model, while growing the trees. \nThis leads to searching for the best feature among a random subset of feature which results in a wide diversity that generally results in a better model. \nThis recipe demonstrates an example on performing Random Forest in R.\n\n<h3 id="performRFtopic-0">Install required packages</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\ninstall.packages("dplyr")\nlibrary("dplyr")\n\ninstall.packages("caTools")    # For Logistic regression \nlibrary(caTools)\n\ninstall.packages(\'randomForest\') # For generating random forest model\nlibrary(randomForest)\n\ninstall.packages(\'caret\')                    # \n# classification and regression training : The library caret has a function to make prediction.\n\nlibrary(caret)\ninstall.packages(\'e1071\', dependencies=TRUE)\n\n<h3 id="performRFtopic-1">Read the dataset</h3>\nA dataset on heart disease is taken (classification problem), were predictions are to be made whether a patient has heart disease or not. \nThe target variable is y : \'target\'. \nclass 0 : patient does not have heart disease\nclass 1 : patient does not have heart disease\n\n<h3 id="performRFtopic-2">Dataset Description</h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nage: age in years\nsex: sex (1 = male;

id="RandomForestTuttopic-0"><span class="orange">What is Random Forest in R?</span></h3>\nRandom forests are based on a simple idea: \'the wisdom of the crowd\'.\nAggregate of the results of multiple predictors gives a better prediction than the best individual predictor.\nA group of predictors is called an <k>ensemble</k>.\nThus, this technique is called <k>Ensemble Learning</k>.\n\nIn earlier tutorial, you learned how to use <k>Decision trees</k> to make a binary prediction.\nTo improve our technique, we can train a group of <k>Decision Tree classifiers</k>, each on a different random subset of the train set.\nTo make a prediction, we just obtain the predictions of all individuals trees, then predict the class that gets the most votes.\nThis technique is called <k>Random Forest</k>.\n\n<h3 id="RandomForestTuttopic-1"><span class="orange"><k>Step 1)</k> Import the data</span></h3>\nTo make sure you have the same dataset as in the tutorial for decision trees, the train test and test set are stored on the internet.\nYou can import them without make any change.\n\n<small>library(dplyr)\ndata_train = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming/master/train.csv")\nglimpse(data_train)\ndata_test = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming/master/test.csv") \nglimpse(data_test)\n</small>\n<h3 id="RandomForestTuttopic-2"><span class="orange"><k>Step 2) </k>Train the model</span></h3>\nOne way to evaluate the performance of a model is to train it on a number of different smaller datasets and evaluate them over the other smaller testing set.\nThis is called the <k>F-fold cross-validation</k> feature.\nR has a function to randomly split  number of datasets of almost the same size.\nFor example, if k=9, the model is evaluated over the nine folder and tested on the remaining test set.\nThis process is repeated until all the subsets have been evaluated.\nThis technique is widely used for model selection, especially when the model has parameters to tune.\n\nNow that we have a way to evaluate our model, we need to figure out how to choose the parameters that generalized best the data.\n\nRandom forest chooses a random subset of features and builds many Decision Trees.\nThe model averages out all the predictions of the Decisions trees.\n\nRandom forest has some parameters that can be changed to improve the generalization of the prediction.\nYou will use the function RandomForest() to train the model.\n\nSyntax for Randon Forest is\n\nRandomForest(formula, ntree=n, mtry=FALSE, maxnodes = NULL)\nArguments:\n- Formula: Formula of the fitted model\n- ntree: number of trees in the forest\n- mtry: Number of candidates draw to feed the algorithm.\nBy default, it is the square of the number of columns.\n- maxnodes: Set the maximum amount of terminal nodes in the forest\n- importance=TRUE: Whether independent variables importance in the random forest be assessed\n\n<k>Note</k>: Random forest can be trained on more parameters.\nYou can refer to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf" data-lasso-id="209881">vignette</a> to see the different parameters.\n\nTuning a model is very tedious work.\nThere are lot of combination possible between the parameters.\nYou don\'t necessarily have the time to try all of them.\nA good alternative is to let the machine find the best combination for you.\nThere are two methods available:\n\n<k>Random Search\nGrid Search</k>\n\nWe will define both methods but during the tutorial, we will train the model using grid search\n\n<h3 id="RandomForestTuttopic-3">Grid Search definition</h3>\nThe grid search method is simple, the model will be evaluated over all the combination you pass in the function, using cross-validation.\n\nFor instance, you want to try the model with 10, 20, 30 number of trees and each tree will be tested over a number of mtry equals to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nThen the machine will test 15 different models:\n<small>\n    .mtry ntrees\n 1      1     10\n 2      2     10\n 3      3     10\n 4      4     10\n 5      5     10\n 6      1     20\n 7      2     20\n 8      3     20\n 9      4     20\n 10     5     20\n 11     1     30\n 12     2     30\n 13     3     30\n 14     4     30\n 15     5     30	\n</small>\nThe algorithm will evaluate:\n<small>\nRandomForest(formula, ntree=10, mtry=1)\nRandomForest(formula, ntree=10, mtry=2)\nRandomForest(formula, ntree=10, mtry=3)\nRandomForest(formula, ntree=20, mtry=2)\n...\n</small>\nEach time, the random forest experiments with a cross-validation.\nOne shortcoming of the grid search is the number of experimentations.\nIt can become very easily explosive when the number of combination is high.\nTo overcome this issue, you can use the random search\n\n<h3 id="RandomForestTuttopic-4">Random Search definition</h3>\nThe big difference between random search and grid search is, random search will not evaluate all the combination of hyperparameter in the searching space.\nInstead, it will randomly choose combination at every iteration.\nThe advantage is it lower the computational cost.\n\n<h3 id="RandomForestTuttopic-5">Set the control parameter</h3>\nYou will proceed as follow to construct and evaluate the model:\n<ul><li>Evaluate the model with the default setting</li>\n<li>Find the best number of mtry</li>\n<li>Find the best number of maxnodes</li>\n<li>Find the best number of ntrees</li>\n<li>Evaluate the model on the test dataset</li>\n</ul>\nBefore you begin with the parameters exploration, you need to install two libraries.\n\n<ul><li>caret: R machine learning library.\nIf you have install R with r-essential.\nIt is already in the library\n<ul><li><a href="https://anaconda.org/r/r-caret" data-lasso-id="209882">Anaconda</a>: conda install -c r r-caret</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>e1071: R machine learning library.\n<ul><li><a href="https://anaconda.org/r/r-caret" data-lasso-id="209883">Anaconda</a>: conda install -c r r-e1071</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\nYou can import them along with RandomForest\n<small>\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(e1071)\n</small>\n<h3 id="RandomForestTuttopic-6">Default setting</h3>\nK-fold cross validation is controlled by the trainControl() function\n<small>\ntrainControl(method = "cv", number = n, search ="grid")\narguments\n- method = "cv": The method used to resample the dataset.\n\n- number = n: Number of folders to create\n- search = "grid": Use the search grid method.</small>\nFor randomized method, use "grid"\nNote: You can refer to the vignette to see the other arguments of the function.\n\nYou can try to run the model with the default parameters and see the accuracy score.\n\n<k>Note</k>: You will use the same controls during all the tutorial.\n<small>\n# Define the control\ntrControl = trainControl(method = "cv",\n    number = 10,\n    search = "grid")\n</small>\nYou will use caret library to evaluate your model.\nThe library has one function called train() to evaluate almost all machine learning algorithm.\nSay differently, you can use this function to train other algorithms.\n\nThe basic syntax is:\n<small>\ntrain(formula, df, method = "rf", metric= "Accuracy", trControl = trainControl(), tuneGrid = NULL)\nargument\n- \nformula\n: Define the formula of the algorithm\n- \nmethod\n: Define which model to train.\nNote, at the end of the tutorial, there is a list of all the models that can be trained\n- \nmetric\n = "Accuracy": Define how to select the optimal model\n- \ntrControl = trainControl()\n: Define the control parameters\n- \ntuneGrid = NULL\n: Return a data frame with all the possible combination\n</small>\nLet\'s try the build the model with the default values.\n<small>\nset.seed(1234)\n# Run the model\nrf_default = train(survived~.,\n    data = data_train,\n    method = "rf",\n    metric = "Accuracy",\n    trControl = trControl)\n# Print the results\nprint(rf_default)\n</small>\n<r>Code Explanation</r>\n<ul><li>trainControl(method=”cv”, number=10, search=”grid”): Evaluate the model with a grid search of 10 folder</li>\n<li>train(…): Train a random forest model.\nBest model is chosen with the accuracy measure.</li>\n</ul>\n<k>Output:</k>\n\n## Random Forest \n## \n## 836 samples\n##   7 predictor\n##   2 classes: \'No\', \'Yes\' \n## \n## No pre-processing\n## Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold)

train the model on the train set and test the prediction on the test set (i.e. unseen data)</li>\n<li>Install rpart.plot from the console</li>\n</ul>\nThe common practice is to split the data 80/20, 80 percent of the data serves to train the model, and 20 percent to make predictions.\nYou need to create two separate data frames.\nYou don’t want to touch the test set until you finish building your model.\nYou can create a function name create_train_test() that takes three arguments.\n<mm>create_train_test(df, size = 0.8, train = TRUE)</mm>\narguments:\n-df: Dataset used to train the model.\n-size: Size of the split.\nBy default, 0.8.\nNumerical value\n-train: If set to \nTRUE\n, the function creates the train set, otherwise the test set.\nDefault value sets to \nTRUE\n.\nBoolean value.You need to add a Boolean parameter because R does not allow to return two data frames simultaneously.\n<mm>create_train_test = function(data, size = 0.8, train = TRUE) {\n    n_row = nrow(data)\n    total_row = size * n_row\n    train_sample = 1:total_row\n    if (train == TRUE) {\n        return (data[train_sample, ])\n    } else {\n        return (data[-train_sample, ])\n

survivors is the same, about 40 percent.\n<h3 id="DecisionTreetopic-5">Install rpart.plot</h3>\nrpart.plot is not available from conda libraries.\nYou can install it from the console:\ninstall.packages("rpart.plot")\n<h3 id="DecisionTreetopic-6"><span class="orange"><k>Step 4) </k>Build the model</span></h3>\nYou are ready to build the model.\nThe syntax for Rpart decision tree function is:\nrpart(formula, data=, method=\'\')\narguments:			\n- formula: The function to predict\n- data: Specifies the data frame- method: 			\n- "class" for a classification tree 			\n- "anova" for a regression tree	\n\nYou use the class method because you predict a class.\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\nfit = rpart(survived~., data = data_train, method = \'class\')\nrpart.plot(fit, extra = 106\n<r>Code Explanation</r>\n<ul><li>rpart(): Function to fit the model.\nThe arguments are:\n<ul><li>survived ~.: Formula of the Decision Trees</li>\n<li>data = data_train: Dataset</li>\n<li>method = ‘class’: Fit a binary model</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>rpart.plot(fit, extra= 106): Plot the tree.\nThe extra features are set to 101 to display the probability of the 2nd class (useful for binary responses).\nYou can refer to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart.plot/rpart.plot.pdf" data-lasso-id="209458">vignette</a> for more information

at the root node (depth 0 over 3, the top of the graph):\n<ol>\n<li>At the top, it is the overall probability of survival.\nIt shows the proportion of passenger that survived the crash.\n41 percent of passenger survived.</li>\n<li>This node asks whether the gender of the passenger is male.\nIf yes, then you go down to the root’s left child node (depth 2).\n63 percent are males with a survival probability of 21 percent.</li>\n<li>In the second node, you ask if the male passenger is above 3.5 years old.\nIf yes, then the chance of survival is 19 percent.</li>\n<li>You keep on going like that to understand what features impact the likelihood of survival.</li>\n</ol>\nNote that, one of the many qualities of Decision Trees is that they require very little data preparation.\nIn particular, they don’t require feature scaling or centering.\nBy default, rpart() function uses the <k>Gini</k> impurity measure to split the note.\nThe higher the Gini coefficient, the more different instances within the node.\n<h3 id="DecisionTreetopic-7"><span class="orange"><k>Step 5)</k> Make a prediction</span></h3>\nYou can predict your test dataset.\nTo make a prediction, you can use the predict() function.\nThe basic syntax of predict for R decision tree is:\npredict(fitted_model, df, type = \'class\')\narguments:\n- fitted_model: This is the object stored after model estimation.\n\n- df: Data frame used to make the prediction\n- type: Type of prediction			\n    - \'class\': for classification			\n    - \'prob\': to compute the probability of each class			\n    - \'vector\': Predict the mean response at the node level	\n\nYou want to predict which passengers are more likely to survive after the collision from the test set.\nIt means, you will know among those 209 passengers, which one will survive or not.\npredict_unseen =predict(fit, data_test, type = \'class\')\n<r>Code Explanation</r>\n<ul><li>predict(fit, data_test, type = ‘class’): Predict the class (0/1) of the test set</li>\n</ul>\nTesting the passenger who didn’t make it and those who did.\ntable_mat = table(data_test<k>$</k>survived, predict_unseen)\ntable_mat\n<r>Code Explanation</r>\n<ul><li>table(data_test$survived, predict_unseen): Create a  table to count how many passengers are classified as survivors and passed away compare to the correct decision tree classification in R</li>\n</ul>\n<span class="smallsize"><k>Output:</k>\n##      predict_unseen\n##        No Yes\n##   No  106  15\n##   Yes  30  58\n</span>\nThe model correctly predicted 106 dead passengers but classified 15 survivors as dead.\nBy analogy, the model misclassified 30 passengers as survivors while they turned out to be dead.\n<h3 id="DecisionTreetopic-8"><span class="orange"><k>Step 6)</k> Measure performance</span></h3>\nYou can compute an accuracy measure for classification task with the <k><a href="/confusion-matrix-machine-learning-example.html" data-lasso-id="209461">confusion matrix</a></k>:\nThe <k>confusion matrix</k> is a better choice to evaluate the classification performance.\nThe general idea is to count the number of times True instances are classified are False.\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.guru99.com/images/r_programming/032918_0938_DecisionTre2.png">\nEach row in a confusion matrix represents an actual target, while each column represents a predicted target.\nThe first row of this matrix considers dead passengers (the False class): 106 were correctly classified as dead (<k>True negative</k>), while the remaining one was wrongly classified as a survivor (<k>False positive</k>).\nThe second row considers the survivors, the positive class were 58 (<k>True positive</k>), while the <k>True negative</k> was 30.\nYou can compute the <k>accuracy test</k> from the confusion matrix:\n<img class="lazy" data-src="https://www.guru99.com/images/r_programming/032918_0938_DecisionTre3.jpg">\nIt is the proportion of true positive and true negative over the sum of the matrix.\nWith R, you can code as follow:\naccuracy_Test = sum(diag(table_mat)) / sum(table_mat)\n<r>Code Explanation</r>\n<ul><li>sum(diag(table_mat)): Sum of the diagonal</li>\n<li>sum(table_mat): Sum of the matrix.</li>\n</ul>\nYou can print the accuracy of the test set:\nprint(paste(\'Accuracy for test\', accuracy_Test))\n<span class="smallsize"><k>Output:</k>\n## [1] "Accuracy for test 0.784688995215311"</span>\nYou have a score of 78 percent for the test set.\nYou can replicate the same exercise with the training dataset.\n<h3 id="DecisionTreetopic-9"><span class="orange"><k>Step 7) </k>Tune the hyper-parameters</span></h3>\nDecision tree in R has various parameters that control aspects of the fit.\nIn rpart decision tree library, you can control the parameters using the rpart.control() function.\nIn the following code, you introduce the parameters you will tune.\nYou can refer to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/rpart.pdf" data-lasso-id="209463">vignette</a> for other parameters.\nrpart.control(minsplit = 20, minbucket = round(minsplit/3), maxdepth = 30)\nArguments:\n-minsplit: Set the minimum number of observations in the node before the algorithm perform a split\n-minbucket:  Set the minimum number of observations in the final note i.e. the leaf\n-maxdepth: Set the maximum depth of any node of the final tree.\nThe root node is treated a depth 0\nWe will proceed as follow:\n<ul><li>Construct function to return accuracy</li>\n<li>Tune the maximum depth</li>\n<li>Tune the minimum number of sample a node must have before it can split</li>\n<li>Tune the minimum number of sample a leaf node must have</li>\n</ul>\nYou can write a function to display the accuracy.\nYou simply wrap the code you used before:\n<ol>\n<li>predict: predict_unseen = predict(fit, data_test, type = ‘class’)</li>\n<li>Produce table: table_mat = table(data_test$survived, predict_unseen)</li>\n<li>Compute accuracy: accuracy_Test = sum(diag(table_mat))/sum(table_mat)</li>\n</ol>\naccuracy_tune = function(fit) {\n    predict_unseen = predict(fit, data_test, type = \'class\')\n    table_mat = table(data_test$survived, predict_unseen)\n    accuracy_Test = sum(diag(table_mat)) / sum(table_mat)\n    accuracy_Test\n}\n\nYou can try to tune the parameters and see if you can improve the model over the default value.\nAs a reminder, you need to get an accuracy higher than 0.78\ncontrol = rpart.control(minsplit = 4,\n    minbucket = round(5 / 3),\n    maxdepth = 3,\n    cp = 0)\ntune_fit = rpart(survived~., data = data_train, method = \'class\', control = control)\naccuracy_tune(tune_fit)\n<span class="smallsize"><k>Output:</k>\n## [1] 0.7990431</span>\nWith the following parameter:\nminsplit = 4\nminbucket= round(5/3)\nmaxdepth = 3cp=0\nYou get a higher performance than the previous model.\nCongratulation!\n<h3 id="DecisionTreetopic-10">Summary</h3>\nWe can summarize the functions to train a decision tree algorithm in

'<h2>Random Forest with Key Predictors</h2>\nThe process of using <mm>randomForest</mm> package to build an RF model is the same as the decision tree package <mm>rpart</mm>.

For categorical predictors, the imputed value is\n  the category with the largest average proximity. This process is iterated iter times.\n  Note: Imputation has not (yet) been implemented for the unsupervised case.

'<h2>R programs to communicate with another R program</h2>\nTo communicate between independent R programs, you can make use of interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms. \nThere are several approaches you can take to achieve this. \n\nHere are a few common methods:\nTCP/IP Socket Communication:\nYou can establish a client-server architecture using TCP/IP sockets. \nOne R program can act as a server, listening for incoming connections, while the other R program can act as a client, initiating a connection to the server. \n\nThe two programs can then exchange data through the socket connection.\n\nNamed Pipes:\nNamed pipes provide a way for processes to communicate with each other using a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer. \nOne R program can write data to the named pipe, while the other R program can read from it. \n\nThis allows for bidirectional communication between the programs.\n\nShared Memory:\nShared memory allows multiple processes to access and modify the same memory space. \nYou can use the R.utils package in R to create shared memory objects that can be accessed by multiple R programs. \n\nThis way, you can share data between the programs without the need for explicit communication.\n\nRserve:\nRserve is a TCP/IP server that allows other programs to connect to R and execute R functions remotely. \nYou can run an Rserve instance as a separate process, and the other R programs can connect to it to interact with R. \n\nThis approach is particularly useful if you want to execute specific R functions in the remote program.\n\nMessaging Systems:\nYou can use messaging systems like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ to facilitate communication between R programs. \nThese systems provide a publish-subscribe or message queue model, allowing programs to send messages to specific topics or queues. \n\nR programs can act as producers or consumers of messages, enabling communication between them.\nWhen implementing communication between independent R programs, it\'s important to ensure that both programs are running concurrently and can establish communication channels. \nYou can leverage relevant packages or libraries in R that facilitate the chosen method of communication.\n\nHere\'s an example of how you can use TCP/IP socket communication in R to establish communication between two independent R programs: one acting as a client and the other as a server.\n\n<k>Server R Program:</k>\n# Server program\nlibrary(sock)\n \n# Create a TCP/IP server socket\nserver <- socketCreate(type = "tcp")\n\n# Bind and listen on a specific port\nsocketBind(server, port = 12345)\nsocketListen(server)\n\n# Accept incoming connections from clients\nclient <- socketAccept(server)\n\n# Read data from the client\ndata <- socketRead(client)\n\n# Process the received data\nprocessedData <- toupper(data)\n\n# Send the processed data back to the client\nsocketWrite(client, processedData)\n\n# Close the client and server sockets\nsocketClose(client)\nsocketClose(server)\n\n<k>Client R Program:</k>\n# Client program\n\nlibrary(sock)\n# Create a TCP/IP client socket\nclient <- socketCreate(type = "tcp")\n\n# Connect to the server\nsocketConnect(client, host = "localhost", port = 12345)\n\n# Send data to the server\ndata <- "Hello, server!"\nsocketWrite(client, data)\n\n# Read the processed data from the server\nprocessedData <- socketRead(client)\n\n# Print the processed data\ncat("Received from server:", processedData, "/n")\n\n# Close the client socket\nsocketClose(client)\n\nIn this example, the server program creates a TCP/IP server socket, binds it to a specific port (in this case, 12345), and listens for incoming connections using socketCreate, socketBind, and socketListen.\nThe socketAccept function accepts an incoming connection from a client, and then socketRead reads the data sent by the client.\n\nThe server program processes the received data (in this case, converting it to uppercase) and sends the processed data back to the client using socketWrite.\n\nThe client program creates a TCP/IP client socket using socketCreate and connects to the server using socketConnect, specifying the server\'s host and port.\nThe client program then sends data to the server using socketWrite and reads the processed data from the server using socketRead.\nFinally, it prints the received data.\n\nRemember to run the server program first, followed by the client program.\nYou can modify the code to fit your specific needs, such as handling more complex data or performing additional operations.\n\n用R语言来读取日期和时间\n可以使用内置的文件操作功能和日期时间处理函数。\n\n# 读取闹钟日期和时间的文本文件路径\nfile_path <- "path/to/alarms.txt"\n\n# 存储闹钟日期和时间的向量\nalarms <- character()\n\n# 打开文本文件并读取闹钟日期和时间\ncon <- file(file_path, "r")\nwhile (length(line <- readLines(con, n = 1)) > 0) {\n  alarms <- c(alarms, line)\n}\nclose(con)\n\n# 处理每个闹钟\nfor (alarm in alarms) {\n  #

Scale each of the variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix for the scaled variables.\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n\nUsing linear algebra, it can be shown that the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue is the first principal component. In other words, this particular combination of the predictors explains the most variance in the data.\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue is the second principal component, and so on.\n\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step example of how to perform this process in R.\n\n<h3 id="PCAExampletopic-0"><pk>Step 1: Load the Data</pk></h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nFirst we’ll load the <pk>tidyverse</pk> package, which contains several useful functions for visualizing and manipulating data:\n\n<pk>library(tidyverse)</pk>\nFor this example we’ll use the USArrests dataset built into R, which contains the number of arrests per 100,000 residents in each U.S. state in 1973 for Murder, Assault, and Rape.\n\nIt also includes the percentage of the population in each state living in urban areas, UrbanPop.\n\nThe following code show how to load and view the first few rows of the dataset:\n\n#load data\ndata("USArrests")\n\n#view first six rows of data\nhead(USArrests)\n\n           Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape\nAlabama      13.2     236       58 21.2\nAlaska       10.0     263       48 44.5\nArizona       8.1     294       80 31.0\nArkansas      8.8     190       50 19.5\nCalifornia    9.0     276       91 40.6\nColorado      7.9     204       78 38.7\n\n<h3 id="PCAExampletopic-1"><pk>Step 2: Calculate the Principal Components</pk></h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nAfter loading the data, we can use the R built-in function <pk>prcomp()</pk> to calculate the principal components of the dataset.\n\nBe sure to specify <pk>scale = TRUE</pk> so that each of the variables in the dataset are scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before calculating the principal components.\n\nAlso note that eigenvectors in R point in the negative direction by default, so we’ll multiply by -1 to reverse the signs.\n\n<pk>#calculate principal components\nresults &lt;- prcomp(USArrests, scale = TRUE)\n\n#reverse the signs\nresults$rotation &lt;- -1*results$rotation\n\n#display principal components\nresults$rotation\n\n               PC1        PC2        PC3         PC4\nMurder   0.5358995 -0.4181809  0.3412327 -0.64922780\nAssault  0.5831836 -0.1879856  0.2681484  0.74340748\nUrbanPop 0.2781909  0.8728062  0.3780158 -0.13387773\nRape     0.5434321  0.1673186 -0.8177779 -0.08902432</pk>\nWe can see that the first principal component (PC1) has high values for Murder, Assault, and Rape which indicates that this principal component describes the most variation in these variables.\n\nWe can also see that the second principal component (PC2) has a high value for UrbanPop, which indicates that this principle component places most of its emphasis on urban population.\n\nNote that the principal components scores for each state are stored in <pk>results$x</pk>.

For example, Georgia is the state closest to the variable Murder in the plot.\n\nIf we take a look at the states with the highest murder rates in the original dataset, we can see that Georgia is actually at the top of the list:\n\n<pk>#display states with highest murder rates in original dataset\nhead(USArrests[order(-USArrests$Murder),])\n\n               Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape\nGeorgia          17.4     211       60 25.8\nMississippi      16.1     259       44 17.1\nFlorida          15.4     335       80 31.9\nLouisiana        15.4     249       66 22.2\nSouth Carolina   14.4     279       48 22.5\nAlabama          13.2     236       58 21.2</pk>\n<h3 id="PCAExampletopic-3"><pk>Step 4: Find Variance Explained by Each Principal Component</pk></h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nWe can use the following code to calculate the total variance in the original dataset explained by each principal component:\n\n<pk>#calculate total variance explained by each principal component\nresults$sdev^2 / sum(results$sdev^2)\n\n[1] 0.62006039 0.24744129 0.08914080 0.04335752\n</pk>\nFrom the results we can observe the following:\n\nThe first principal component explains <pk>62%</pk> of the total variance in the dataset.\n\nThe second principal component explains <pk>24.7%</pk> of the total variance in the dataset.\n\nThe third principal component explains <pk>8.9%</pk> of the total variance in the dataset.\n\nThe fourth principal component explains <pk>4.3%</pk> of the total variance in the dataset.\n\nThus, the first two principal components explain a majority of the total variance in the data.\n\nThis is a good sign because the previous biplot projected each of the observations from the original data onto a scatterplot that only took into account the first two principal components.\n\nThus, it’s valid to look at patterns in the biplot to identify states that are similar to each other.\n\nWe can also create a <pk>scree plot</pk> – a plot that displays the total variance explained by each principal component – to visualize the results of PCA:\n\n<pk>#calculate total variance explained by each principal component\nvar_explained = results$sdev^2 / sum(results$sdev^2)\n\n#create scree plot\nqplot(c(1:4), var_explained) + \n  geom_line() + \n  xlab("Principal Component") + \n  ylab("Variance Explained") +\n  ggtitle("Scree Plot") +\n  ylim(0, 1)</pk>\n\n<h3 id="PCAExampletopic-4"><pk>Principal Components Analysis in Practice</pk></h3><U+2003><a href="#top" target="_self"><b><U+21E7></b></a>\n\nIn practice, PCA is used most often for two reasons:\n\n<pk>1.

<gr>Clustered Heatmaps</gr></h3>\nClustered heatmaps extend the functionality of standard grid heatmaps by incorporating hierarchical clustering to show relationships between rows and columns.\nThis added dimension of information makes clustered heatmaps particularly valuable in fields like biology, where they are commonly used to visualize genetic data.\n\n<gr>Key Characteristics:</gr>\n<gr>Hierarchical Clustering</gr>: Clustered heatmaps use hierarchical clustering algorithms to group similar rows and columns together.\nThis clustering is often displayed as dendrograms (tree-like diagrams) alongside the heatmap, indicating the similarity between different rows or columns.\n<gr>Color Encoding</gr>: As with standard heatmaps, the cell color represents the value of the data point.\nThe color intensity or hue typically indicates the magnitude of the values, allowing for easy visual differentiation.\n<gr>Enhanced Patterns and Relationships</gr>: By clustering similar rows and columns together, clustered heatmaps make it easier to identify patterns, correlations, and relationships within the data.\nThis can reveal underlying structures that might not be immediately apparent in a standard heatmap.\n<gr>Interactive Exploration</gr>: Many software tools and libraries allow users to interact with clustered heatmaps, enabling them to zoom in on specific clusters, reorder rows and columns, and explore the data in greater detail.\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240612184116/Clustered-Heatmap.webp">\nClustered Heatmaps\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-6">Benefits of Heatmap Visualization</h3>\nHeatmaps offer several advantages over traditional data visualization methods:\n\n<gr>Intuitive Understanding</gr>: Colors make it easy to grasp complex data at a glance.\n<gr>Pattern Recognition</gr>: Heatmaps help identify patterns and trends that might be missed in numerical data.\n<gr>Engagement</gr>: The use of color makes heatmaps visually appealing and engaging.\n<gr>Granularity</gr>: Heatmaps provide detailed insights into data, allowing for more granular analysis.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-7">When to Use Heatmap Visualization</h3>\nHeatmaps are versatile and can be used in various scenarios:\n\n<gr>Website Optimization</gr>: To understand user behavior and optimize webpage design.\n<gr>Financial Analysis</gr>: To visualize performance metrics and identify areas needing improvement.\n<gr>Marketing</gr>: To track campaign performance and customer engagement.\n<gr>Scientific Research</gr>: To analyze genetic data and other complex datasets.\n<gr>Geographic Analysis</gr>: Visualizing spatial data such as population density, crime rates, or weather patterns.\n<gr>Sports Analytics</gr>: Analyzing player movements, game strategies, or performance metrics.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-8">Best Practices for Using Heatmaps for Data Visualization</h3>\nTo effectively use heatmaps, consider the following best practices:\n\n<gr>Choose the Right Color Scale</gr>: Selecting an appropriate color scale is crucial.\nSequential scales are ideal for data that progresses in one direction, while diverging scales are suitable for data with a central neutral point and values that can be both positive and negative.\n<gr>Ensure Sufficient Data: </gr>Heatmaps require a large amount of data to be accurate.\nAnalyzing heatmaps with insufficient data can lead to misleading conclusions.\n<gr>Combine with Other Analytics</gr>: Heatmaps should be used in conjunction with other analytics tools to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.\nFor example, combining heatmaps with form analytics can offer deeper insights into user behavior.\n<gr>Use Legends</gr>: Always include a legend to help interpret the color scale used in the heatmap.\nThis ensures that viewers can accurately understand the data being presented.\n<gr>Highlight Key Areas</gr>: Use heatmaps to draw attention to important areas of the data.\nFor example, in a website heatmap, highlight areas with the most user interaction to focus on optimizing those sections.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-9"><pk>Different Tools for Generating Heatmaps</pk></h3>\nWhen it comes to generating heatmaps, several tools stand out for their features, ease of use, and effectiveness.\nHere are some of the tools for generating heatmaps:\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-10"><U+2003><gr>Microsoft Clarity:</gr></h3>\nMicrosoft Clarity is a free tool that offers heatmaps along with session recordings and other analytics features.\nIt is designed to help users understand how visitors interact with their website and identify areas for improvement.\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-11"><U+2003><gr>Google Analytics (Page Analytics):</gr></h3>\nGoogle Analytics offers a heatmap feature through its Chrome extension, Page Analytics.\nThis tool provides a visual representation of where visitors click on a webpage, helping to identify popular and underperforming elements.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-12">Types of Data Visualization Techniques</h3>\n<gr>Bar Charts:</gr> Ideal for comparing categorical data or displaying frequencies, bar charts offer a clear visual representation of values.\n<gr>Line Charts:</gr> Perfect for illustrating trends over time, line charts connect data points to reveal patterns and fluctuations.\n<gr>Pie Charts:</gr> Efficient for displaying parts of a whole, pie charts offer a simple way to understand proportions and percentages.\n<gr>Scatter Plots:</gr> Showcase relationships between two variables, identifying patterns and outliers through scattered data points.\n<gr>Histograms:</gr> Depict the distribution of a continuous variable, providing insights into the underlying data patterns.\n<gr>Heatmaps:</gr> Visualize complex data sets through color-coding, emphasizing variations and correlations in a matrix.\n<gr>Box Plots:</gr> Unveil statistical summaries such as median, quartiles, and outliers, aiding in data distribution analysis.\n<gr>Area Charts:</gr> Similar to line charts but with the area under the line filled, these charts accentuate cumulative data patterns.\n<gr>Bubble Charts:</gr> Enhance scatter plots by introducing a third dimension through varying bubble sizes, revealing additional insights.\n<gr>Treemaps:</gr> Efficiently represent hierarchical data structures, breaking down categories into nested rectangles.\n<gr>Violin Plots</gr>: Violin plots combine aspects of box plots and kernel density plots, providing a detailed representation of the distribution of data. \n<gr>Word Clouds</gr>: Word clouds are visual representations of text data where words are sized based on their frequency.\n<gr>3D Surface Plots</gr>: 3D surface plots visualize three-dimensional data, illustrating how a response variable changes in relation to two predictor variables. \n<gr>Network Graphs</gr>: Network graphs represent relationships between entities using nodes and edges. They are useful for visualizing connections in complex systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, or organizational structures.\n<gr>Sankey Diagrams</gr>: Sankey diagrams visualize flow and quantity relationships between multiple entities. Often used in process engineering or energy flow analysis.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-13"><pk>R Heatmap Static and Interactive Visualization </pk></h3>\nhttps://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/heatmap-in-r-static-and-interactive-visualization/\n\nA <gr>heatmap</gr> (or <gr>heat map</gr>) is another way to visualize hierarchical clustering.\nIt’s also called a false colored image, where data values are transformed to color scale.\nHeat maps allow us to simultaneously visualize clusters of samples and features.\nFirst hierarchical clustering is done of both the rows and the columns of the data matrix.\nThe columns/rows of the data matrix are re-ordered according to the hierarchical clustering result, putting similar observations close to each other.\nThe blocks of ‘high’ and ‘low’ values are adjacent in the data matrix.\nFinally, a color scheme is applied for the visualization and the data matrix is displayed.\nVisualizing the data matrix in this way can help to find the variables that appear to be characteristic for each sample cluster.\n\nPreviously, we described how to visualize dendrograms.\nHere, we’ll demonstrate how to draw and arrange a heatmap in R.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-14"><pk>R Packages/functions for drawing heatmaps</pk></h3>\nThere are a multiple numbers of

annotates and arranges complex heatmaps (very useful for genomic data analysis)\n\nHere, we start by describing the 5 R functions for drawing heatmaps.\nNext, we’ll focus on the <em>ComplexHeatmap</em> package, which provides a flexible solution to arrange and annotate multiple heatmaps.\nIt allows also to visualize the association between different data from different sources.\n\n<h3 id="UsingHeatmaptopic-15"><pk>Data preparation</pk></h3>\nWe use mtcars data as a demo data set.\nWe start by standardizing the data to make variables comparable:\n<gr>df &lt;-

respectively.\nFor example, in the the R code below will customize the heatmap as follow:\n<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">\nAn RColorBrewer color palette name is used to change the appearance\nThe argument <em>RowSideColors</em> and <em>ColSideColors</em> are used to annotate rows and columns respectively.\nThe expected values for these options are a vector containing color

heatmap by rows</h3>\nYou can split the heatmap using either the k-means algorithm or a grouping variable.\n\nIt’s important to use the set.seed() function when performing k-means so that the results obtained can be reproduced precisely at a later time.\n\nTo split the dendrogram using k-means, type this:\n\n<gr><z># Divide into 2 groups</z>\nset.seed(<k>2</k>)\nHeatmap(df, name = <r>"mtcars"</r>, k = <k>2</k>)</gr>\n\nTo split by a grouping variable, use the argument <em>split</em>.\nIn the following example we’ll use the levels of the factor variable cyl [in mtcars data set] to split the heatmap by rows.\nRecall that the column cyl corresponds to the number of cylinders.\n\n<gr><z># split by a vector specifying rowgroups</z>\nHeatmap(df, name = <r>"mtcars"</r>, split = mtcars$cyl,\n

it by just assigning the partitioning vector to split.\nIn the R code below, we’ll use <em>pam</em>() function [cluster package].\npam() stands for Partitioning of the data into k clusters “around medoids”, a more robust version of K-means.\n\n<gr><z># install.packages("cluster")</z>\n<m>library</m>(<r>"cluster"</r>)\nset.seed(<k>2</k>)\npa = pam(df, k = <k>3</k>)\nHeatmap(df, name =

'<h2>相关性分析</h2>\n世间万事万物绝不是独立发展的，世间万事万物是相互联系的。\n\n有些事物之间存在联系，有些事物之间不存在联系。\n有些事物之间存在直接联系，有些事物之间存在间接联系。\n\n有些事物之间存在的联系比较强，有些事物之间存在的联系比较弱。\n\n我们的目的是找到哪些事物存在联系？\n并作出判断，判断这种联系是相关关系呢？\n还是因果关系呢？\n这里我们主要关注的是相关关系。\n如果事物之间存在相关关系，那么，这种相关关系是直接关系呢？\n还是间接关系呢？\n这种相关关系是强相关关系呢？\n还是弱相关关系呢？\n这种相关关系有没有统计学显著性呢？\n\n相关分析的目的是研究事件之间是否存在某种相关关系？\n如果事件之间确实存在某种相关关系，那么，需要进一步定量计算相关的方向和相关的强度。\n\n这里需要注意的是：相关关系不是因果关系，相关关系中的事件之间没有先后顺序。\n\n例如，在一个系统内，我们观察到了\nA 事件和 B 事件，发现 A 事件和 B 事件同时变化，这就说明 A 事件和 B\n事件之间可能存在相关关系。\n\n在相关关系的基础上进一步深入研究，如果我们能说清楚是\nA 事件导致了 B 事件，还是 B 事件导致了 A 事件，我们就得到了 A 事件和 B\n事件之间的因果关系。\n\n前面相关分析的定义已经说了，相关分析就是寻找相关关系，那么，什么是相关关系？\n相关关系有哪些呢？\n\n事件之间的相关关系可以分为两类：函数关系和统计关系。\n那么，什么是函数关系呢？\n什么是统计关系呢？\n\n函数关系是指两个事件之间的取值能用数学函数来唯一描述，即两个事件之间的取值是一一对应关系。\n例如，我们要卖衣服，卖衣服的销售总额与销售量之间就是函数关系。\n销售总额等于销售量乘以销售单价。\n函数关系不是我们关注的重点，我们重点关注的是统计关系。\n\n统计关系是指两个事件之间的取值不能用数学函数来唯一描述，即两个事件之间的取值不是一一对应关系，但是两个事件之间的取值按照某种规律在一定范围内变化。\n例如，子女身高与父母身高，子女身高和父母身高不能用一个函数关系一一对应，但是子女身高和父母身高确实存在一定规律，多数情况下，父母身高越高，子女身高就越高。\n\n这种具有一定规律的关系，就是统计关系。\n统计关系按照统计相关的表现形式，也可以分成三个不同的统计相关类型，分别是简单相关关系、偏相关关系、距离相关关系。\n这里我们重点关注简单相关关系。\n那么，什么是简单相关关系呢？\n\n线性相关关系就是直线相关关系。\n其实我们平时常说的相关关系，基本上都是指的线性相关关系，这种线性相关关系有方向，也有强度。\n那么，怎么表征线性相关关系的方向呢？\n怎么表征线性相关关系的强度呢？\n\n线性相关关系的方向无非两种，分别是正向相关、负向相关。\n表征线性相关关系方向的方法有三种，分别是散点图、相关系数、线性拟合。\n\n第一种方式是散点图，一个事件的取值随着另一个事件的取值的增加而增加，这种线性相关关系就是正向相关，一个事件的取值随着另一个事件的取值的增加而减少，这种线性相关关系就是负向相关。\n第二种方式是相关系数，相关系数是正值就是正向相关，相关系数是负值就是负向相关。\n第三种方式是线性拟合，拟合系数是正值就是正向相关，拟合系数是负值就是负向相关。\n\n表征线性相关关系强度的方法有一种，就是相关系数。\n相关系数有三种，分别是\npearson 相关系数、spearman 相关系数、kendall\n相关系数。\n每种相关系数都有其特殊的使用条件，那么，三种相关系数的使用条件分别是什么呢？\n\npearson 相关系数是最常使用的相关系数，pearson 相关系数等于 XY\n的协方差除以 X 的标准差和 Y\n的标准差。\n\n两个变量都是连续型变量（自己判断）；\n两个变量是配对的，来自于同一个个体（自己判断）；\n两个变量之间存在线性关系（散点图/散点图矩阵判断）；\n两个变量没有明显的异常值，因为异常值对pearson相关性分析的结果影响很大（箱线图判断）；\n两个变量呈双变量正态分布或近似正态分布（Q-Q图判断、Shapiro-Wilk检验判断）。\n\n这里需要注意第5个条件，两个变量呈双变量正态分布，这里说的双变量正态分布不是两个变量都是正态分布的意思，双变量正态分布是另一个统计学概念，可以参考以下资料网络资料1，网络资料2。\n通俗地说，如果两个变量呈双变量正态分布，那么这两个变量一定都是正态分布。\n如果两个变量都是正态分布，然而这两个变量不一定呈双变量正态分布。\n一般情况下，我们都用“两个变量都是正态分布”这个条件代替“两个变量呈双变量正态分布”这个条件，因为SPSS统计软件不能检验双变量正态分布，这样的替代条件，我们目前还是可以接受的。\n\npearson 相关系数的取值范围是[-1, 1] 。\n在实际应用过程中，我们往往会将\npearson 相关系数的取值划分为 4 个区间。\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>相关系数</th><th>相关程度</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0.8-1.0</td><td>高度相关</td></tr><tr><td>0.5-0.8</td><td>中度相关</td></tr><tr><td>0.3-0.5</td><td>低度相关</td></tr><tr><td>0.0-0.3</td><td>不相关</td></tr></tbody></table>\n另一个常用的相关分析是 spearman 相关系数。\n计算 spearman\n相关系数，需要满足两个条件网络资料。\n两个包含等级变量、或变量不服从正态分布、或分布类型未知；\n两个变量之间存在单调关系。\n\n相关关系是好的，也是坏的。\n我们有时候想要得到这种相关关系，就说这种相关关系是好的。\n比如说，做源解析的时候，具有相关关系的变量可能来自于同一个源。\n做单变量线性拟合的时候，原因变量和结果变量存在相关关系，说明原因变量对结果变量有影响。\n但是，我们有时候不想要得到这种相关关系，就说这种相关关系是坏的。\n\n比如说，做多变量线性拟合的时候，各个原因变量之间应该是独立的，不应该存在相关关系，如果存在相关关系，就造成了多重共线性问题，多重共线性是个坏东西，他会干扰多变量拟合的结果，他可能会改变拟合系数的大小和符号，甚至会让本身显著的原因变量变的不显著。\n\n计算相关系数的R包主要包括：\nstats: R 语言的基础包之一，提供了计算 Pearson、Spearman 和 Kendall\n相关系数的函数cor()，不提供显著性检验结果。\n\nrstatix: 提供了cor_test()函数，支持 Pearson、Spearman 和 Kendall\n相关系数的计算，并给出相关性的显著性检验结果。\n\nHmisc: 提供了rcorr()函数，可以计算 Pearson 和 Spearman\n相关系数，并给出相关性的显著性检验结果。\n\npsych: 提供了corr.test()函数，支持 Pearson、Spearman、Kendall\n等多种相关系数的计算，并可以进行显著性检验和置信区间的估计。\n\ncorrr:\n专注于相关系数矩阵的分析、可视化和处理，提供了一系列函数来探索和处理相关系数。\n\nggcorrplot:\n用于可视化相关系数矩阵，虽然不直接计算相关系数，但与计算相关系数的包配合使用非常方便。\n\nPerformanceAnalytics:\n主要用于金融分析领域，提供了chart.Correlation()函数，可以用于可视化资产回报率的相关系数矩阵。\n\ndata(iris)\niris &lt;- iris[, 1:4]\n\n# stats 包\ncor(iris, method = "pearson") # 相关系数矩阵\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length    1.0000000  -0.1175698    0.8717538   0.8179411\nSepal.Width    -0.1175698   1.0000000   -0.4284401  -0.3661259\nPetal.Length    0.8717538  -0.4284401    1.0000000   0.9628654\nPetal.Width     0.8179411  -0.3661259    0.9628654   1.0000000\ncor.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, method = "pearson") # 只能两两检验，效率低\n\n    Pearson\'s product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length and iris$Sepal.Width\nt = -1.4403, df = 148, p-value = 0.1519\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.27269325  0.04351158\nsample estimates:\n       cor \n-0.1175698\n\n# rstatix 包，强烈推荐\nrstatix::cor_test(iris, method = "pearson") # 相关系数矩阵、显著性检验矩阵和置信区间矩阵\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 8\n   var1         var2           cor  statistic        p conf.low conf.high method\n   &lt;chr&gt;

of Squares: SST, SSR, SSE\nsum of squares total (SST)\nor the total sum of squares (TSS)\nThe sum of squares is a statistical measure of variability.\nIt indicates the dispersion of data points around the mean and how much the dependent variable deviates from the predicted values in regression analysis.\n\nhttps://365datascience.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorials/sum-squares/\n\n<h3 id="clusterTypestopic-0">① 肘部法则</h3>\n把握一个核心：类别内差异尽量小，类别间差异尽量大。\n\n核心概念：误差平方和 <gr>SSE</gr>\n该值可用于测量各点与中心点的距离情况（类别内的差异大小），理论上是希望越小越好。\n该指标可用于辅助判断聚类类别个数，如果发现比如从n个聚类到n+1个类别时SSE值减少幅度明显很大，此时选择n+1个聚类类别较好。\n\n类似于SPSS中的碎石图。\n\nSSE：每个点到其所属簇中心的距离平方和。\n\n随着K值的增加，SSE通常会减小，因为样本会被划分得越来越精细。\n\n肘方法的核心在于寻找SSE下降速度减缓的转折点，即“肘点”，这个点通常被认为是数据集中真实的聚类数量。\n\n它的本质与主成分分析、因子分析中的"碎石图"并无差别，但这种方法主观性较强。\n\n<img

轮廓系数</h3>\n\n轮廓系数结合了内聚度和分离度两种因素，即同时考察了组内相似性和组间差异性。\n\n对于每个样本，计算它与同簇其他样本的平均距离(a)和它与最近簇内所有样本的平均距离(b)。\n\n轮廓系数的值介于[-1, 1]之间，接近1表示样本很好地匹配到了簇，接近-1则表示样本更匹配其他簇。\n\n整体轮廓系数为所有样本轮廓系数的平均值。\n\n对于不同的K值，计算对应的平均轮廓系数，选择使得轮廓系数最大的K值作为最佳聚类数。\n\n应用范围：K-means聚类和系统聚类等均适用。\n\n实现工具：\n<gr>R（cluster-silhouette）</gr>：代码如下。\n\n<img

id="clusterTypestopic-3">④ 卡林斯基-哈拉巴斯指数 Calinski-Harabasz Index)</h3>\n\n一种评估聚类效果的指标，它是簇间离散度与簇内离散度的比值。\n该指数的值越大，表示簇间的差异性越大而簇内的差异性越小，聚类效果越好。\n通过计算不同K值的CH指数并选择最大值对应的K值作为最佳聚类数。\n\n应用范围：通常用于评估基于方差的聚类方法的聚类质量，最常见的是K均值聚类，层次聚类&amp;DBSCAN也会用到。\n\n实现工具：\n<gr>R（自定义函数）</gr>：内置函数似乎无法实现，需要自定义函数calinski_harabasz_index，代码有点复杂，如下。\n\n<img

id="clusterTypestopic-4">⑤ 戴维斯-博尔丁指数 Davies-Bouldin Index)</h3>\n\n是一种评估聚类效果的指标，它基于聚类内距离和聚类间距离的比率。\nDB指数的值越小，表示聚类效果越好。\n通过计算不同K值的DB指数并选择最小值对应的K值作为最佳聚类数。\n\n戴维斯-博尔丁指数计算简单，易于理解，因此可以广泛应用于各种聚类方法的评估中。\n\n应用范围：K-Means聚类、系统聚类、DBSCAN聚类等\n实现工具：\n<gr>R（自定义函数）</gr>：网上说是cluster包有包含计算DBI的函数，但尝试失败，需要自定义函数davies_bouldin_index，代码有点复杂，如下。\n\n<img

id="clusterTypestopic-5">⑥ Gap Statistic Gap值)</h3>\n通过比较实际数据的聚类结果与随机生成的数据的聚类结果来估计数据集中的聚类数目。\n这种方法不依赖于特定的聚类算法，可以与多种聚类方法结合使用。\n\n但要注意的是，Gap Statistic本身并不能确定最佳的聚类数目，而是通过比较不同聚类数目下的Gap Statistic值来<gr>帮助</gr>选择最佳的聚类数目（最大值通常对应于最佳的聚类数目，因为它表示在这个数目下，原始数据的聚类结构与随机数据的聚类结构差异最大）。\n\n因此，在使用Gap Statistic时，还需要结合其他方法来确定最佳的聚类数目。\n<gr>原理</gr>：\n对于真实数据集，聚类结果会形成紧密的簇。\n\n而对于随机数据集，由于数据是随机生成的，因此不会形成明显的簇。\n\n因此，如果聚类结果较好，真实数据集的聚类间隔应该比随机数据集的聚类间隔要大。\n\n应用范围：K-means聚类（最初用途）、密度聚类、系统聚类等\n实现工具：\n<gr>R（cluster）：</gr>\n<img

Cross-Validation)</h3>\n虽不常见，但交叉验证也可以用来确定聚类数。\n\n通过将数据集分成几个部分，并在不同部分上重复聚类过程，然后评估聚类结果的一致性，可以帮助选择一个稳健的K值。\n\n<h3 id="clusterTypestopic-7">⑧ 信息准则方法</h3>\n\n在二阶聚类的文章中，已对此方法有所介绍，此处不做详细展开。\n\n用于模型选择和评估，帮助研究者在多个潜在模型中选择最佳模型（通过计算不同聚类数目下的特定值来选择最佳聚类数目），它试图平衡模型拟合优度和模型复杂度之间的矛盾。\n\n传统聚类方法如K-means、层次聚类等，往往采用轮廓系数、Calinski-Harabasz指数、Davies-Bouldin指数等聚类评价指标来确定最优聚类数，而不是直接使用信息准则。\n而对于那些可以形式化为概率模型的聚类方法（如高斯混合模型），信息准则就有明确价值。\n\n信息准则方法主要有<gr>赤池信息准则（AIC）</gr>和<gr>贝叶斯信息准则（BIC）</gr>：\n关心泛化能力，更倾向于选择惩罚力度更大的BIC；而如果更关注解释现有数据，AIC是更好的选择。\n\n应用范围：K-means聚类、密度聚类、系统聚类、高斯混合模型等。\n\n必须样本量足够大，因为它考虑了样本大小。\n\n实现工具：\n<gr>R：</gr>\n<gr>赤池信息准则（AIC）</gr>\n样本量不够大，数据会不稳定\n<img

id="ggplot2Manualtopic-0"><U+2003>前言</h3>\n以下的例子中大部分都是用ggplot2，但还用了其他的包，比如meta、VennDiagram、wordcloud、maps包等等。\n\n学习本期的内容涉及到两个方法:\n第一，数据。\n演示的数据一方面来自R和R包内置的数据集，比如iris、mtcars数据集等等，这些都是可以自己自行导入的；另一方面，部分数据是来自我自己的数据，这些数据我已经打包放在一个压缩包里面，文末有下载的链接，需要的同学可自行下载。\n\n第二，代码。\n代码在文档中都有，建议是基础的代码自己敲一遍，如果只是统一搬运过来，当然也不是不可以。\n\n<h3 id="ggplot2Manualtopic-1">1 数据类型</h3>\n开展数据可视化之前，必须要了解R语言中的数据的类型。\n这样才能根据数据类型选择合适的可视化图表。\n我们在绘制图最基础的数据类型可分为以下两类：\n\n（1）连续型变量\n任意两个值之间具有无限个值的数值变量。\n连续变量可以是数值变量，也可以是日期/时间变量。\n比如，3.14,4.65, 5.28等等。\n\n（2）离散变量\n可计数的数值变量，比如，1,2,3等等\n（3）分类变量\nR中称为因子（factor），比如性别（男/女），身高（低/中/高）等等。\n\n<h3 id="ggplot2Manualtopic-2">2 散点图</h3>\n散点图是最常见的图形之一。\n\n<h3 id="ggplot2Manualtopic-3"><U+2003>2.1 基础散点图</h3>\n最基础的语法如下：\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata("mtcars")\nggplot(aes(x =disp,y = mpg),data=mtcars)+geom_point()\n\n<img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/iavoKgCD4nvfA97ZtsShIl5icbQtjWJQyYb5BZMgnibpmibQ4R4kp14mpdMA9LfuOs05psYuejSYys8BxgDGN92Ebg/640">\n\n首先，是加载ggplot2包，还未下载该包的请提前安装“install.packages(“ggplot2”)”。\n\n这里，我们可以看出ggplot2的语法很简单，而且是层层叠加的。\naes()规定了x轴和y轴；然后定义数据集，data= mtcars。\n后面使用geom_point()定义呈现的是散点。\n\n<k>2.2 进阶散点图</k>\n<k>2.2.1设置主题、坐标轴和颜色</k>\n基础语法掌握后，我们进行修改，主要包括：\n\n主题、坐标轴字体和大小、散点大小和颜色、坐标轴标签\n\np1&lt;-ggplot(aes(x =disp,y = mpg),data = mtcars)+\n\n  geom_point(color = "blue",size =3.0,alpha = 0.5 )+#调节散点的颜色、大小和显示度\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(family ="serif",size = 1))+#调节坐标轴字体为罗马字体，大小为14号\n  theme_bw()+#主题可有theme_test或者theme_classic等等\n

=disp,y = mpg),data = mtcars)+\n  geom_point(color = "blue",size =3.0,alpha = 0.5 )+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(family ="serif",size = 1))+\n  theme_test()+

id="ggplot2Manualtopic-4"><U+2003><U+2003>2.2.2 添加平滑曲线和趋势图</h4>\n我们想要在散点图中添加趋势图，ggplot2中用geom_smooth()函数就能轻松完成这个目标。\n默认的采用geom_smooth()是获得非参的平滑曲线估计：\n\np1+geom_smooth()\n\n#\ngeom_smooth()\n using method = \'loess\' and formula = \'y ~ x\'\n\n<img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/iavoKgCD4nvfA97ZtsShIl5icbQtjWJQyYLdicJyHZtw0eTF8PWeia1bJkibvHE7enRR7pQHCicfszZqw6thIIwSKALw/640">\n\n我们想要用线性回归，只需要在增加geom_smooth(method = “lm”)\n\np1+geom_smooth(method = "lm")\n\n\ngeom_smooth()\n using formula = \'y ~ x\'\n\n<img src="https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/iavoKgCD4nvfA97ZtsShIl5icbQtjWJQyYHicicPVyR2lFDQFBKp4AgkAP8npuccrf2wqKh7Fw9Dwpgam5Z5UtGricw/640">\n\n此外我们想在图片中加入回归分析中的P值和R方，这该怎么做呢？\n\n这个时候我们得加载一个ggpmisc包，里面的stat_poly_eq()函数可以帮我们完成这一目标。\n\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\n\np1+geom_smooth(method = "lm")+\n  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..adj.rr.label..,..p.value.label.., sep = \'~~~~\')),formula = y ~ x,parse = TRUE,label.x =0.2,label.y =0.9)\n\n<img

id="ggplot2Manualtopic-5"><U+2003>2.3 多个变量</h3>\n一般来讲，二维的散点图所呈现的变量是有限的，我们用x和y轴表示两个向量，用颜色或形状表示第三个变量，我们来看看这个怎么操作：\n\n数据还是用mtcars数据集\n\nhead(mtcars)\nmpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt qsec vs am gear

“right”、“bottom”、“top”、left、“none”(无图例)来调整图例的上下左右。\n\n在上诉例子中，legend.position=c(0.8,0.8)，表示为右上角区域。\nc(0,1)表示左上角，c(1,0)表示右下角。\n\n<k>2.4

id="ggplot2Manualtopic-23"><U+2003>6.1 基础条形图</h3>\n条形图是一种常见的数据可视化工具，用于显示分类数据的比较。\n它使用水平或垂直的矩形条来代表数据的数值，每个条的长度或高度与其表示的数值成正比。\n条形图通常用于比较不同类别之间的数量或频率，便于观察各类别之间的差异。\n\n什么样的数据适合条形图呢？\n（1）分类数据和离散数据/连续数据\n（2）想要看均值±SD的组别之间的差异\n我们来看看基础的条形图代码：\n\nggplot(aes(x

"count", width=0.9, position="stack")\n\n要注意以下几点：\n<k>（1）stat：</k>设置统计方法，有效值是count（默认值） 和 identity，其中，count表示条形的高度是变量的数量，identity表示条形的高度是变量的值；\n默认情况下，stat=“count”，这意味着每个条的高度等于每组中的数据的个数，并且，它与映射到y的图形属性不相容，所以，当设置stat=“count”时，不能设置映射函数aes()中的y参数。\n如果设置stat=“identity”，这意味着条形的高度表示数据数据的值，而数据的值是由aes()函数的y参数决定的，就是说，把值映射到y，所以，<k>当设置stat=“identity”时，必须设置映射函数中的y参数，把它映射到数值变量。\n</k>\n<k>（2）position</k>：位置调整，有效值是<k>stack、dodge和fill</k>，默认值是stack（堆叠），是指两个条形图堆叠摆放，dodge是指两个条形图并行摆放，fill是指按照比例来堆叠条形图，每个条形图的高度都相等，但是高度表示的数量是不尽相同的。\n\n对该条形图进行组别均值带有误差棒的单因素方差分析并且标注显著性字母的，请查阅上一章3.2.3添加p值和显著性水平。\n\n<h3 id="ggplot2Manualtopic-24"><U+2003>6.2簇状条形图</h3>\n当分类变量出现两组时，就会出现簇状条形图。\n此时可将分类变量映射到fill参数，并运行命令geom_bar(position=“dodge”),这可使得两组条形在水平方向上错开排列。\n\n演示我们用gapminder数据集，该数据结构如下：\n\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nhead(gapminder)\n\n#

Analysis)。\n\n森林图可以让读者直观地看到不同研究的结果，并通过综合多个研究的结果来得出总体结论。\n森林图的关键组成部分有：\n（1）<k>每项研究的结果</k>：每一行通常代表一项独立的研究。\n每个研究的结果通常以点估计（如平均值或比值比）和其置信区间（通常是95%置信区间）表示。\n\n（2）<k>置信区间</k>：点估计的左右两侧会有水平线，表示该点估计的置信区间。\n这条线的长度反映了结果的不确定性。\n置信区间越长，表示该研究结果的不确定性越大。\n\n（3）<k>合并结果</k>：图中通常会有一条垂直线，表示无效值（如相对风险为1，或均值差为0）的参考线。\n下方会有一个菱形或其他符号，表示合并后的总体结果及其置信区间。\n菱形的中心表示合并的点估计，两端表示合并结果的置信区间。\n\n下面，我们用meta和metafor包演示一下森林图的绘制，数据是内置的数据包：\n\nlibrary(meta)\n\nlibrary(metafor)\n\n#

直接选择适合你的编号为xx的镜像\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-7">8. 显示更多数据行</h3>\n默认情况下，R显示1000行数据。\n通过设置max.print可以调整这一限制：\n\noptions(max.print = 2000)  # 设置为显示2000行数据\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-8">9. 设置显示的小数位数</h3>\n默认情况下，R显示数字时保留7位小数。\n通过调整digits选项可以修改这一设置：\n\noptions(digits = 2)  # 设置默认显示两位小数\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-9">10. 管道操作</h3>\n使用管道符号%&gt;%可以让代码更加简洁，避免定义过多的中间变量。\n在R中使用管道前需要加载相关的包：\n\nlibrary(magrittr)  # 加载magrittr包以使用管道\n\nmtcars %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, group = cyl)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-10">11. 拆分列数据</h3>\n在使用数据集时，有时记不住列名或容易拼错。\n使用attach()函数可以将数据集中的每一列变成一个独立的变量，方便直接调用：\n\nattach(mtcars)\n\ncyl  # 显示cyl列的数据\nmpg  # 显示mpg列的数据\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-11">12. 默认加载包</h3>\n如果有经常使用的R包，可以通过修改.Rprofile文件设置R启动时自动加载这些包。\n例如，自动加载ggplot2包：\n\nfile.edit("~/.Rprofile")\n.First &lt;- function() {\n  library(ggplot2)\n}\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-12">13. 为R添加额外扩展包加载路径</h3>\n可以通过修改.libPaths()来添加额外的包安装路径，使R能够在新的目录中查找和安装包：\n\n.libPaths(new = "C:/Users/genom/Desktop/nparFiles/")  # 添加新路径\n\n.libPaths()  # 显示当前所有库路径\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-13">14. 迁移R包</h3>\n当需要在不同设备之间迁移已安装的R包时，可以先在源设备上保存已安装包的列表，然后在目标设备上使用该列表进行安装：\n\n# 在源设备上\nsave(installed.packages()[,1], file = "installedPackages.Rdata")\n\n# 在目标设备上\nload("installedPackages.Rdata")\nfor (i in setdiff(installed.packages()[,1], oldip)) {\n  install.packages(i)\n}\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-14">15. 列出R包中的函数</h3>\n要查看某个R包中包含的所有函数，可以使用ls()函数指定包名：\n\nls(package:base)  # 列出base包中的所有函数\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-15">16. 不加载包使用其中函数</h3>\n在不加载整个R包的情况下使用其中的某个函数，可以使用“包名::函数名”的格式：\n\ndplyr::filter()  # 使用dplyr包中的filter函数\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-16">17. 快速获取颜色</h3>\n在需要快速为图形设置颜色时，可以使用rainbow()函数快速生成多种颜色：\n\nrainbow(6)  # 生成并显示6种不同的颜色\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-17">18. 炸开数据</h3>\n虽然使用attach()函数可以简化数据列的调用，但这可能导致环境变量混乱。\n使用%$%特殊管道符可以更安全地实现相同效果：\n\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nwomen %$% plot(weight, height)  # 使用“炸开”数据来绘图\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-18">19. 巧用example函数学习绘图</h3>\nexample()函数运行R帮助文档中的示例代码，是学习函数使用方法的好助手：\n\nlibrary(pheatmap)\nexample("pheatmap")  # 运行并展示pheatmap函数的示例\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-19">20. 统计计算时间</h3>\n使用system.time()函数可以测量一段代码的运行时间：\n\nsystem.time(runif(100000000))  # 测量生成一亿个随机数的时间\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-20">21. 释放内存</h3>\n在R中，即使删除了变量，内存也不会立即释放。\n可以通过gc()函数手动触发垃圾回收，释放内存：\n\nmemory.size()  # 显示当前内存使用量\nrm(list = ls())  # 删除所有变量\ngc()  # 执行垃圾回收\nmemory.size()  # 再次显示内存使用量\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-21">22. 删除全部变量并释放内存</h3>\n\nls()  # 显示所有变量\n\nrm(list = ls())  # 删除所有变量\ngc()  # 执行垃圾回收\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-22">23. 恢复默认数据集</h3>\n如果不慎删除或覆盖了内置数据集，可以通过data()函数恢复：\n\ndata("mtcars")  # 恢复mtcars数据集\n\nhead(mtcars)  # 显示数据集的前几行\n\n<h3 id="advancedTechniquetopic-23">24. 快速获取函数选项参数</h3>\n使用args()函数可以快速查看任何R函数的参数列表，无需查阅帮助文档：\n\nargs(heatmap)  # 显示heatmap函数的参数列表\n',

查看类型\n## [1] "numeric"\n\n# 创建一个名字是b的向量\nb &lt;- c("one", "two", "three")\n\n# 创建一个名字是d的向量，不用c是为了避免和函数 c() 混淆\nd &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)</gr>\n这里，<gr>a</gr>是数值型向量，<gr>b</gr>是字符型向量，而<gr>d</gr>是逻辑型向量。\n向量中的值被称为<pk>元素</pk>（element），比如向量<gr>a</gr>的第一个元素是<gr>1</gr>，向量<gr>b</gr>的第一个元素是<gr>"one"</gr>。\n\n注意，单个向量中的数据有相同的类型或模式（数值型、字符型或逻辑型）。\n同一向量中无法混杂不同类型的数据。\n比如：\n<gr># 会都变成字符型\na &lt;- c("a",1,TRUE)\na\n## [1] "a"    "1"    "TRUE"</gr>\n除了通过<gr>c()</gr>创建向量，还可以使用<gr>seq()</gr>（sequence的缩写）创建数值型的向量，比如，创建一个从1~20的向量，并且步长设置为2：\n<gr># 从1到20，中间间隔2\nseq(1, 20, 2)\n##  [1]  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19</gr>\n重复某个值也可以得到一个向量：\n<gr># rep是replicate的缩写\nrep(1:2, times = 3) #

id="applyseriestopic-0">循环</h3>\n<gr>for</gr>循环是一个元素一个元素的操作，在R语言中这种做法是比较低效的，更好的做法是向量化操作，也就是同时对一整行/列进行操作，不用逐元素操作，这样可以大大加快运行速度。\n\napply函数家族就是这样的一组函数，专门实现向量化操作，可替代for循环。\n\n先举个简单的例子，说明下什么是向量化。\n假如你有如下一个向量<gr>a</gr>，你想让其中的每个元素都加1，你不用把每个元素单独拎出来加1：\n<gr>a &lt;- c(1,2,3,NA)\na + 1 # 直接加1即可，是不是很方便？\n## [1]  2  3  4 NA</gr>\n再举个例子，下面这个数据框中有一些<gr>NA</gr>除此之外还有一些空白，或者空格。\n如何批量替换这些值？\n<gr>tmp &lt;- data.frame(a = c(1,1,3,4),\n                  b = c("one","two","three","four"),\n                  d = c(""," ",NA,90),\n                  e = c(" ",NA, "",20) )\ntmp\n##   a     b    d    e\n## 1 1   one          \n## 2 1   two      &lt;NA&gt;\n## 3 3 three &lt;NA&gt;     \n## 4 4  four   90   20</gr>\n比如，让<gr>NA</gr>都变成999。\n\n常规的做法是：检查每一个值，确认它是不是<gr>NA</gr>，如果是，就改成999，如果不是，就不改。\n\n向量化的做法是：\n<gr>tmp[is.na(tmp)] &lt;- 999\n# tmp[tmp == NA] &lt;- 999 # 错误的做法\ntmp\n##   a     b   d   e\n## 1 1   one        \n## 2 1   two     999\n## 3 3 three 999    \n## 4 4  four  90  20</gr>\n再比如，让空白的地方变成<gr>NA</gr>：\n<gr>tmp[tmp == ""] &lt;- NA\ntmp\n##   a     b    d    e\n## 1 1   one &lt;NA&gt;     \n## 2 1   two       999\n## 3 3 three  999 &lt;NA&gt;\n## 4 4  four   90   20</gr>\n为什么还有一些空白？因为有的空白是真空白，有的则是空格！\n<gr>tmp[tmp == " "] &lt;- NA\ntmp\n##   a     b    d    e\n## 1 1   one &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;\n## 2 1   two &lt;NA&gt;  999\n## 3 3 three  999 &lt;NA&gt;\n## 4 4  four   90   20</gr>\n以上示例旨在告诉大家，有很多时候并不需要逐元素循环，向量化是更好的方式。\n\n<h3

13.40406</gr>\n如果使用<gr>for</gr>循环，就会显得很麻烦，运行时间也会长一点：\n<gr>tmp &lt;- vector("numeric", nrow(coad_mrna_df))\nfor(i in 1:nrow(coad_mrna_df)){\n  tmp[i] &lt;-

13.40406</gr>\n除了3个主要的参数，<gr>apply</gr>还有一个<gr>...</gr>参数，它表示：如果你要执行的操作中还有其他参数，可以直接往后写。\n比如<gr>mean()</gr>这个函数有一个<gr>na.rm</gr>参数，表示要不要在计算时去除缺失值，你可以直接把这个参数写在后面：\n<gr>tmp &lt;- apply(coad_mrna_df, 1,

8.056527</gr>\n上面的示例只是为了演示<gr>apply</gr>的用法，实际上在计算某一行/列的均值/加和时，R自带了几个函数，比如计算每一行的均值：\n<gr>tmp &lt;- rowMeans(coad_mrna_df)\nhead(tmp)\n##   MT-CO2   MT-CO3   MT-ND4   MT-CO1  MT-ATP6   MT-ND3 \n##

nrow(coad_mrna_df))\n  for(i in 1:nrow(coad_mrna_df)){\n    tmp[i] &lt;- mean(as.numeric(coad_mrna_df[i,]))\n    }\n})\n##    user  system elapsed \n##    0.39    0.00    0.40\nsystem.time(tmp &lt;-

0</gr>\n要执行的操作除了可以是R自带的函数外，还可以是自编函数。\n比如：筛选在所有样本中的表达量的加和大于800的基因：\n<gr># 对每一行执行1个操作\n# 计算每一行的加和，并和800进行比较 \ntmp &lt;- apply(coad_mrna_df, 1, function(x){sum(x)&gt;800})\nhead(tmp)\n##  MT-CO2  MT-CO3

350\n#coad_mrna_df[tmp,]</gr>\n当然上面只是为了演示如何在<gr>apply</gr>中使用自编函数，实际使用时还是用<gr>rowSums</gr>更快更简单：\n<gr>tmp &lt;- rowSums(coad_mrna_df) &gt; 800\nhead(tmp)\n##  MT-CO2  MT-CO3  MT-ND4  MT-CO1 MT-ATP6

One way is to create a new categorical variable that would identify the patients with post BP less than 140 mm Hg (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nThis new categorical variable would be considered a <em>derived variable</em>.\n\nThe data for the fictional study I\'ve described also contains an underlying dimension of time.\nAs the description implies, each patient\'s blood pressure was measured before and after they took the drug (or placebo).\nSo these data could conceivably have variables for <em>date of enrollment </em>(the date a patient entered the study), <em>date of pre blood pressure</em> measurement (baseline measurements),<em> date of drug delivery</em> (patient takes the drug), <em>date of post blood pressure </em>measurement (blood pressure measurement taken at the end of the study).\n\n<h4 id="begintidyversetopic-5"><U+2003>What\'s an observation?</h4>\nObservations are the unit of analysis or whatever the "thing" is that\'s being described by the variables.\nSticking with our hypothetical blood pressure trial, the patients would be the unit of analysis.\n\nIn a <em>tidy</em> dataset, we would expect each row to represent a single patient.\nObservations are a bit like nouns, in a sense that pinning down an exact definition can be difficult, and it often relies heavily on how the data were collected and what kind of questions you\'re trying to answer.\nOther terms for observations include records, cases, examples, instance, or samples.\n<h4 id="begintidyversetopic-6"><U+2003>What is the data table?</h4>\nTables are made up of values.\nAnd as you have probably already guessed, a value is the thing in a spreadsheet that isn\'t a row or a column.\n\nI find it helpful to think of values as physical locations in a table – they are what lie at the intersection of a variable and an observation.\nFor example, imagine a single number, 75, sitting in a table.\n<table><thead>\n<tr><th></th><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>Row 1</td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Row 2</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\nWe could say this number\'s location is the intersection of Column 2 and Row 2, but that doesn\'t tell us much.\nThe data, 75, is meaningless sitting in a cell without any information about what it represents.\nA number all alone in a table begs the question, "<em>seventy-five what?</em>"\n\nThis is why thinking of a table as being made of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows) helps get to the meaning behind the values in each cell.\nAfter adding variable (column) and observation (row) names, we can see that this 75 is the pre diastolic blood pressure (Pre_Dia_BP) for patient number 3 (patient_3).\n<table><thead>\n<tr><th></th><th>Col 1</th><th>Pre_Dia_BP</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Row 1</td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>patient_3</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\nIt\'s also worth pointing out that this same information could be presented in another way:\n<table><thead>\n<tr><th></th><th>meas_type</th><th>Dia_BP</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Row 1</td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>patient_3</td><td>pre</td><td>75</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThis arrangement is displaying the same information (i.e.\nthe pre diastolic blood pressure for patient number 3), but now the column meas_type is containing the information on <em>which</em> blood pressure measurement the 75 represents (pre).\nWhich one is <em>tidy</em>? In order to answer this, we will build a pet example to establish some basic <em>tidying</em> terminology.\n<h3 id="begintidyversetopic-7">How the "tibble" is better than a table</h3>\nWe will use the call below to create a <em>key-value pair </em>reference tibble.\ntibbles are an optimized way to store data when using packages from the tidyverse and you should read more about them here.\n\nWe are going to build a tibble from scratch, defining the columns (variables), rows (observations), and contents of each cell (value).\nBy doing this, we\'ll be able to keep track of what happens as we rearrange these data.\nThe goal of this brief exercise is to make key-value pairs easier to see and understand.\nOur new object (key_value) is built with the following underlying logic.\n\n<em>Rows</em> are numbered with a number (1–3) and an underscore (_), and always appear at the front of a value.\n<em>Columns</em> are numbered with an underscore (_) and a number (1–3), and always appear at the end of a value.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nkey_value &lt;- tribble(\n     ~row, ~key1, ~key2, ~key3, <o>#</o> These are the names of the columns (indicated with ~)\n     "1", "1_value_1","1_value_2","1_value_3", <o>#</o> Row 1\n     "2", "2_value_1", "2_value_2", "2_value_3", <o>#</o> Row 2\n     "3", "3_value_1", "3_value_2", "3_value_3" <o>#</o> Row 3\n)\nkey_value\n\nSo, the <em>value</em> for key1 and row = 1 is 1_value_1; The <em>value</em> for key2 and row = 2 is 2_value_2; and so on.\n\nThe first number #_ represents the row (observation) position, the trailing number _# represents the key_ column (variable) position.\n<h3 id="begintidyversetopic-8">Using the tidyr package</h3>\ntidyr is a package from the tidyverse that helps you structure (or re-structure) your data so its easier to visualize and model.\nHere is a link to the tidyr page.\n<em>Tidying</em> a data set usually involves some combination of either converting rows to columns (spreading), or switching the columns to rows (gathering).\nWe can use our key_value object to explore how these functions work.\n<h3 id="begintidyversetopic-9">Using gather</h3>\n"Gather takes multiple columns and collapses into key-value pairs, duplicating all other columns as needed.\nYou use gather() when you notice that you have columns that are not variables."\nThat\'s how tidyverse defines <em>gather</em>.\n\nLet\'s start by gathering the three key columns into a single column, with a new column value that will contain all their values.\n\nkv_gathered &lt;- key_value %&gt;% \n     gather(key, <o>#</o> this will be the new column for the 3 key columns\n            value, <o>#</o> this will contain the 9 distinct values\n            key1:key3, <o>#</o> this is the range of columns we want gathered\n            na.rm = TRUE <o>#</o> handles missing\n            )\nkv_gathered\n\nNotice the structure:\n\nThe new key column is now 9 rows, with the values from the three former key1, key2, and key3 columns.\nThe value column contains all the content from the cells at each intersection of row and the key1, key2, and key3 columns\n\nI call this arrangement of data "stacked." Wickham refers to this as indexed.\nBut the important takeaway is that we\'ve used gather() to scoop up the data that was originally scattered across three columns and placed them into two columns: key and value.\n<img src="https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tibble1-500x277.png" loading="lazy">\n<h4 id="begintidyversetopic-10"><U+2003>Using key-value pairs</h4>\nKey-value pairs pair up keys and values.\nThis means when we specified key as the name of the new column, the command took the three previous key columns and stacked them in it.\nThen we specified value as the name of the new column with their corresponding value pair.\n<em>What about the row column?</em> We left this column out of the call because we want it to stay in the same arrangement (i.e.\n1,2,3).\n\nWhen the key and value columns get stacked, these rows get repeated down the column,\nNothing was lost in the process, either.\nI can still look at row:3,key:2 and see the resulting value 3_value_2.\n<h3 id="begintidyversetopic-11">Using spread</h3>\nNow we\'ll spread the key and value columns back into their original arrangement (three columns of key_1, key_2, &amp; key_3).\nThe spread description reads: <em>"Spread a key-value pair across multiple columns."</em>\n\nkv_spreaded &lt;- kv_gathered %&gt;% \n     spread(\n          key, \n          value\n          )\nkv_spreaded\n\nSpread moved the values that were stacked in two columns (key and value) into the three distinct key_ columns.\n<img src="https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/spread1-500x148.png" loading="lazy">\n\nThe <em>key-value</em> pairs are the indexes we can use to rearrange the data to make it tidy.\nWhich version of the key_value is tidy? We stated that tidy data means, <em>"one variable per column, one observation per row,"</em> so the arrangement that satisfied this condition is the key_gathered data set.\nBut I want to stress that without knowledge of what these variables and observations actually contain, we can\'t really know if these data are tidy.\n',

considering the example in the introduction, let’s consider, for instance, the following information for a given client. \n\nMonthly expenses: $300\nAge: 27\nRating: 4.5\n\nThis information has different scales and performing PCA using such data will lead to a biased result. \n\nThis is where data normalization comes in. \n\nIt ensures that each attribute has the same level of contribution, preventing one variable from dominating others. \n\nFor each variable, normalization is done by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation.   \n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-2">Step 2 - Covariance matrix</h3>\nAs the same suggests, this step is about computing the <k>covariance matrix</k> from the normalized data. \n\nThis is a symmetric matrix, and each element (i, j) corresponds to the covariance between variables i and j.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-3">Step 3 - Eigenvectors and eigenvalues</h3>\nGeometrically, an <k>eigenvector</k> represents a direction such as “vertical” or “90 degrees”. \n\nAn <k>eigenvalue</k>, on the other hand, is a number representing the amount of variance present in the data for a given direction. \nEach  eigenvector has its corresponding eigenvalue. \n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-4">Step 4 - Selection of principal components</h3>\nThere are as many pairs of eigenvectors and eigenvalues as the number of variables in the data. \n\nIn the data with only monthly expenses, age, and rate, there will be three pairs. \n\nNot all the pairs are relevant. \nSo, the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue corresponds to the first principal component. \n\nThe second principal component is the eigenvector with the second highest eigenvalue, and so on.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-5">Step 5 - Data transformation in new dimensional space</h3>\nThis step involves re-orienting the original data onto a new subspace defined by the principal components This reorientation is done by multiplying the original data by the previously computed eigenvectors.\n\nIt is important to remember that this transformation does not modify the original data itself but instead provides a new perspective to better represent the data. \n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-6"><pk>Applications of Principal Component Analysis </pk></h3>\nPrincipal component analysis has a variety of applications in our day-to-day life, including (but by no means limited to) finance, image processing, healthcare, and security.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-7">Finance</h3>\nForecasting stock prices from past prices is a notion used in research for years. \n\nPCA can be used for dimensionality reduction and analyzing the data to help experts find relevant components that account for most of the data’s variability. \n\nYou can learn more about dimensionality reduction in R in our dedicated course. \n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-8">Image processing</h3>\nAn image is made of multiple features. \nPCA is mainly applied in image compression to retain the essential details of a given image while reducing the number of dimensions. \n\nIn addition, PCA can be used for more complicated tasks such as image recognition.   \n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-9">Healthcare</h3>\nIn the same logic of image compression. \nPCA is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to reduce the dimensionality of the images for better visualization and medical analysis. \n\nIt can also be integrated into medical technologies used, for instance, to recognize a given disease from image scans.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-10">Security</h3>\nBiometric systems used for fingerprint recognition can integrate technologies leveraging principal component analysis to extract the most relevant features, such as the texture of the fingerprint and additional information. \n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-11"><pk>Real-World Example of PCA in R</pk></h3>\nNow that you understand the underlying theory of PCA, you are finally ready to see it in action.\n\nThis section covers all the steps from installing the relevant packages, loading and preparing the data applying principal component analysis in R, and interpreting the results. \nThe source code is available from DataCamp’s workspace.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-12">Setting up the environment </h3>\nTo successfully perform this tutorial, you’ll need the following libraries, and each one requires two main steps to be used efficiently: \n\nInstall the library to access all the functions.\nLoad to be able to use all the functions.\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-13"><U+2003>corrr package in R</h4>\nThis is an R package for correlation analysis. \nIt mainly focuses on creating and handling R data frames. \nBelow are the steps to install and load the library. \n\n<code>install.packages("corrr")\nlibrary(\'corrr\')</code>\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-14"><U+2003>ggcorrplot package in R</h4>\nThe ggcorrplot package provides multiple functions but is not limited to the ggplot2 function that makes it easy to visualize correlation matrix. \n\nSimilarly to the above instruction, the installation is straightforward.\n\n<code>install.packages("ggcorrplot")\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)</code>\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-15"><U+2003>FactoMineR package in R</h4>\n\nMainly used for multivariate exploratory data analysis; the factoMineR package gives access to the PCA module to perform principal component analysis. \n\n<code>install.packages("FactoMineR")\nlibrary("FactoMineR")</code>\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-16"><U+2003>factoextra package in R</h4>\nThis last package provides all the relevant functions to visualize the outputs of the principal component analysis. \n\nThese functions include but are not limited to scree plot, biplot, only to mention two of the visualization techniques covered later in the article.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-17">Exploring the data</h3>\nBefore loading the data and performing any further exploration, it is good to understand and have the basic information related to the data you will be working with.  \n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-18"><U+2003>Protein data</h4>\nThe protein data set is a real-valued multivariate data set describing the average protein consumption by citizens of 25 European countries. \n\nFor each country, there are ten columns. \nThe first eight correspond to the different types of proteins. \nThe last one corresponds to the total value of the average values of proteins.\n\nLet’s have a quick overview of the data. \nFirst, we load the data using the <code>read.csv()</code> function, then <code>str()</code> which gives the image below. \n\n<code>protein_data &lt;- read.csv("protein.csv")\nstr(protein_data)</code>\n\nWe can see that the data set has 25 observations and 11 columns, and each variable is numerical, except the <k>Country</k> column, which is a text. \n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290159/Description_of_the_protein_data_92329ceac9.png">\nDescription of the protein data\n\n<h4

tackle those values.  Our Top Techniques to Handle Missing Values Every Data Scientist Should Know tutorial can help you make the right choice. \n\n<code>colSums(is.na(protein_data))</code>\n\nThe <code>colSums()</code> function combined with the <code>is.na()</code> returns the number of missing values in each column. \nAs we can see below, none of the columns have missing values.\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290160/Number_of_missing_values_in_each_column_b1b615586b.png">\nNumber of missing values in each column\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-20"><U+2003>Normalizing the data</h4>\nAs stated early in the article, PCA only works with numerical values. \nSo, we need to get rid of the <k>Country</k> column. \n\nAlso, the <k>Total</k> column is not relevant to the analysis since it is the linear combination of the remaining numerical variables.\nThe code below creates new data with only numeric columns.\n\n<code>numerical_data &lt;- protein_data[,2:10]\nhead(numerical_data)</code>\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290160/Before_the_normalization_of_the_data_57dc8d855b.png">\n\nBefore the normalization of the data (only the first five columns are shown)\n\nNow, the normalization can be applied using the scale() function. \n\n<code>data_normalized &lt;- scale(numerical_data)\nhead(data_normalized)</code>\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290160/Normalized_data_a5064d030c.png">\nNormalized data (only first five columns shown)\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-21">Applying PCA</h3>\nNow, all the resources are available to conduct the PCA analysis. \n\nFirst, the <code>princomp()</code> computes the PCA, and <code>summary()</code> function shows the result.\n\n<code>data.pca &lt;- princomp(data_normalized)\n\nsummary(data.pca)</code>\n\nPowered By <svg viewBox="0 0 152 36" xml:space="preserve" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle cx="9.194" cy="11.214" fill="var(--wf-brand--text, #05192D)" r="7.194"></circle></svg></pre>\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290160/r_pca_summary_62029f378f.png">\n\nR PCA summary \n\nFrom the previous screenshot, we notice that nine principal components have been generated (Comp.1 to Comp.9), which also correspond to the number of variables in the data.\n\nEach component explains a percentage of the total variance in the data set. \n\nIn the <k>Cumulative Proportion</k> section, the first principal component explains almost 77% of the total variance. \n\nThis implies that almost two-thirds of the data in the set of 9 variables can be represented by just the first principal component. \n\nThe second one explains 12.08% of the total variance. \n\nThe cumulative proportion of Comp.1 and Comp.2 explains nearly 89% of the total variance. \n\nThis means that the first two principal components can accurately represent the data. \n\nIt’s great to have the first two components, but what do they really mean? \n\nThis can be answered by exploring how they relate to each column using the loadings of each principal component. \n\n<code>data.pca$loadings[, 1:2]</code>\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290161/Loading_matrix_of_the_first_two_principal_components_a3a7c6522c.png">\n\nLoading matrix of the first two principal components\n\nThe loading matrix shows that the first principal component has high positive values for both red meat, white meat, eggs, and milk. \n\nHowever, the values for cereals, pulses, nuts and oilseeds, and fruits and vegetables are relatively negative. \n\nThis suggests that countries with a higher intake of animal protein are in excess, while countries with a lower intake are in deficit.\n\nWhen it comes to the second principal component, it has high negative values for fish, starchy foods, and fruits and vegetables.  This implies that the underlying countries’ diets are highly influenced by their location, such as coastal regions for fish, and inland regions for a diet rich in vegetables and potatoes.\n\n<h3 id="PrincipalCAtopic-22">Visualization of the principal components </h3>\nThe previous analysis of the loading matrix gave a good understanding of the relationship between each of the first two principal components and the attributes in the data. \n\nHowever, it might not be visually appealing. \n\nThere are a couple of standard visualization strategies that can help the user glean insight into the data, and this section aims to cover some of those approaches, starting with the scree plot.  \n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-23"><U+2003>Scree Plot</h4>\n\nThe first approach of the list is the scree plot. \n\nIt is used to visualize the importance of each principal component and can be used to determine the number of principal components to retain. \n\nThe scree plot can be generated using the <code>fviz_eig()</code> function. \n\n<code>fviz_eig(data.pca, addlabels = TRUE)</code>\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290160/Scree_plot_of_the_components_148bf98897.png">\n\nScree plot of the components\n\nThis plot shows the eigenvalues in a downward curve, from highest to lowest. \n\nThe first two components can be considered to be the most significant since they contain almost 89% of the total information of the data.\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-24"><U+2003>Biplot of the attributes</h4>\n\nWith the biplot, it is possible to visualize the similarities and dissimilarities between the samples, and further shows the impact of each attribute on each of the principal components.\n\n<code># Graph of the variables\n\nfviz_pca_var(data.pca, col.var = "black")</code>\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290161/Biplot_of_the_variables_dcf3eea254.png">\n\nBiplot of the variables with respect to the principal components\n\nThree main pieces of information can be observed from the previous plot. \n\nFirst, all the variables that are grouped together are positively correlated to each other, and that is the case  for instance for white/red meat, milk, and eggs have a positive correlation to each. \n\nThis result is surprising because they have the highest values in the loading matrix with respect to the first principal component.\n\nThen, the higher the distance between the variable and the origin, the better represented that variable is. \n\nFrom the biplot, eggs, milk, and white meat have higher magnitude compared to red meat, and hence are well represented compared to red meat.\n\nFinally, variables that are negatively correlated are displayed to the opposite sides of the biplot’s origin.<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-25"><U+2003>Contribution of each variable </h4>\n\nThe goal of the third visualization is to determine how much each variable is represented in a given component. \n\nSuch a quality of representation is called the Cos2 and corresponds to the square cosine, and it is computed using the <code>fviz_cos2</code> function.\n\nA low value means that the variable is not perfectly represented by that component.A high value, on the other hand, means a good representation of the variable on that component.\n\n<code>fviz_cos2(data.pca, choice = "var", axes = 1:2)</code>\n\nThe code above computed the square cosine value for each variable with respect to the first two principal components. \n\nFrom the illustration below, cereals, pulse nut oilseeds, eggs, and milk are the top four variables with the highest cos2, hence contributing the most to PC1 and PC2.\n\n<img loading="lazy" src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676290160/Variables_contribution_to_principal_components_ecfbe16df3.png">\n\nVariables’ contribution to principal components\n\n<h4 id="PrincipalCAtopic-26"><U+2003>Biplot combined with cos2 </h4>\n\nThe last two visualization approaches: biplot and attributes importance can be combined to create a single biplot, where attributes with similar cos2 scores will have similar colors.

space, and can be a good choice when you suspect there are “too many” variables.\nAn excess of variables, usually predictors, can be a problem because it is difficult to understand or visualize data in higher dimensions.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-0"><pk>What Problems Can Dimensionality Reduction Solve?</pk></h3>\nDimensionality reduction can be used either in feature engineering or in exploratory data analysis.\nFor example, in high-dimensional biology experiments, one of the first tasks, before any modeling, is to determine if there are any unwanted trends in the data (e.g., effects not related to the question of interest, such as lab-to-lab differences).\nDebugging the data is difficult when there are hundreds of thousands of dimensions, and dimensionality reduction can be an aid for exploratory data analysis.\nAnother potential consequence of having a multitude of predictors is possible harm to a model.\nThe simplest example is a method like ordinary linear regression where the number of predictors should be less than the number of data points used to fit the model.\nAnother issue is multicollinearity, where between-predictor correlations can negatively impact the mathematical operations used to estimate a model.\nIf there are an extremely large number of predictors, it is fairly unlikely that there are an equal number of real underlying effects.\nPredictors may be measuring the same latent effect(s), and thus such predictors will be highly correlated.\nMany dimensionality reduction techniques thrive in this situation.\nIn fact, most can be effective only when there are such relationships between predictors that can be exploited.\n\nWhen starting a new modeling project, reducing the dimensions of the data may provide some intuition about how hard the modeling problem may be.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most straightforward methods for reducing the number of columns in the data set because it relies on linear methods and is unsupervised (i.e., does not consider the outcome data).\nFor a high-dimensional classification problem, an initial plot of the main PCA components might show a clear separation between the classes.\nIf this is the case, then it is fairly safe to assume that a linear classifier might do a good job.\nHowever, the converse is not true; a lack of separation does not mean that the problem is insurmountable.\nThe dimensionality reduction methods discussed in this chapter are generally <k>not</k> feature selection methods.\nMethods such as PCA represent the original predictors using a smaller subset of new features.\nAll of the original predictors are required to compute these new features.\nThe exception to this are sparse methods that have the ability to completely remove the impact of predictors when creating the new features.\n\nThis chapter has two goals:\n\nDemonstrate how to use recipes to create a small set of features that capture the main aspects of the original predictor set.\nDescribe how recipes can be used on their own (as opposed to being used in a workflow object, as in Section 8.2).\n\nThe latter is helpful when testing or debugging a recipe.\nHowever, as described in Section 8.2, the best way to use a recipe for modeling is from within a workflow object.\nIn addition to the tidymodels package, this chapter uses the following packages: baguette, beans, bestNormalize, corrplot, discrim, embed, ggforce, klaR, learntidymodels,<sup>32</sup> mixOmics,<sup>33</sup> and uwot.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-1"><pk>A Picture Is Worth a Thousand… Beans</pk></h3>\nLet’s walk through how to use dimensionality reduction with recipes for an example data set.\nKoklu and Ozkan (2020) published a data set of visual characteristics of dried beans and described methods for determining the varieties of dried beans in an image.\nWhile the dimensionality of these data is not very large compared to many real-world modeling problems, it does provide a nice working example to demonstrate how to reduce the number of features.\nFrom their manuscript:\n<blockquote>\nThe primary objective of this study is to provide a method for obtaining uniform seed varieties from crop production, which is in the form of population, so the seeds are not certified as a sole variety.\nThus, a computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification.\nFor the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera.\n</blockquote>\nEach image contains multiple beans.\nThe process of determining which pixels correspond to a particular bean is called <k>image segmentation</k>.\nThese pixels can be analyzed to produce features for each bean, such as color and morphology (i.e., shape).\nThese features are then used to model the outcome (bean variety) because different bean varieties look different.\nThe training data come from a set of manually labeled images, and this data set is used to create a predictive model that can distinguish between seven bean varieties: Cali, Horoz, Dermason, Seker, Bombay, Barbunya, and Sira.\nProducing an effective model can help manufacturers quantify the homogeneity of a batch of beans.\nThere are numerous methods for quantifying shapes of objects (Mingqiang, Kidiyo, and Joseph 2008).\nMany are related to the boundaries or regions of the object of interest.\nExample of features include:\n\nThe <k>area</k> (or size) can be estimated using the number of pixels in the object or the size of the convex hull around the object.\nWe can measure the <k>perimeter</k> using the number of pixels in the boundary as well as the area of the bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing an object).\nThe <k>major axis</k> quantifies the longest line connecting the most extreme parts of the object.\nThe <k>minor axis</k> is perpendicular to the major axis.\nWe can measure the <k>compactness</k> of an object using the ratio of the object’s area to the area of a circle with the same perimeter.\nFor example, the symbols “<U+2022>” and “×” have very different compactness.\nThere are also different measures of how <k>elongated</k> or oblong an object is.\nFor example, the <k>eccentricity</k> statistic is the ratio of the major and minor axes.\nThere are also related estimates for roundness and convexity.\n\nNotice the eccentricity for the different shapes in Figure 16.1.\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/premade/morphology.svg">\n\nFigure 16.1: Some example shapes and their eccentricity statistics\n\nShapes such as circles and squares have low eccentricity while oblong shapes have high values.\nAlso, the metric is unaffected by the rotation of the object.\nMany of these image features have high correlations; objects with large areas are more likely to have large perimeters.\nThere are often multiple methods to quantify the same underlying characteristics (e.g., size).\nIn the bean data, 16 morphology features were computed: area, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, aspect ratio, eccentricity, convex area, equiv diameter, extent, solidity, roundness, compactness, shape factor 1, shape factor 2, shape factor 3, and shape factor 4.\nThe latter four are described in Symons and Fulcher (1988).\nWe can begin by loading the data:\nlibrary(tidymodels)\ntidymodels_prefer()\nlibrary(beans)\n\nIt is important to maintain good data discipline when evaluating dimensionality reduction techniques, especially if you will use them within a model.\n\nFor our analyses, we start by holding back a testing set with initial_split().\nThe remaining data are split into training and validation sets:\nset.seed(1601)\nbean_split &lt;- initial_validation_split(beans, strata = class, prop = c(0.75, 0.125))\n#> Warning: Too little data to stratify.\n#> <U+2022> Resampling will be unstratified.\nbean_split\n#> &lt;Training/Validation/Testing/Total>\n#> &lt;10206/1702/1703/13612>\n\n# Return data frames:\nbean_train &lt;- training(bean_split)\nbean_test &lt;- testing(bean_split)\nbean_validation &lt;- validation(bean_split)\n\nset.seed(1602)\n# Return an \'rset\' object to use with the tune functions:\nbean_val &lt;- validation_set(bean_split)\nbean_val$splits[[1]]\n#> &lt;Training/Validation/Total>\n#> &lt;10206/1702/11908>\nTo visually assess how well different methods perform, we can estimate the methods on the training set (n = 10,206 beans) and display the results using the validation set (n = 1,702).\nBefore beginning any dimensionality reduction, we can spend some time investigating our data.\nSince we know that many of these shape features are probably measuring similar concepts, let’s take a look at the correlation structure of the data in Figure 16.2 using this code.\nlibrary(corrplot)\ntmwr_cols &lt;- colorRampPalette(c("#91CBD765", "#CA225E"))\nbean_train %>% \n  select(-class) %>% \n  cor() %>% \n  corrplot(col = tmwr_cols("black", method = "ellipse")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/beans-corr-plot-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.2: Correlation matrix of the predictors with variables ordered via clustering\n\nMany of these predictors are highly correlated, such as area and perimeter or shape factors 2 and 3.\nWhile we don’t take the time to do it here, it is also important to see if this correlation structure significantly changes across the outcome categories.\nThis can help create better models.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-2"><pk>A Starter Recipe</pk></h3>\nIt’s time to look at the beans data in a smaller space.\nWe can start with a basic recipe to preprocess the data prior to any dimensionality reduction steps.\nSeveral predictors are ratios and so are likely to have skewed distributions.\nSuch distributions can wreak havoc on variance calculations (such as the ones used in PCA).\nThe bestNormalize package has a step that can enforce a symmetric distribution for the predictors.\nWe’ll use this to mitigate the issue of skewed distributions:\nlibrary(bestNormalize)\nbean_rec &lt;-\n  # Use the training data from the bean_val split object\n  recipe(class ~ ., data = bean_train) %>%\n  step_zv(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%\n  step_orderNorm(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% \n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())\n\nRemember that when invoking the recipe() function, the steps are not estimated or executed in any way.\n\nThis recipe will be extended with additional steps for the dimensionality reduction analyses.\nBefore doing so, let’s go over how a recipe can be used outside of a workflow.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-3"><pk>Recipes in the Wild</pk></h3>\nAs mentioned in Section 8.2, a workflow containing a recipe uses fit() to estimate the recipe and model, then predict() to process the data and make model predictions.\nThere are analogous functions in the recipes package that can be used for the same purpose:\n\nprep(recipe, training) fits the recipe to the training set.\nbake(recipe, new_data) applies the recipe operations to new_data.\n\nFigure 16.3 summarizes this.\nLet’s look at each of these functions in more detail.\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/premade/recipes-process.svg">\n\nFigure 16.3: Summary of recipe-related functions\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-4">Preparing a recipe</h3>\nLet’s estimate bean_rec using the training set data, with prep(bean_rec):\nbean_rec_trained &lt;- prep(bean_rec)\nbean_rec_trained\n#> \n#> ── Recipe ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> \n#> ── Inputs\n#> Number of variables by role\n#> outcome:    1\n#> predictor: 16\n#> \n#> ── Training information\n#> Training data contained 10206 data points and no incomplete rows.\n#> \n#> ──

scaling for: area, perimeter, major_axis_length, ...\n| Trained\n\nRemember that prep() for a recipe is like fit() for a model.\n\nNote in the output that the steps have been trained and that the selectors are no longer general (i.e., all_numeric_predictors()); they now show the actual columns that were selected.\nAlso, prep(bean_rec) does not require the training argument.\nYou can pass any data into that argument, but omitting it means that the original data from the call to recipe() will be used.\nIn our case, this was the training set data.\nOne important argument to prep() is retain.\nWhen retain = TRUE (the default), the estimated version of the training set is kept within the recipe.\nThis data set has been pre-processed using all of the steps listed in the recipe.\nSince prep() has to execute the recipe as it proceeds, it may be advantageous to keep this version of the training set so that, if that data set is to be used later, redundant calculations can be avoided.\nHowever, if the training set is big, it may be problematic to keep such a large amount of data in memory.\nUse retain = FALSE to avoid this.\nOnce new steps are added to this estimated recipe, reapplying prep() will estimate only the untrained steps.\nThis will come in handy when we try different feature extraction methods.\n\nIf you encounter errors when working with a recipe, prep() can be used with its verbose option to troubleshoot:\n\nbean_rec_trained %>% \n  step_dummy(cornbread) %>%  # &lt;- not a real predictor\n  prep(verbose = TRUE)\n#> oper 1 step zv

Can\'t subset columns that don\'t exist.\n#> <U+2716> Column \ncornbread\n doesn\'t exist.\nAnother option that can help you understand what happens in the analysis is log_changes:\nshow_variables &lt;- \n  bean_rec %>% \n  prep(log_changes = TRUE)\n#> step_zv (zv_RLYwH): same number of columns\n#> \n#> step_orderNorm (orderNorm_Jx8oD): same number of columns\n#> \n#> step_normalize (normalize_GU75D): same number of columns\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-5">Baking the recipe</h3>\n\nUsing bake() with a recipe is much like using predict() with a model; the operations estimated from the training set are applied to any data, like testing data or new data at prediction time.\n\nFor example, the validation set samples can be processed:\nbean_val_processed &lt;- bake(bean_rec_trained, new_data = bean_validation)\nFigure 16.4 shows histograms of the area predictor before and after the recipe was prepared.\nlibrary(patchwork)\np1 &lt;- \n  bean_validation %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = area)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = "white", fill = "blue", alpha = \n  ggtitle("Original validation set data")\n\np2 &lt;- \n  bean_val_processed %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = area)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = "white", fill = "red", alpha = \n  ggtitle("Processed validation set data")\n\np1 + p2\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/bean-area-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.4: The area predictor before and after preprocessing\n\nTwo important aspects of bake() are worth noting here.\nFirst, as previously mentioned, using prep(recipe, retain = TRUE) keeps the existing processed version of the training set in the recipe.\nThis enables the user to use bake(recipe, new_data = NULL), which returns that data set without further computations.\nFor example:\nbake(bean_rec_trained, new_data = NULL) %>% nrow()\n#> [1] 10206\nbean_train %>% nrow()\n#> [1] 10206\nIf the training set is not pathologically large, using this value of retain can save a lot of computational time.\nSecond, additional selectors can be used in the call to specify which columns to return.\nThe default selector is everything(), but more specific directives can be used.\nWe will use prep() and bake() in the next section to illustrate some of these options.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-6"><pk>Feature Extraction Techniques</pk></h3>\nSince recipes are the primary option in tidymodels for dimensionality reduction, let’s write a function that will estimate the transformation and plot the resulting data in a scatter plot matrix via the ggforce package:\nlibrary(ggforce)\nplot_validation_results &lt;- function(recipe, dat = bean_validation) {\n  recipe %>%\n    # Estimate any additional steps\n    prep() %>%\n    # Process the data (the validation set by default)\n    bake(new_data = dat) %>%\n    # Create the scatterplot matrix\n    ggplot(aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y, color = class, fill = class)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_autodensity(alpha = .3) +\n    facet_matrix(vars(-class), layer.diag = \n    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + \n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")\n}\nWe will reuse this function several times in this chapter.\nA series of several feature extraction methodologies are explored here.\nAn overview of most can be found in Section 6.3.1 of M.\nKuhn and Johnson (2020) and the references therein.\nThe UMAP method is described in McInnes, Healy, and Melville (2020).\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-7">Principal component analysis</h3>\nWe’ve mentioned PCA several times already in this book, and it’s time to go into more detail.\nPCA is an unsupervised method that uses linear combinations of the predictors to define new features.\nThese features attempt to account for as much variation as possible in the original data.\nWe add step_pca() to the original recipe and use our function to visualize the results on the validation set in Figure 16.5 using:\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_pca(all_numeric_predictors(), num_comp = 4) %>%\n  plot_validation_results() + \n  ggtitle("Principal Component Analysis")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/bean-pca-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.5: Principal component scores for the bean validation set, colored by class\n\nWe see that the first two components PC1 and PC2, especially when used together, do an effective job distinguishing between or separating the classes.\nThis may lead us to expect that the overall problem of classifying these beans will not be especially difficult.\nRecall that PCA is unsupervised.\nFor these data, it turns out that the PCA components that explain the most variation in the predictors also happen to be predictive of the classes.\nWhat features are driving performance? The learntidymodels package has functions that can help visualize the top features for each component.\nWe’ll need the prepared recipe; the PCA step is added in the following code along with a call to prep():\nlibrary(learntidymodels)\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_pca(all_numeric_predictors(), num_comp = \n  prep() %>% \n  plot_top_loadings(component_number &lt;= \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +\n  ggtitle("Principal Component Analysis")\nThis produces Figure 16.6.\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/pca-loadings-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.6: Predictor loadings for the PCA transformation\n\nThe top loadings are mostly related to the cluster of correlated predictors shown in the top-left portion of the previous correlation plot: perimeter, area, major axis length, and convex area.\nThese are all related to bean size.\nShape factor 2, from Symons and Fulcher (1988), is the area over the cube of the major axis length and is therefore also related to bean size.\nMeasures of elongation appear to dominate the second PCA component.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-8">Partial least squares</h3>\nPLS, which we introduced in Section 13.5.1, is a supervised version of PCA.\nIt tries to find components that simultaneously maximize the variation in the predictors while also maximizing the relationship between those components and the outcome.\nFigure 16.7 shows the results of this slightly modified version of the PCA code:\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_pls(all_numeric_predictors(), outcome = "class", num_comp = 4) %>%\n  plot_validation_results() + \n  ggtitle("Partial Least Squares")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/bean-pls-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.7: PLS component scores for the bean validation set, colored by class\n\nThe first two PLS components plotted in Figure 16.7 are nearly identical to the first two PCA components! We find this result because those PCA components are so effective at separating the varieties of beans.\nThe remaining components are different.\nFigure 16.8 visualizes the loadings, the top features for each component.\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_pls(all_numeric_predictors(), outcome = "class", num_comp = 4) %>%\n  prep() %>% \n  plot_top_loadings(component_number &lt;= "pls") + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +\n  ggtitle("Partial Least Squares")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/pls-loadings-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.8: Predictor loadings for the PLS transformation\n\nSolidity (i.e., the density of the bean) drives the third PLS component, along with roundness.\nSolidity may be capturing bean features related to “bumpiness” of the bean surface since it can measure irregularity of the bean boundaries.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-9">Independent component analysis</h3>\nICA is slightly different than PCA in that it finds components that are as statistically independent from one another as possible (as opposed to being uncorrelated).\nIt can be thought of as maximizing the “non-Gaussianity” of the ICA components, or separating information instead of compressing information like PCA.\nLet’s use step_ica() to produce Figure 16.9:\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_ica(all_numeric_predictors(), num_comp = 4) %>%\n  plot_validation_results() + \n  ggtitle("Independent Component Analysis")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/bean-ica-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.9: ICA component scores for the bean validation set, colored by class\n\nInspecting this plot, there does not appear to be much separation between the classes in the first few components when using ICA.\nThese independent (or as independent as possible) components do not separate the bean types.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-10">Uniform manifold approximation and projection</h3>\nUMAP is similar to the popular t-SNE method for nonlinear dimension reduction.\nIn the original high-dimensional space, UMAP uses a distance-based nearest neighbor method to find local areas of the data where the data points are more likely to be related.\nThe relationship between data points is saved as a directed graph model where most points are not connected.\nFrom there, UMAP translates points in the graph to the reduced dimensional space.\nTo do this, the algorithm has an optimization process that uses cross-entropy to map data points to the smaller set of features so that the graph is well approximated.\nTo create the mapping, the embed package contains a step function for this method, visualized in Figure 16.10.\nlibrary(embed)\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_umap(all_numeric_predictors(), num_comp = 4) %>%\n  plot_validation_results() +\n  ggtitle("UMAP")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/bean-umap-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.10: UMAP component scores for the bean validation set, colored by class\n\nWhile the between-cluster space is pronounced, the clusters can contain a heterogeneous mixture of classes.\nThere is also a supervised version of UMAP:\nbean_rec_trained %>%\n  step_umap(all_numeric_predictors(), outcome = "class", num_comp = 4) %>%\n  plot_validation_results() +\n  ggtitle("UMAP (supervised)")\n\n<img src="https://www.tmwr.org/16-dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/bean-umap-supervised-1.png">\n\nFigure 16.11: Supervised UMAP component scores for the bean validation set, colored by class\n\nThe supervised method shown in Figure 16.11 looks promising for modeling the data.\nUMAP is a powerful method to reduce the feature space.\nHowever, it can be very sensitive to tuning parameters (e.g., the number of neighbors and so on).\nFor this reason, it would help to experiment with a few of the parameters to assess how robust the results are for these data.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-11"><pk>Modeling</pk></h3>\nBoth the PLS and UMAP methods are worth investigating in conjunction with different models.\nLet’s explore a variety of different models with these dimensionality reduction techniques (along with no transformation at all): a single layer neural network, bagged trees, flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), naive Bayes, and regularized discriminant analysis (RDA).\nNow that we are back in “modeling mode,” we’ll create a series of model specifications and then use a workflow set to tune the models in the following code.\nNote that the model parameters are tuned in conjunction with the recipe parameters (e.g., size of the reduced dimension, UMAP parameters).\nlibrary(baguette)\nlibrary(discrim)\n\nmlp_spec &lt;-\n  mlp(hidden_units = tune(), penalty = tune(), epochs = tune()) %>%\n  set_engine(\'nnet\') %>%\n  set_mode(\'classification\')\n\nbagging_spec &lt;-\n  bag_tree() %>%\n  set_engine(\'rpart\') %>%\n

frac_identity = tune()) %>%\n  set_engine(\'klaR\')\n\nbayes_spec &lt;-\n  naive_Bayes() %>%\n  set_engine(\'klaR\')\nWe also need recipes for the dimensionality reduction methods we’ll try.\nLet’s start with a base recipe bean_rec and then extend it with different dimensionality reduction steps:\nbean_rec &lt;-\n  recipe(class ~ ., data = bean_train) %>%\n  step_zv(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%\n  step_orderNorm(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())\n\npls_rec &lt;- \n  bean_rec %>% \n  step_pls(all_numeric_predictors(), outcome = "class", num_comp = tune())\n\numap_rec &lt;-\n  bean_rec %>%\n  step_umap(\n    all_numeric_predictors(),\n    outcome = "class",\n    num_comp = tune(),\n    neighbors = tune(),\n    min_dist = tune()\n  )\nOnce again, the workflowsets package takes the preprocessors and models and crosses them.\nThe control option parallel_over is set so that the parallel processing can work simultaneously across tuning parameter combinations.\nThe workflow_map() function applies grid search to optimize the model/preprocessing parameters (if any) across 10 parameter combinations.\nThe multiclass area under the ROC curve is estimated on the validation set.\nctrl &lt;- control_grid(parallel_over = "everything")\nbean_res &lt;- \n  workflow_set(\n    preproc = list(basic = class ~., pls = pls_rec, umap = umap_rec), \n

We’ll use this model in the next chapter to demonstrate variable importance methods.\n\n<h3 id="Dimensionalitytopic-12"><pk>Chapter Summary</pk></h3>\nDimensionality reduction can be a helpful method for exploratory data analysis as well as modeling.\nThe recipes and embed packages contain steps for a variety of different methods and workflowsets facilitates choosing an appropriate method for a data set.\nThis chapter also discussed how recipes can be used on their own, either for debugging problems with a recipe or directly for exploratory data analysis and data visualization.\n',

quantile regression”的方法可以根据训练数据中观察到的情况适当地调整区间的宽度。\n这种方法首先拟合一个分位数回归模型，并需要一个分割的数据集，比如校准数据。\n但在tidymodels中，可以使用分位数回归森林（quantile regression forests），因为一些模型需要非线性项、交互作用和其他特性来充分模拟数据。\n随机森林用于分位数回归适应性强，维护成本低，并且对调整参数的设定具有鲁棒性。\n这种分析的函数int_conformal_quantile()与之前的函数接口略有不同。\n它需要训练集和校准集，并且必须提前设定置信水平。\n下面将向quantregForest()函数传递一个参数，使用2000棵树来构建森林。\np_load(quantregForest)\nquant_int

与神经网络不同，分位数回归森林模型在预测时会延续其在训练集上观察到的趋势，即使这些趋势在新的数据点上可能不再适用。\n\n------------\n\n<a target="_blank"

Clustering in different fields</pk></a></div></center>\n\n\nIn real world, not every data we work upon has a target variable.\nThis kind of data cannot be analyzed using supervised learning algorithms.\nWe need the help of unsupervised algorithms.\n\nOne of the most popular type of analysis under unsupervised learning is Cluster analysis.\n\nWhen the goal is to group similar data points in a dataset, then we use cluster analysis.\n\nIn practical situations, we can use cluster analysis for customer segmentation for targeted advertisements, or in medical imaging to find unknown or new infected areas and many more use cases that we will discuss further in this article.\n\n<h3 id="Clusteringtopic-0"><pk>What is Clustering ?</pk></h3>\nThis method is defined under the branch of Unsupervised Learning, which aims at gaining insights from unlabelled data points, that is, unlike supervised learning we don’t have a target variable.\n\nClustering aims at forming groups of homogeneous data points from a heterogeneous dataset.\n\nIt evaluates the similarity based on a metric like Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity, Manhattan distance, etc.\n\nand then group the points with highest similarity score together.\n\nFor Example, In the graph given below, we can clearly see that there are 3 circular clusters forming on the basis of distance.\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/merge3cluster.jpg">\n\nNow it is not necessary that the clusters formed must be circular in shape.\n\nThe shape of clusters can be arbitrary.\n\nThere are many algortihms that work well with detecting arbitrary shaped clusters.\n\nFor example, In the below given graph we can see that the clusters formed are not circular in shape.\n\n<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/clusteringg.jpg">\n\n<h3 id="Clusteringtopic-1"><pk>Types of Clustering</pk></h3>\nBroadly speaking, there are 2 types of clustering that can be performed to group similar data points:\n\n<k id="Clusteringtopic-2">Hard Clustering: </k>In this type of clustering, each data point belongs to a cluster completely or not.\n\nFor example, Let’s say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters.\n\nSo each data point will either belong to cluster 1 or cluster 2.\n\nData Points	Clusters\nA		C1\nB		C2\nC		C2\nD		C1\n\n<k id="Clusteringtopic-3">Soft Clustering: </k>In this type of clustering, instead of assigning each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that point being that cluster is evaluated.\n\nFor example, Let’s say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters.\n\nSo we will be evaluating a probability of a data point belonging to both clusters.\n\nThis probability is calculated for all data points.\n\nData Points	Probability of C1	Probability of C2\nA			0.91				0.09\nB			0.3				0.7\nC			0.17				0.83\nD			1				0\n\n<h3 id="Clusteringtopic-4"><pk>Uses of Clustering</pk></h3>\nNow before we begin with types of clustering algorithms, we will go through the use cases of Clustering algorithms.\n\nClustering algorithms are majorly used for:\nMarket Segmentation – Businesses use clustering to group their customers and use targeted advertisements to attract more audience.\n\nMarket Basket Analysis – Shop owners analyze their sales and figure out which items are majorly bought together by the customers.\n\nFor example, In USA, according to a study diapers and beers were usually bought together by fathers.\n\nSocial Network Analysis – Social media sites use your data to understand your browsing behaviour and provide you with targeted friend recommendations or content recommendations.\n\nMedical Imaging – Doctors use Clustering to find out diseased areas in diagnostic images like X-rays.\n\nAnomaly Detection – To find outliers in a stream of real-time dataset or forecasting fraudulent transactions we can use clustering to identify them.\n\nSimplify working with large datasets – Each cluster is given a cluster ID after clustering is complete.\n\nNow, you may reduce a feature set’s whole feature set into its cluster ID.\n\nClustering is effective when it can represent a complicated case with a straightforward cluster ID.\n\nUsing the same principle, clustering data can make complex datasets simpler.\n\nThere are many more use cases for clustering but there are some of the major and common use cases of clustering.\n\nMoving forward we will be discussing Clustering Algorithms that will help you perform the above tasks.\n\n<h3 id="Clusteringtopic-5"><pk>Types of Clustering Algorithms</pk></h3>\nAt the surface level, clustering helps in the analysis of unstructured data.\n\nGraphing, the shortest distance, and the density of the data points are a few of the elements that influence cluster formation.\n\nClustering is the process of determining how related the objects are based on a metric called the similarity measure.\n\nSimilarity metrics are easier to locate in smaller sets of features.\n\nIt gets harder to create similarity measures as the number of features increases.\n\nDepending on the type of clustering algorithm being utilized in data mining, several techniques are employed to group the data from the datasets.\n\nIn this part, the clustering techniques are described.\n\nVarious types of clustering algorithms are:\n\nCentroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods)\n\nDensity-based Clustering (Model-based methods)\n\nConnectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)\n\nDistribution-based Clustering\n\nWe will be going through each of these types in brief.\n\n<h4 id="Clusteringtopic-6">1.Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods)</h4>\n\nPartitioning methods are the most easiest clustering algorithms.\n\nThey group data points on the basis of their closeness.\n\nGenerally, the similarity measure chosen for these algorithms are Euclidian distance, Manhattan Distance or Minkowski Distance.\n\nThe datasets are separated into a predetermined number of clusters, and each cluster is referenced by a vector of values.\n\nWhen compared to the vector value, the input data variable shows no difference and joins the cluster.\n\nThe primary drawback for these algorithms is the requirement that we establish the number of clusters, “k,” either intuitively or scientifically (using the Elbow Method) before any clustering machine learning system starts allocating the data points.\n\nDespite this, it is still the most popular type of clustering.\n\nK-means and K-medoids clustering are some examples of this type clustering.\n\n<h4 id="Clusteringtopic-7">2.Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods)</h4>\n\nDensity-based clustering, a model-based method, finds groups based on the density of data points.\n\nContrary to centroid-based clustering, which requires that the number of clusters be predefined and is sensitive to initialization, density-based clustering determines the number of clusters automatically and is less susceptible to beginning positions.\n\nThey are great at handling clusters of different sizes and forms, making them ideally suited for datasets with irregularly shaped or overlapping clusters.\n\nThese methods manage both dense and sparse data regions by focusing on local density and can distinguish clusters with a variety of morphologies.\n\nIn contrast, centroid-based grouping, like k-means, has trouble finding arbitrary shaped clusters.\n\nDue to its preset number of cluster requirements and extreme sensitivity to the initial positioning of centroids, the outcomes can vary.\n\nFurthermore, the tendency of centroid-based approaches to produce spherical or convex clusters restricts their capacity to handle complicated or irregularly shaped clusters.\n\nIn conclusion, density-based clustering overcomes the drawbacks of centroid-based techniques by autonomously choosing cluster sizes, being resilient to initialization, and successfully capturing clusters of various sizes and forms.\n\nThe most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN.\n\n<h4 id="Clusteringtopic-8">3.Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)</h4>\n\nA method for assembling related data points into hierarchical clusters is called hierarchical clustering.\n\nEach data point is initially taken into account as a separate cluster, which is subsequently combined with the clusters that are the most similar to form one large cluster that contains all of the data points.\n\nThink about how you may arrange a collection of items based on how similar they are.\n\nEach object begins as its own cluster at the base of the tree when using hierarchical clustering, which creates a dendrogram, a tree-like structure.\n\nThe closest pairings of clusters are then combined into larger clusters after the algorithm examines how similar the objects are to one another.\n\nWhen every object is in one cluster at the top of the tree, the merging process has finished.\n\nExploring various granularity levels is one of the fun things about hierarchical clustering.\n\nTo obtain a given number of clusters, you can select to cut the dendrogram at a particular height.\n\nThe more similar two objects are within a cluster, the closer they are.\n\nIt’s comparable to classifying items according to their family trees, where the nearest relatives are clustered together and the wider branches signify more general connections.\n\nThere are 2 approaches for Hierarchical clustering:\n\n<k id="Clusteringtopic-9"><U+2003>Divisive Clustering</k>\nIt follows a top-down approach, here we consider all data points to be part one big cluster and then this cluster is divide into smaller groups.\n\n<k id="Clusteringtopic-10"><U+2003>Agglomerative Clustering</k>\nIt follows a bottom-up approach, here we consider all data points to be part of individual clusters and then these clusters are clubbed together to make one big cluster with all data points.\n\n<h4 id="Clusteringtopic-11">4.Distribution-based Clustering</h4>\nUsing distribution-based clustering, data points are generated and organized according to their propensity to fall into the same probability distribution (such as a Gaussian, binomial, or other) within the data.\n\nThe data elements are grouped using a probability-based distribution that is based on statistical distributions.\n\nIncluded are data objects that have a higher likelihood of being in the cluster.\n\nA data point is less likely to be included in a cluster the further it is from the cluster’s central point, which exists in every cluster.\n\nA notable drawback of density and boundary-based approaches is the need to specify the clusters a priori for some algorithms, and primarily the definition of the cluster form for the bulk of algorithms.\n\nThere must be at least one tuning or hyper-parameter selected, and while doing so should be simple, getting it wrong could have unanticipated repercussions.\n\nDistribution-based clustering has a definite advantage over proximity and centroid-based clustering approaches in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and cluster structure.\n\nThe key issue is that, in order to avoid overfitting, many clustering methods only work with simulated or manufactured data, or when the bulk of the data points certainly belong to a preset distribution.\n\nThe most popular distribution-based clustering algorithm is Gaussian Mixture Model.\n\n<h3 id="Clusteringtopic-12"><pk>Applications of Clustering in different

significantly influence clustering results - the solution is to preprocess the data or use density-based clustering\nSome methods are not suited for large (or high-dimensional) datasets - model-based or spectral clustering\nSome methods are not suited for non-convex clusters - K-means, basic hierarchical clustering\n\n',
