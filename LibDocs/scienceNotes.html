'<h2>光刻机 和 刻蚀机</h2><br>外行容易混淆“光刻机”和“刻蚀机”。<br>光刻机相当于画匠，刻蚀机是雕工。<br>前者投影在硅片上一张精细的电路图(就像照相机让胶卷感光)，后者按这张图去刻线(就像刻印章一样，腐蚀和去除不需要的部分)。<br>光刻机是芯片制造中用到的最金贵的机器，要达到5纳米曝光精度难比登天，ASML公司一家通吃高端光刻机；<br>而刻蚀机没那么难，中微的竞争对手还有应用材料、泛林、东京电子等等，国外巨头体量优势明显。<br>但现在的刻蚀机精度已远超光刻机的曝光精度；<br>刻蚀是制造环节的工序之一，还有造晶棒、切割晶圆、涂膜、光刻、掺杂、测试等等，都需要复杂的技术。<br>中国在大部分工序上落后。”<br>',
'<h2>If sand is eroded rock caused by water, then how are deserts made entirely of sand, but still some of the driest places on Earth?</h2><br><b>The idea that deserts consist entirely of sand is erroneous. </b>Yes, people <br><i>expect</i> deserts to consist entirely of sand dunes. <br>This results in deserts being <br><i>depicted</i> in visual media (photos, TV, movies) as consisting of just sand dunes, so people will be satisfied that they’re seeing a desert. <br>In other words, it’s a self-perpetuating fallacy.<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8ac2ce4c2499f008fc297981d0dc8100"><br>The following discussion excludes polar deserts such as Antarctica.<br>In actuality, the Sahara, the largest desert on earth, is only 15% sand dunes. <br>The deserts of North America collectively add up to just 2% sand dunes. <br>The percentage of sand dunes varies among other deserts around the world but the overall average is 20 percent (<br><br><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/features/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 161386883);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="usgs.gov">Desert Features</a></span> ).<br>As noted by others, sand can be created by wind erosion as well as by water erosion. <br>In addition, over geologic time climates don’t stay the same; an area that is desert now wasn’t always desert in the past. <br>Many thousands of years ago the western portion of the Sahara had soil and savanna-type vegetation (scattered trees in grassland). <br>The climate dried out and <br><i>desertification</i> happened.<br>A similar process occurred in the Mojave Desert in California after the end of the last ice age. <br>Desert mountains lost their woodlands and brush, and the soil washed off into the valleys and plains below.<br>When desertification happens, the vegetation that stabilizes the soil is largely lost and soil becomes vulnerable to wind erosion. <br>Soil contains three size classes of relatively fine particles: sand, silt, and clay. <br>Of these three, silt is the most easily mobilized by wind and water, and over time is mostly blown out of the desert to surrounding areas. <br>Clay is mobilized by the occasional floods that hit even desert areas, and mostly ends up in dry lake beds.<br>After silt is mostly blown away and clay washed away, then sand, gravel, and rock are what are left across most of a desert’s surface. <br>Sand is easily blown by the wind, but not to the same distances as silt. <br>As a result it collects in limited areas to form dunes, which are located where there is net sand transport arriving from multiple directions. <br>Gravel doesn’t move much unless carried by a flood, and rock almost entirely stays put except for the slow process of erosion.<br>The result is that deserts end up having primarily the following kinds of landscapes:<br>Bare rock<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99c8c3c885204bbea2eda9a45685488b"><br>Gravel plains, perhaps with finer particles under the gravel and protected by it.<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ffc429da3ae62752a32a1ac687b64954"><br>Sand dunes, located where prevailing winds cancel out and sand accumulates<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-19e1a4a8fce5cfd194502b9c4e331aea"><br>Dry stream beds consisting of sand and gravel. <br>These carry water occasionally for brief periods<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-80acc4b07de695ba3b92e9d9c4c79eb1"><br>Dry lake beds consisting of clay, and often salt<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e57e264500fd0a575939dbb89510e99"><br>Mud hills, consisting of uplifted lake beds subsequently eroded into badlands<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-75fdb42744bf7e7dabc9ba67ca39685b"><br>',
'<h2>Different Types of Soil &#8211; Sand, Silt, Clay and Loam 壤土</h2><br>Soil can be defined in many ways. <br>In civil engineering, soil is a naturally occurring, loose/un-cemented/weakly cemented/relatively unconsolidated mineral particles, organic or inorganic in character, lying over the bed rock which is formed by weathering of rocks. <br>Soil is formed by different particels such as gravel, rock, sand, silt, clay, loam and humus.<br><br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sand-silt-clay.jpg"><br><br>Fig 1: Sand Silt and Clay.<br><br>In this article we discuss on properties, characteristics, size, shape and constituents of  least sized soil types namely sand, silt, clay and loam.<br><h3><strong>1. Sand</strong></h3>It is most extensively used construction material. <br>It consists of particles of rock and hard minerals, such as silicon dioxide. <br>They are the largest type of soil particles, where each particle is visible to naked eye. <br>The large, relatively stable sand-particle size increases soil aeration, improves drainage in tight soils and creates plant-growth supporting qualities, or tilt.<br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sand-696x464.jpg"><br>Fig 2 : Sand<br><br>The particle size of course sand ranges from 2 &#8211; 4.75mm, Medium sand ranges from 0.425 &#8211; 2 mm and fine sand ranges from 0.075 &#8211; 0.425 mm. <br>The bigger particle size of the sand gives wet or dry sandy soil a grainy texture when you rub it between your fingers, and it makes the soil light and crumbly even when you try to stick it together in your hand. <br>The particle shape is angular, sub angular, rounded, flat or elongated. <br>The texture is rough, smooth, or polished.<br><h3><strong>2. Silt</strong></h3>Silt is a sediment material with an intermediate size between sand and clay. <br>Carried by water during flood it forms a fertile deposit on valleys floor. <br>The particle size of silt ranges from  0.002 and 0.06 mm.<br><br><br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/silt-soil.jpg"><br>Fig 3: Silt in wet condition<br><br>Silt is a non plastic or low plasticity material due to its fineness. <br>Due to its fineness, when wet it becomes a smooth mud that you can form easily into balls or other shapes in your hand and when silt soil is very wet, it blends seamlessly with water to form fine, runny puddles of mud.<br><h3><strong>3. Clay </strong></h3>Clay particles are the finest of all the soil particles, measuring fewer than 0.002 mm in size. <br>It consists of microscopic and sub-microscopic particles derived from the chemical decomposition of rocks. <br>Clay is a fine grained cohesive soil. <br>They stick together readily and form a sticky or gluey texture when they are wet or dry.<br><br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Clay-696x464.jpg"><br>Fig 4: Clay when mixed with water<br><br>Clay is made of over 25 percent clay, and because of the spaces found between clay particles, clay soils hold a high amount of water. <br>Clay expand when in contact with water and shrink when getting dry. <br>Compared to sand particles, which are generally round, clay particles are thin, flat and covered with tiny plates. <br>Organic clay is highly compressible and its strength is very high when dry, which is why it is used in construction as mud mortar.<br><h3><strong>4. Loam </strong></h3>Loam is a mixture of clay, sand and silt and benefits from the qualities of these 3 different textures, favouring water retention, air circulation, drainage and fertility. <br>These soils are fertile, easy to work with and provide good drainage. <br>Depending on their predominant composition they can be either sandy or clay loam.<br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/loam.jpg"><br>Fig 5: Loam<br><br>The way the other particles combine in the soil makes the loam. <br>For instance, a soil that is 30 percent clay, 50 percent sand and 20 percent silt is a sandy clay loam, with the soil types before &#8220;loam&#8221; listed in the order their particles are most dominant in the loam. <br>The labels “clay loam,” “silt loam” and “sand loam” are used to refer to soils that are composed predominantly of those ingredients.<br>',
