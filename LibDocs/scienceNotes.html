'<h2>If sand is eroded rock caused by water, then how are deserts made entirely of sand, but still some of the driest places on Earth?</h2><br><b>The idea that deserts consist entirely of sand is erroneous. </b>Yes, people <br><i>expect</i> deserts to consist entirely of sand dunes. <br>This results in deserts being <br><i>depicted</i> in visual media (photos, TV, movies) as consisting of just sand dunes, so people will be satisfied that they’re seeing a desert. <br>In other words, it’s a self-perpetuating fallacy.<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8ac2ce4c2499f008fc297981d0dc8100"><br>The following discussion excludes polar deserts such as Antarctica.<br>In actuality, the Sahara, the largest desert on earth, is only 15% sand dunes. <br>The deserts of North America collectively add up to just 2% sand dunes. <br>The percentage of sand dunes varies among other deserts around the world but the overall average is 20 percent (<br><br><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/features/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 161386883);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="usgs.gov">Desert Features</a></span> ).<br>As noted by others, sand can be created by wind erosion as well as by water erosion. <br>In addition, over geologic time climates don’t stay the same; an area that is desert now wasn’t always desert in the past. <br>Many thousands of years ago the western portion of the Sahara had soil and savanna-type vegetation (scattered trees in grassland). <br>The climate dried out and <br><i>desertification</i> happened.<br>A similar process occurred in the Mojave Desert in California after the end of the last ice age. <br>Desert mountains lost their woodlands and brush, and the soil washed off into the valleys and plains below.<br>When desertification happens, the vegetation that stabilizes the soil is largely lost and soil becomes vulnerable to wind erosion. <br>Soil contains three size classes of relatively fine particles: sand, silt, and clay. <br>Of these three, silt is the most easily mobilized by wind and water, and over time is mostly blown out of the desert to surrounding areas. <br>Clay is mobilized by the occasional floods that hit even desert areas, and mostly ends up in dry lake beds.<br>After silt is mostly blown away and clay washed away, then sand, gravel, and rock are what are left across most of a desert’s surface. <br>Sand is easily blown by the wind, but not to the same distances as silt. <br>As a result it collects in limited areas to form dunes, which are located where there is net sand transport arriving from multiple directions. <br>Gravel doesn’t move much unless carried by a flood, and rock almost entirely stays put except for the slow process of erosion.<br>The result is that deserts end up having primarily the following kinds of landscapes:<br>Bare rock<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99c8c3c885204bbea2eda9a45685488b"><br>Gravel plains, perhaps with finer particles under the gravel and protected by it.<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ffc429da3ae62752a32a1ac687b64954"><br>Sand dunes, located where prevailing winds cancel out and sand accumulates<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-19e1a4a8fce5cfd194502b9c4e331aea"><br>Dry stream beds consisting of sand and gravel. <br>These carry water occasionally for brief periods<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-80acc4b07de695ba3b92e9d9c4c79eb1"><br>Dry lake beds consisting of clay, and often salt<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e57e264500fd0a575939dbb89510e99"><br>Mud hills, consisting of uplifted lake beds subsequently eroded into badlands<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-75fdb42744bf7e7dabc9ba67ca39685b"><br>',
'<h2>Different Types of Soil &#8211; Sand, Silt, Clay and Loam 壤土</h2><br>Soil can be defined in many ways. <br>In civil engineering, soil is a naturally occurring, loose/un-cemented/weakly cemented/relatively unconsolidated mineral particles, organic or inorganic in character, lying over the bed rock which is formed by weathering of rocks. <br>Soil is formed by different particels such as gravel, rock, sand, silt, clay, loam and humus.<br><br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sand-silt-clay.jpg"><br><br>Fig 1: Sand Silt and Clay.<br><br>In this article we discuss on properties, characteristics, size, shape and constituents of  least sized soil types namely sand, silt, clay and loam.<br><h3><strong>1. Sand</strong></h3>It is most extensively used construction material. <br>It consists of particles of rock and hard minerals, such as silicon dioxide. <br>They are the largest type of soil particles, where each particle is visible to naked eye. <br>The large, relatively stable sand-particle size increases soil aeration, improves drainage in tight soils and creates plant-growth supporting qualities, or tilt.<br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sand-696x464.jpg"><br>Fig 2 : Sand<br><br>The particle size of course sand ranges from 2 &#8211; 4.75mm, Medium sand ranges from 0.425 &#8211; 2 mm and fine sand ranges from 0.075 &#8211; 0.425 mm. <br>The bigger particle size of the sand gives wet or dry sandy soil a grainy texture when you rub it between your fingers, and it makes the soil light and crumbly even when you try to stick it together in your hand. <br>The particle shape is angular, sub angular, rounded, flat or elongated. <br>The texture is rough, smooth, or polished.<br><h3><strong>2. Silt</strong></h3>Silt is a sediment material with an intermediate size between sand and clay. <br>Carried by water during flood it forms a fertile deposit on valleys floor. <br>The particle size of silt ranges from  0.002 and 0.06 mm.<br><br><br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/silt-soil.jpg"><br>Fig 3: Silt in wet condition<br><br>Silt is a non plastic or low plasticity material due to its fineness. <br>Due to its fineness, when wet it becomes a smooth mud that you can form easily into balls or other shapes in your hand and when silt soil is very wet, it blends seamlessly with water to form fine, runny puddles of mud.<br><h3><strong>3. Clay </strong></h3>Clay particles are the finest of all the soil particles, measuring fewer than 0.002 mm in size. <br>It consists of microscopic and sub-microscopic particles derived from the chemical decomposition of rocks. <br>Clay is a fine grained cohesive soil. <br>They stick together readily and form a sticky or gluey texture when they are wet or dry.<br><br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Clay-696x464.jpg"><br>Fig 4: Clay when mixed with water<br><br>Clay is made of over 25 percent clay, and because of the spaces found between clay particles, clay soils hold a high amount of water. <br>Clay expand when in contact with water and shrink when getting dry. <br>Compared to sand particles, which are generally round, clay particles are thin, flat and covered with tiny plates. <br>Organic clay is highly compressible and its strength is very high when dry, which is why it is used in construction as mud mortar.<br><h3><strong>4. Loam </strong></h3>Loam is a mixture of clay, sand and silt and benefits from the qualities of these 3 different textures, favouring water retention, air circulation, drainage and fertility. <br>These soils are fertile, easy to work with and provide good drainage. <br>Depending on their predominant composition they can be either sandy or clay loam.<br><img src="https://theconstructor.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/loam.jpg"><br>Fig 5: Loam<br><br>The way the other particles combine in the soil makes the loam. <br>For instance, a soil that is 30 percent clay, 50 percent sand and 20 percent silt is a sandy clay loam, with the soil types before &#8220;loam&#8221; listed in the order their particles are most dominant in the loam. <br>The labels “clay loam,” “silt loam” and “sand loam” are used to refer to soils that are composed predominantly of those ingredients.<br>',

high <a href="https://phys.org/tags/power+density/">power density</a>—that is, the ratio between the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/power/">power</a> of the generated current and the volume of the battery. <br>However, chemical cells discharge in a relatively short time, limiting their applications in autonomous devices. <br>Some of these batteries, called accumulators, are rechargeable, but even they need to be replaced for charging. <br>This may be dangerous, as in the case of a cardiac pacemaker, or even impossible, if the battery is powering a spacecraft.<br><br>Fortunately, chemical reactions are just one of the possible sources of electric power. <br>In 1913, Henry Moseley invented the first power generator based on radioactive decay. <br>His <a href="https://phys.org/tags/nuclear+battery/">nuclear battery</a> consisted of a glass sphere silvered on the inside with a radium emitter mounted at the center on an isolated electrode. <br>Electrons resulting from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/beta+decay/">beta decay</a> of radium caused a potential difference between the silver film and the central electrode. <br>However, the idle voltage of the device was way too high—tens of kilovolts—and the current was too low for practical applications.<br><br>In 1953, Paul Rappaport proposed the use of semiconducting materials to convert the energy of beta decay into electricity. <br>Beta particles—electrons and positrons—emitted by a radioactive source ionize atoms of a semiconductor, creating uncompensated charge carriers. <br>In the presence of a static field of a p-n structure, the charges flow in one direction, resulting in an electric current. <br>Batteries powered by beta decay came to be known as betavoltaics. <br>The chief advantage of betavoltaic cells over galvanic cells is their longevity. <br>Radioactive isotopes used in nuclear batteries have half-lives ranging from tens to hundreds of years, so their <a href="https://phys.org/tags/power+output/">power output</a> remains nearly constant for a very long time. <br>Unfortunately, the power density of betavoltaic cells is significantly lower than that of their galvanic counterparts. <br>Despite this, betavoltaics were used in the 1970s to power cardiac pacemakers, before being phased out by cheaper lithium-ion batteries, even though the latter have shorter lifetimes.<br><br>Betavoltaic power sources should not be confused with radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or RTGs, which are also called nuclear batteries, but operate on a different principle. <br>Thermoelectric cells convert the heat released by radioactive decay into electricity using thermocouples. <br>The efficiency of RTGs is only several percent and depends on temperature. <br>But owing to their longevity and relatively simple design, thermoelectric power sources are widely used to power spacecraft such as the New Horizons probe and Mars rover Curiosity. <br>RTGs were previously used on unmanned remote facilities such as lighthouses and automatic weather stations. <br>However, this practice was abandoned, because used radioactive fuel was hard to recycle and leaked into the environment.<br><br>A research team led by Vladimir Blank, the director of TISNCM and chair of nanostructure physics and chemistry at MIPT, came up with a way of increasing the power density of a nuclear battery almost tenfold. <br>The physicists developed and manufactured a betavoltaic battery using nickel-63 as the source of radiation and Schottky barrier-based diamond diodes for energy conversion. <br>The prototype battery achieved an output power of about 1 microwatt, while the power density per cubic centimeter was 10 microwatts, which is enough for a modern artificial pacemaker. <br>Nickel-63 has a half-life of 100 years, so the battery packs about 3,300 milliwatt-hours of power per 1 gram—10 times more than electrochemical cells.<br><br><img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2018/1-prototypenuc.jpg"><br>A Nuclear battery design<br><br>The nuclear battery prototype consisted of 200 diamond converters interlaid with nickel-63 and stable nickel foil layers (figure 1). <br>The amount of power generated by the converter depends on the thickness of the nickel foil and the converter itself, because both affect how many beta particles are absorbed. <br>Currently available prototypes of nuclear batteries are poorly optimized, since they have excessive volume. <br>If the beta radiation source is too thick, the electrons it emits cannot escape it. <br>This effect is known as self-absorption. <br>However, as the source is made thinner, the number of atoms undergoing beta decay per unit time is proportionally reduced. <br>Similar reasoning applies to the thickness of the converter.<br><br>The goal of the researchers was to maximize the power density of their nickel-63 battery. <br>To do this, they numerically simulated the passage of electrons through the beta source and the converters. <br>It turned out that the nickel-63 source is at its most effective when it is 2 micrometers thick, and the optimal thickness of the converter based on Schottky barrier diamond diodes is around 10 micrometers.<br><br><b>Manufacturing technology</b><br><br>The main technological challenge was the fabrication of a large number of diamond conversion cells with complex internal structure. <br>Each converter was merely tens of micrometers thick, like a plastic bag in a supermarket. <br>Conventional mechanical and ionic techniques of diamond thinning were not suitable for this task. <br>The researchers from TISNCM and MIPT developed a unique technology for synthesizing thin diamond plates on a diamond substrate and splitting them off to mass-produce ultrathin converters.<br><br>The team used 20 thick boron-doped diamond crystal plates as the substrate. <br>They were grown using the temperature gradient technique under high pressure. <br>Ion implantation was used to create a 100-nanometer-thick defective, "damaged" layer in the substrate at the depth of about 700 nanometers. <br>A boron-doped diamond film 15 micrometers thick was grown on top of this layer using chemical vapor deposition. <br>The substrate then underwent high-temperature annealing to induce graphitization of the buried defective layer and recover the top diamond layer. <br>Electrochemical etching was used to remove the damaged layer. <br>Following the separation of the defective layer by etching, the semi-finished converter was fitted with ohmic and Schottky contacts.<br><br>As the operations were repeated, the loss of substrate thickness amounted to no more than 1 micrometer per cycle. <br>A total of 200 converters were grown on 20 substrates. <br>This new technology is important from an economic standpoint, because high-quality diamond substrates are very expensive and therefore mass-production of converters by substrate thinning is not feasible.<br><br>All converters were connected in parallel in a stack as shown in figure 1. <br>The technology for rolling 2-micrometer-thick nickel foil was developed at the Research Institute and Scientific Industrial Association LUCH. <br>The battery was sealed with epoxy.<br><br>The prototype battery is characterized by the current-voltage curve shown in figure 3a. <br>The open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current are 1.02 volts and 1.27 microamperes, respectively. <br>The maximum output power of 0.93 microwatts is obtained at 0.92 volts. <br>This power output corresponds to a specific power of about 3,300 milliwatt-hours per gramm, which is 10 times more than in commercial chemical cells or the previous nickel-63 nuclear battery designed at TISNCM.<br><br><br><img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2018/2-prototypenuc.jpg"><br>Photo of a prototype nuclear battery<br><br>In 2016, Russian researchers from MISIS had already presented a prototype betavoltaic battery based on nickel-63. <br>Another working prototype, created at TISNCM and LUCH, was demonstrated at Atomexpo 2017. <br>It had a useful volume of 1.5 cubic centimeters.<br><br>The main setback in commercializing nuclear batteries in Russia is the lack of nickel-63 production and enrichment facilities. <br>However, there are plans to launch nickel-63 production on an industrial scale by mid-2020s.<br><br>There is an alternative radioisotope for use in nuclear batteries: Dimond converters could be made using radioactive carbon-14, which has an extremely long half-life of 5,700 years. <br>Work on such generators was earlier reported by physicists from the University of Bristol.<br><br><b>Nuclear batteries: Prospects</b><br>The work reported in this story has prospects for medical applications. <br>Most state-of-the-art cardiac pacemakers are over 10 cubic centimeters in size and require about 10 microwatts of power. <br>This means that the new nuclear battery could be used to power these devices without any significant changes to their design and size. <br>"Perpetual pacemakers" whose batteries need not be replaced or serviced would improve the quality of life of patients.<br><br>The space industry would also greatly benefit from compact nuclear batteries. <br>In particular, there is a demand for autonomous wireless external sensors and memory chips with integrated power supply systems for spacecraft. <br>Diamond is one of the most radiation-proof semiconductors. <br>Since it also has a large bandgap, it can operate in a wide range of temperatures, making it the ideal material for nuclear batteries powering spacecraft.<br><br>The researchers are planning to continue their work on nuclear batteries. <br>They have identified several lines of inquiry that should be pursued. <br>Firstly, enriching nickel-63 in the radiation source would proportionally increase battery power. <br>Secondly, developing a diamond p-i-n structure with a controlled doping profile would boost voltage and therefore could increase the power output of the battery at least by a factor of three. <br>Thirdly, enhancing the surface area of the converter would increase the number of nickel-63 atoms on each converter.<br><br>TISNCM Director Vladimir Blank, who is also chair of nanostructure physics and chemistry at MIPT, commented on the study: "The results so far are already quite remarkable and can be applied in medicine and space technology, but we are planning to do more. <br>In the recent years, our institute has been rather successful in the synthesis of high-quality doped diamonds, particularly those with n-type conductivity. <br>This will allow us to make the transition from Schottky barriers to p-i-n structures and thus achieve three times greater battery power. <br>The higher the power density of the device, the more applications it will have. <br>We have decent capabilities for high-quality diamond synthesis, so we are planning to utilize the unique properties of this material for creating new radiation-proof electronic components and designing novel electronic and optical devices."<br><br><h3 id="nbtopic-2">atomic battery</h3><br>An <b>atomic battery</b>, <b>nuclear battery</b>, <b>tritium battery</b> or <b>radioisotope generator</b> is a device which uses energy from the decay of a radioactive isotope to generate electricity.<br><br>Like nuclear reactors, they generate electricity from nuclear energy, but differ in that they do not use a chain reaction.<br><br>Compared to other batteries, they are very costly, but have an extremely long life and high energy density, and so they are mainly used as power sources for equipment that must operate unattended for long periods of time, such as spacecraft, pacemakers, underwater systems and automated scientific stations in remote parts of the world.<br><br>Nuclear battery technology began in 1913, when Henry Moseley first demonstrated the beta cell. <br>The field received considerable in-depth research attention for applications requiring long-life power sources for space needs during the 1950s and 1960s. <br>In 1954 RCA researched a small atomic battery for small radio receivers and hearing aids. <br>Since RCA\'s initial research and development in the early 1950s, many types and methods have been designed to extract electrical energy from nuclear sources. <br>The scientific principles are well known, but modern nano-scale technology and new wide-bandgap semiconductors have created new devices and interesting material properties not previously available.<br><br>Batteries using the energy of radioisotope decay to provide long-lived power (10–20 years) are being developed internationally. <br>Conversion techniques can be grouped into two types: thermal and non-thermal. <br>The thermal converters (whose output power is a function of a temperature differential) include thermoelectric and thermionic generators. <br>The non-thermal converters (whose output power is not a function of a temperature difference) extract a fraction of the incident energy as it is being degraded into heat rather than using thermal energy to run electrons in a cycle. <br>Atomic batteries usually have an efficiency of 0.1–5%. <br>High-efficiency betavoltaics have 6–8%.<br><br><h3 id="nbtopic-3">Thermal converters</h3><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-4">Thermionic converter</b><br>A thermionic converter consists of a hot electrode, which thermionically emits electrons over a space-charge barrier to a cooler electrode, producing a useful power output. <br>Caesium vapor is used to optimize the electrode work functions and provide an ion supply (by surface ionization) to neutralize the electron space

Atomic Energy Commission, is planned to stimulate the pulsing action of a malfunctioning heart. <br>Circa 1967.<br>A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) uses thermocouples. <br>Each thermocouple is formed from two wires of different metals (or other materials).<br><br>A temperature gradient along the length of each wire produces a voltage gradient from one end of the wire to the other; but the different materials produce different voltages per degree of temperature difference.<br><br>By connecting the wires at one end, heating that end but cooling the other end, a usable, but small (millivolts), voltage is generated between the unconnected wire ends.<br><br>In practice, many are connected in series (or in parallel) to generate a larger voltage (or current) from the same heat source, as heat flows from the hot ends to the cold ends. <br>Metal thermocouples have low thermal-to-electrical efficiency. <br>However, the carrier density and charge can be adjusted in semiconductor materials such as bismuth telluride and silicon germanium to achieve much higher conversion efficiencies.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-6">Thermophotovoltaic cells</b><br>Thermophotovoltaic cells work by the same principles as a photovoltaic cell, except that they convert infrared light (rather than visible light) emitted by a hot surface, into electricity. <br>Thermophotovoltaic cells have an efficiency slightly higher than thermoelectric couples and can be overlaid on thermoelectric couples, potentially doubling efficiency. <br>The University of Houston TPV Radioisotope Power Conversion Technology development effort is aiming at combining thermophotovoltaic cells concurrently with thermocouples to provide a 3- to 4-fold improvement in system efficiency over current thermoelectric radioisotope generators.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-7">Stirling radioisotope generator</b><br>A Stirling radioisotope generator is a Stirling engine driven by the temperature difference produced by a radioisotope. <br>A more efficient version, the advanced Stirling radioisotope generator, was under development by NASA, but was cancelled in 2013 due to large-scale cost overruns.<br><br><h3 id="nbtopic-8">Non-thermal converters</h3><br>Non-thermal converters extract a fraction of the nuclear energy as it is being degraded into heat. <br>Their outputs are not functions of temperature differences as are thermoelectric and thermionic converters. <br>Non-thermal generators can be grouped into three classes.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-9">Direct-charging generators</b><br>In the first type, the primary generator consists of a capacitor charged by the current of charged particles from a radioactive layer deposited on one of the electrodes. <br>Spacing can be either vacuum or dielectric. <br>Negatively charged beta particles or positively charged alpha particles, positrons or fission fragments may be utilized. <br>Although this form of nuclear-electric generator dates back to 1913, few applications have been found in the past for the extremely low currents and inconveniently high voltages provided by direct-charging generators. <br>Oscillator/transformer systems are employed to reduce the voltages, then rectifiers are used to transform the AC power back to direct current.<br><br>English physicist H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;J. <br>Moseley constructed the first of these. <br>Moseley’s apparatus consisted of a glass globe silvered on the inside with a radium emitter mounted on the tip of a wire at the center. <br>The charged particles from the radium created a flow of electricity as they moved quickly from the radium to the inside surface of the sphere. <br>As late as 1945 the Moseley model guided other efforts to build experimental batteries generating electricity from the emissions of radioactive elements.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-10">Betavoltaics</b><br>Main article: Betavoltaics<br>Betavoltaics are generators of electric current, in effect a form of battery, which use energy from a radioactive source emitting beta particles (electrons). <br>A common source used is the hydrogen isotope, tritium. <br>Unlike most nuclear power sources, which use nuclear radiation to generate heat, which then generates electricity (thermoelectric and thermionic sources), betavoltaics use a non-thermal conversion process, using a semiconductor p-n junction.<br><br>Betavoltaics are particularly well-suited to low-power electrical applications where long life of the energy source is needed, such as implantable medical devices or military and space applications.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-11">Alphavoltaics</b><br>Alphavoltaic power sources are devices that use a semiconductor junction to produce electrical particle from energetic alpha particles.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-12">Optoelectric</b><br>Main article: Optoelectric nuclear battery<br>An optolectric nuclear battery has also been proposed by researchers of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow.<br><br>A beta-emitter (such as technetium-99) would stimulate an excimer mixture, and the light would power a photocell.<br><br>The battery would consist of an excimer mixture of argon/xenon in a pressure vessel with an internal mirrored surface, finely divided Tc-99, and an intermittent ultrasonic stirrer, illuminating a photocell with a bandgap tuned for the excimer.<br><br>The advantage of this design is that precision electrode assemblies are not needed, and most beta particles escape the finely divided bulk material to contribute to the battery\'s net power.<br><br><b class="topic" id="nbtopic-13">Reciprocating electromechanical atomic batteries</b><br>Main article: Radioisotope piezoelectric generator<br>Electromechanical atomic batteries use the buildup of charge between two plates to pull one bendable plate towards the other, until the two plates touch, discharge, equalizing the electrostatic buildup, and spring back. <br>The mechanical motion produced can be used to produce electricity through flexing of a piezoelectric material or through a linear generator. <br>Milliwatts of power are produced in pulses depending on the charge rate, in some cases multiple times per second (35&nbsp;Hz).<br><br><h3 id="nbtopic-14">Radioisotopes used</h3><br>Atomic batteries use radioisotopes that produce low energy beta particles or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. <br>Low energy beta particles are needed to prevent the production of high energy penetrating Bremsstrahlung radiation that would require heavy shielding. <br>Radioisotopes such as tritium, nickel-63, promethium-147, and technetium-99 have been tested. <br>Plutonium-238, curium-242, curium-244 and strontium-90 have been used.<br><br><h3 id="nbtopic-15">Micro-batteries</h3><br>Nuclear engineers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison have explored the possibilities of producing minuscule batteries which exploit radioactive nuclei of substances such as polonium or curium to produce electric energy. <br>As an example of an integrated, self-powered application, the researchers have created an oscillating cantilever beam that is capable of consistent, periodic oscillations over very long time periods without the need for refueling. <br>Ongoing work demonstrate that this cantilever is capable of radio frequency transmission, allowing MEMS devices to communicate with one another wirelessly.<br><br>These micro-batteries are very light and deliver enough energy to function as power supply for use in MEMS devices and further for supply for nanodevices.<br><br>The radiation energy released is transformed into electric energy,
