<p><strong>Step 1: Idea Brainstorming</strong>
</p>

<p>Before a new mug or mouse pad is born the first step is always to come up with a whole bunch of ideas and slogans for the design.<br>

<br>

This is basically a big brainstorming session and weeks of writing down random ideas on our phones.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

Then we put them all into one giant Google spreadsheet to decide which design ideas and slogans are worth moving forward to the design draft stage.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Design Drafts</strong>
</p>


<p>Once we've got an idea for a design&nbsp;we want to explore further, Anja sits down for a long time and comes up with several hand-lettered drafts for the design.<br>

<br>

This process can take a long time. Sometimes we'll quickly settle on a design after just a few iterations.<br>

<br>

And sometimes it takes days of experimentation to come up with an idea for a design that feels just right. This is mostly Anja's domain (and I think it's incredible watching her work).<br>

<br>

</p>

<strong>Step 3: Vectorizing The Design</strong>
<br>

<br>

After we've got a handlettered "master draft" for the design the next step is to digitize what up until now was basically a painting or a pencil drawing.<br>

<br>

We've experimented with different methods, like taking photos with various cameras.<br>

<br>

But in the end we settled on using a Canon scanner to get a high-DPI scan of the paper-based design.<br>

<br>

Anja then imports the scan into Adobe Illustrator to turn the bitmap image into a vector format suitable for printing on our products.<br>

<br>

You'd think that these days "vectorizing" a bitmap image would be a solved problem but it is actually crazy how much manual work is still required to get a result that feels right.<br>

<br>

So this stage can take a long time to get right (And let me tell you, Anja is a huge perfectionist and super detail-oriented.)<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<strong>Step 4: Adding Color</strong>
<br>

<br>

The next step is to take the vectorized design and to colorize it in order to get it ready for printing.<br>

<br>

Again we usually try out several color schemes before we settle on one or two that we like.<br>

<br>

Then it's time to export these files so we can send them of to our printer.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<strong>Step 5: Getting Test Prints Done</strong>
<br>

<br>

When we're happy with the digitized design master files we send them off to our printing partner to get a test print done.<br>

<br>

The facility we work with uses Kornit DTG printers that give a highly detailed and durable (also, dish washer safe) result.<br>

<br>

Getting the test prints made and mailed over to us takes another week or so.<br>

<br>

<strong>Step 6: Selling It</strong>
<br>

Finally, after potentially weeks of work and back and forth with different designs it's time to put our new creation up for sale
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<script>
  $(function() {
    var toc = $('#toc');

    function makeLi(text, href) {
      return $('<a href="' + href + '" target="_self">' + text + '</a><br>');
    }

    $('strong').each(function(i) {
      var chapter = $(this), chapterNumber = i + 1;
      toc.append(
        makeLi(chapter.text(), '#chapter-' + chapterNumber)
      );
      chapter.attr('id', 'chapter-' + chapterNumber);
    });

  });
</script>
</body>
</html>
