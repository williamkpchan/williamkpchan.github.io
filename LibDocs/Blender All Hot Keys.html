<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Object_Mode_HotKeys"> Object Mode HotKeys </span></h2>
<p>These hotkeys are mainly bound to the 3D Viewport Window, but many work on Objects in most other windows, like IPOs and so on, hence they are summarized here.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>HOME</b>. All Objects in the visible layer are displayed completely, centered in the window.
</dd><dd> <b>PAGEUP</b>. Select the next Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-PAGEUP</b>. Adds to selection the next Object Key.
</dd><dd> <b>PAGEDOWN.</b> Select the previous Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-PAGEDOWN.</b> Adds to selection the previous Object Key.
</dd><dd> <b>ACCENT.</b> (To the left of the <b>1KEY</b> in US keyboard) Select all layers.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-ACCENT.</b> Revert to the previous layer setting.
</dd><dd> <b>TAB.</b> Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: <b>ALT-E.</b>
</dd><dd> <b>AKEY.</b> Selects/deselects all.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-A.</b> Apply size and rotation. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are assigned to the ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.). At first glance, it appears as if nothing has changed, but this can have considerable consequences for animations or texture mapping. This is best illustrated by also having the axis of a Mesh Object be drawn (EditButtons-&gt;Axis). Rotate the Object and activate Apply. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are 'erased'.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-CTRL-A.</b> If the active Object is automatically duplicated (see AnimButtons-&gt;DupliFrames or AnimButtons- &gt;Dupliverts), a menu asks Make duplis real?. This option actually creates the Objects. If the active Mesh Object is deformed by a Lattice, a menu asks Apply Lattice deform?. Now the deformation of the Lattice is assigned to the vertices of the Mesh.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-A.</b> This is the AddMenu. In fact, it is the ToolBox that starts with the `ADD' option. When Objects are added, Blender starts EditMode immediately if possible.
</dd><dd> <b>BKEY.</b> Border Select. Draw a rectangle with the LeftMouse; all Objects within this area are selected, but not made active. Draw a rectangle with the RightMouse to deselect Objects. In orthonormal ViewMode, the dimensions of the rectangle are displayed, expressed as global coordinates, as an extra feature in the lower left corner. In Camera ViewMode, the dimensions that are to be rendered according to the DisplayButtons are displayed in pixel units.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-B.</b> Render Border. This only works in Camera ViewMode. Draw a rectangle to render a smaller cut-out of the standard window frame. If the option DisplayButtons-&gt;Border is ON, a box is drawn with red and black lines.
</dd><dd> <b>CKEY</b>. Centre View. The position of the 3DCursor becomes the new centre of the 3DWindow.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>ALT-C.</b> Convert Menu. Depending on the active Object, a PopupMenu is displayed. This enables you to convert certain types of ObData. It only converts in one direction, everything ultimately degrades to a Mesh! The options are:
<ul><li> Font -&gt; Curve
</li><li> MetaBall -&gt; Mesh The original MetaBall remains unchanged.
</li><li> Curve -&gt; Mesh
</li><li> Surface -&gt; Mesh
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><ul><li><b>CTRL-C.</b> Copy Menu. This menu copies information from the active Object to (other) selected Objects.
<ul><li> <i>Fixed components are:</i>
<ul><li> Copy Loc: the X,Y,Z location of the Object. If a Child is involved, this location is the relative position in relation to the Parent.
</li><li> Copy Rot: the X,Y,Z rotation of the Object.
</li><li> Copy Size: the X,Y,Z dimension of the Object.
</li><li> DrawType: copies Object Drawtype.
</li><li> TimeOffs: copies Object time offset.
</li><li> Dupli: all Duplicator data (Dupliframes, Dupliverts and so on)
</li><li> Mass: Real time stuff.
</li><li> Damping: Real time stuff.
</li><li> Properties: Real time stuff.
</li><li> Logic Bricks: Real time stuff.
</li><li> Constraints: copies Object constraints.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <i>If applicable:</i>
<ul><li> Copy TexSpace: The texture space.
</li><li> Copy Particle Settings: the complete particle system from the AnimButtons.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <i>For Curve Objects:</i>
<ul><li> Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <i>Font Objects:</i>
<ul><li> Copy Font Settings: font type, dimensions, spacing.
</li><li> Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <i>Camera Objects:</i>
<ul><li> Copy Lens: the lens value.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>SHIFT-C.</b> CentreZero View. The 3DCursor is set to zero (0,0,0) and the view is changed so that all Objects, including the 3Dcursor, can be displayed. This is an alternative for <b>HOME.</b>
</dd><dd> <b>DKEY.</b> Draw mode menu. Allows to select draw modes exactly as the corresponding menu in the 3D viewport header does.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-D.</b> Add Duplicate. The selected Objects are duplicated. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-D.</b> Add Linked Duplicate. Of the selected Objects linked duplicates are created. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-D.</b> Draw the (texture) Image as wire. This option has a limited function. It can only be used for 2D compositing.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-E.</b> Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: <b>TAB.</b>
</dd><dd> <b>FKEY.</b> If selected Object is a mesh Toggles Face selectMode on and off.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-F.</b> Sort Faces. The faces of the active Mesh Object are sorted, based on the current view in the 3DWindow. The leftmost face first, the rightmost last. The sequence of faces is important for the Build Effect (AnimButtons).
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>GKEY</b>. Grab Mode. Or: the translation mode. This works on selected Objects and vertices. Blender calculates the quantity and direction of the translation, so that they correspond exactly with the mouse movements, regardless of the ViewMode or view direction of the 3DWindow. Alternatives for starting this mode:
<ul><li> <b>LMB</b> to draw a straight line.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The following options are available in translation mode:
<ul><li> <i>Limiters:</i>
<ul><li> <b>CTRL:</b> in increments of 1 grid unit.
</li><li> <b>SHIFT:</b> fine movements.
</li><li> <b>SHIFT-CTRL:</b> in increments of 0.1 grid unit.
</li><li> <b>SHIFT-X:</b> Locking the X axis in place. Moving along Y, Z axis only. <font color="red">*</font>
</li><li> <b>SHIFT-Y:</b> Locking the Y axis in place. Moving along X, Z axis only. <font color="red">*</font>
</li><li> <b>SHIFT-Z:</b> Locking the Z axis in place. Moving along X, Y axis only. <font color="red">*</font>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b>MMB</b> toggles: A short click restricts the current translation to the X,Y or Z axis. Blender calculates which axis to use, depending on the already initiated mouse movement. Click MiddleMouse again to return to unlimited translation.
</li><li> <b>XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY</b> constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
</li><li> a second <b>XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY</b> constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
</li><li> a third <b>XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY</b> removes constraints.
</li><li> <b>NKEY</b> enters numerical input, as well as any numeric
</li><li> key directly. <b>TAB</b> will switch between values, <b>ENTER </b>finalizes, <b>ESC</b> exits.
</li><li> <b>ARROWS:</b> These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
</li><li> <i>Grabber can be terminated with:</i>
<ul><li> <b>LMB SPACE</b> or <b>ENTER:</b> move to a new position.
</li><li> <b>RMB</b> or <b>ESC:</b> everything goes back to the old position.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <i>Switching mode:</i>
<ul><li> <b>GKEY:</b> starts Grab mode again.
</li><li> <b>SKEY:</b> switches to Size (Scale) mode.
</li><li> <b>RKEY:</b> switches to Rotate mode.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>ALT-G.</b> Clears translations, given in Grab mode. The X,Y,Z locations of selected Objects are set to zero.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-ALT-G.</b> Translation Manipulator. <font color="red">*</font>
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>SHIFT-G.</b> Group Selection
<ul><li> <i>Children:</i> Selects all selected Object's Children.
</li><li> <i>Immediate Children:</i> Selects all selected Object's first level Children.
</li><li> <i>Parent:</i> Selects selected Object's Parent.
</li><li> <i>Shared Layers:</i> Selects all Object on the same Layer of active Object
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>IKEY.</b> Insert Object Key. A keyposition is inserted in the current frame of all selected Objects. A PopupMenu asks what key position(s) must be added to the IpoCurves.
<ul><li> <i>Loc:</i> The XYZ location of the Object.
</li><li> <i>Rot:</i> The XYZ rotation of the Object.
</li><li> <i>Size:</i> The XYZ dimensions of the Object
</li><li> <i>LocRot:</i> The XYZ location and XYZ rotation of the Object.
</li><li> <i>LocRotSize:</i> The XYZ location, XYZ rotation and XYZ dimensions of the Object.
</li><li> <i>Layer:</i> The layer of the Object.
</li><li> <i>Avail:</i> A position is only added to all the current IpoCurves, that is curves which already exists.
</li><li> Mesh, Lattice, Curve or Surface: depending on the type of Object, a VertexKey can be added
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>CTRL-J.</b> Join Objects. All selected Objects of the same type are added to the active Object. What actually happens here is that the ObData blocks are combined and all the selected Objects (except for the active one) are deleted. This is a rather complex operation, which can lead to confusing results, particularly when working with a lot of linked data, animation curves and hierarchies.
</dd><dd> <b>KKEY.</b> Show Keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects. If all of them were already ON, they are all turned OFF.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-K.</b> A PopupMenu asks: OK? Show and select all keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects, and all Object-keys are selected. This function is used to enable transformation of the entire animation system.
</dd><dd> <b>LKEY.</b> Makes selected Object local. Makes library linked objects local for the current scene.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>CTRL-L.</b> Link selected. Links some of the Active Object data to all selected Objects, the following menu entry appears only if applicable.
<ul><li> <i>To Scene:</i> Creates a link of the Object to a scene.
</li><li> <i>Object IPOs:</i> Links Active Object IPOs to selected ones.
</li><li> <i>Mesh data:</i> Links Active Object Mesh data selected ones.
</li><li> <i>Lamp Data:</i> Links Active Object Lamp data to selected ones.
</li><li> <i>Surf Data:</i> Links Active Object Surf data selected ones.
</li><li> <i>Material:</i> Links Active Object Material to selected ones.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>SHIFT-L.</b> Select Linked. Selects all Objects somehow linked to active Object.
<ul><li> <i>Object IPO:</i> Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's IPOs.
</li><li> <i>Object Data:</i> Selects all Object(s) sharing active  Object's ObData.
</li><li> <i>Current Material:</i> Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's current Material.
</li><li> <i>Current Texture:</i> Selects all Object(s) sharing  active Object's current Texture.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>MKEY.</b> Moves selected Object(s) to another layer, a pop-up appers. Use <b>LMB</b> to move, use <b>SHIFT-LMB</b> to make the object belong to multiple layers. If the selected Objects have different layers, this is ORed in the menu display. Use ESC to exit the menu. Press the "OK" button or <b>ENTER</b> to change the layer seting. The hotkeys (<b>ALT</b>-)(<b>1KEY, 2KEY</b>, ... - <b>0KEY</b>) work here as well (see 3DHeader).
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-M.</b> Mirror Menu. It is possible to mirror an Object along the X, Y or Z axis.
</dd><dd> <b>NKEY.</b> Number Panel. The location, rotation and scaling of the active Object are displayed and can be modified.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-O.</b> Clear Origin. The `Origin' is erased for all Child Objects, which causes the Child Objects to move to the exact location of the Parent Objects.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-O.</b> If the selected Object is a Mesh toggles SubSurf onn/ off. <b>CTRL-1</b> to <b>CTRL-4</b> switches to the relative SubSurf level for display purpouses. Rendering SUbSurf level has no HotKey.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>CTRL-P.</b> Make selected Object(s) the child(ren) of the active Object. If the Parent is a Curve then a popup offers two choices:
<ul><li> <i>Normal Parent:</i> Make a normal parent, the curve can be made a path later on.
</li><li> <i>Follow Path:</i> Automatically creates a Follow Path constraint with the curve as target. If the Parent is an Armature, a popup offers three options:
</li><li> <i>Use Bone:</i> One of the Bones becomes the parent. The Object will not be deformed. A popup permits to select the bone. This is the option if you are modeling a robot or machinery
</li><li> <i>Use Armature:</i> The whole armature is used as parent for deformations. This is the choiche for organic beings.
</li><li> <i>Use Object:</i> Standard parenting. In the second case further options asks if Vertex groups
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>should not be created, should be created empty or created and populated.
</p>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>ALT-P.</b> Clears Parent relation, user is asked if he wishes to keep or clear parent-induced transforms.
<ul><li> <i>Clear Parent:</i> the selected Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent. since the transformation of the Parent disappears, this can appear as if the former Children themselves are transformed.
</li><li> <i>... and keep transform:</i> the Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent, and an attempt is made to assign the current transformation, which was determined in part by the Parent, to the (former Child) Objects.
</li><li> <i>Clear Parent inverse:</i> The inverse matrix of the Parent of the selected Objects is erased. The Child Objects remain linked to the Objects. This gives the user complete control over the hierarchy.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>SHIFT-P.</b> Push/Pull Transformations. It is a bit like scaling, except that every element is moved the same distance toward or away from the center. The distance they move is controlled by moving the mouse toward you (pull away from center) or away from you (push toward center). <font color="red">*</font>
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>RKEY.</b> Rotate mode. Works on selected Object(s). In Blender, a rotation is by default a rotation perpendicular to the screen, regardless of the view direction or ViewMode. The degree of rotation is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try moving around the rotation midpoint with the mouse. The rotation pivot point is determined by the state of the 3DWiewport Header buttons. Alternatives for starting this mode:
<ul><li> <b>LMB</b> to draw a C-shaped curve.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The following options are available in rotation mode:
<ul><li> <i>Limiters:</i>
<ul><li> <b>CTRL</b>: in increments of 5 degrees.
</li><li> <b>SHIFT</b>: fine movements.

</li><li> a second <b>XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY</b> constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
</li><li> a third <b>XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY</b> removes constraints.
</li><li> <b>NKEY</b> enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. <b>ENTER</b> finalizes, <b>ESC</b> exits.
</li><li> <b>ARROWS</b>: These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
</li><li> <i>Rotation can be terminated with:</i>
<ul><li> <b>LMB SPACE</b> or <b>ENTER</b>: move to a new position.
</li><li> <b>RMB</b> or <b>ESC</b>: everything goes back to the old position.

<dl><dd> <b>ALT-R.</b> Clears Rotation. The X,Y,Z rotations of selected Objects are set to zero.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-ALT-R.</b> Rotation Manipulator. <font color="red">*</font>
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> <b>SKEY.</b> Size mode or scaling mode. Works on selected Object(s). The degree of scaling is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try to move from the (rotation) midpoint with the mouse. The pivot point is determined by the settings of the 3D Viewport header pivot Menu. Alternatives for starting scaling mode:
<ul><li> <b>LMB</b> to draw a V-shaped line.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The following options are available in scaling mode:

<dl><dd> <b>TKEY.</b> Texture space mode. The position and dimensions of the texture space for the selected Objects can be changed in the same manner as described above for Grab and Size mode. To make this visible, the drawingflag EditButtons-&gt;TexSpace is set ON. A PopupMenu asks you to select: "Grabber" or "Size".
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-T.</b> Makes selected Object(s) track the Active Object. Old track method was Blender default tracking before version 2.30. The new method is the Constrain Track, this creates a fully editable constraint on the selected object targeting the active Object.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-T.</b> Clears old style Track. Constraint track is removed as all constrains are.
</dd><dd> <b>UKEY.</b> Makes Object Single User, the inverse operation of Link
</dd></dl>
<ul><li><ul><li> (<b>CTRL-L</b>) a pop-up appears with choices.
<ul><li> <i>Object:</i> if other Scenes also have a link to this Object, the link is deleted and the Object is copied. The Object now only exists in the current Scene. The links from the Object remain unchanged.
</li><li> <i>Object &amp; ObData:</i> Similar to the previous command, but now the ObData blocks with multiple links are copied as well. All selected Objects are now present in the current Scene only, and each has a unique ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.).
</li><li> <i>Object &amp; ObData &amp; Materials+Tex:</i> Similar to the previous command, but now Materials and Textures with multiple links are also copied. All selected Objects are now unique. They have unique ObData and each has a unique Material and Texture block. 
</li><li> <i>Materials+Tex:</i> Only the Materials and Textures with multiple links are copied.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>VKEY.</b> Switches in/out of Vertex Paint Mode.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-V.</b> Object-Image Aspect. This hotkey sets the X and Y dimensions of the selected Objects in relation to the dimensions of the Image Texture they have. Use this hotkey when making 2D Image compositions and multi-plane designs to quickly place the Objects in the appropriate relationship with one another.
</dd><dd> <b>WKEY.</b> Opens Object Booleans Menu.
</dd><dd> <b>XKEY.</b> Erase Selected? Deletes selected objects.
</dd><dd> <b>ZKEY.</b> Toggles Solid Mode on/off.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Edit_Mode_-_General"> Edit Mode - General</span></h2>
<p>Again, Most of these hotkeys are usefull in the 3D Viewport when in Edit Mode, but many work on other Blender Objects, so they are summarized here. Many Object Mode keys work in Edit mode too, but on the selected vertices or control points; among these Grab, Rotate, Scale and so on. These hotkeys are not repeated here.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>TAB</b> or <b>ALT-E.</b> This button starts and stops Edit Mode.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-TAB.</b> Switches between Vertex Select, Edge Select, and Face Select modes. Holding SHIFT while clicking on a mode will allow you to combine modes.
</dd><dd> <b>AKEY.</b> Select/Unselect all.
</dd><dd> <b>BKEY-BKEY</b>. Circle Select. If you press BKEY a second time after starting Border Select, Circle Select is invoked. It works as described above. Use NUM+ or NUM- or MW to adjust the circle size. Leave Circle Select with <b>RMB</b> or <b>ESC</b>.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-H.</b> With vertices selected, this creates a "Hook" object. Once a hook is selected, CTRL-H brings up an options menu for it.
</dd><dd> <b>NKEY.</b> Number Panel. Simpler than the Object Mode one, in Edit Mode works for Mesh, Curve, Surface: The location of the active vertex is displayed.
</dd><dd> <b>OKEY.</b> Switch in/out of Proportional Editing.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-O.</b> Toggles between Smooth and Sharp Proportional Editing.
</dd><dd> <b>PKEY.</b> SeParate. You can choose to make a new object with all selected vertices, edges, faces and curves or create a new object from each separate group of interconnected vertices from a popup. Note that for curves you cannot separate connected control vertices. This operation is the opposite of Join (<b>CTRL-J</b>).
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-P.</b> Make Vertex Parent. If one object (or more than one) is/are selected and the active Object is in Edit Mode with 1 or 3 vertices selected then the Object in Edit Mode becomes the Vertex Parent of the selected Object(s). If only 1 vertex is selected, only the location of this vertex determines the Parent transformation; the rotation and dimensions of the Parent do not play a role here. If three vertices are selected, it is a `normal' Parent relationship in which the 3 vertices determine the rotation and location of the Child together. This method produces interesting effects with Vertex Keys. In EditMode, other Objects can be selected with CTRL-RMB.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-S.</b> Shear. In EditMode this operation enables you to make selected forms `slant'. This always works via the horizontal screen axis.
</dd><dd> <b>UKEY.</b> Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and can be returned to via UKEY. Mesh Objects have better Undo, see next section.
</dd><dd> <b>WKEY.</b> Specials PopupMenu. A number of tools are included in this PopupMenu as an alternative to the Edit Buttons. This makes the buttons accessible as shortcuts, e.g. EditButtons-&gt; Subdivide is also `WKEY, 1KEY'.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-W.</b> Warp. Selected vertices can be bent into curves with this option. It can be used to convert a plane into a tube or even a sphere. The centre of the circle is the 3DCursor. The mid-line of the circle is determined by the horizontal dimensions of the selected vertices. When you start, everything is already bent 90 degrees. Moving the mouse up or down increases or decreases the extent to which warping is done. By zooming in/out of the 3Dwindow, you can specify the maximum degree of warping. The CTRL limiter increments warping in steps of 5 degrees.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="EditMode_-_Mesh"> EditMode - Mesh </span></h2>
<p>This section and the following highlight peculiar EditMode Hotkeys.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>CTRL-NUM+.</b> Adds to selection all vertices connected by an edge to an already selected vertex.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-NUM-.</b> Removes from selection all vertices of the outer ring of selected vertices.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-CTRL-RMB.</b> Edge select.
</dd><dd> <b>CKEY.</b> If using curve deformations, this toggles the curve Cyclic mode on/off.
</dd><dd> <b>EKEY.</b> Extrude Selected. "Extrude" in EditMode transforms all the selected edges to faces. If possible, the selected faces are also duplicated. Grab mode is started directly after this command is executed.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-EKEY.</b> Crease Subsurf edge. With "Draw Creases" enabled, pressing this key will allow you to set the crease weight. Black edges have no weight, edge-select color have full weight.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-EKEY.</b> Mark LSCM Seam. Marks a selected edge as a "seam" for unwrapping using the LSCM mode.
</dd><dd> <b>FKEY.</b> Make Edge/Face. If 2 vertices are selected, an edge is created. If 3 or 4  vertices are selected, a face is created.  If 2 or more faces are selected, an FGon can be created.  In 2.41 (and probably earlier), faces do not have to be co-planar to form an FGon.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-F.</b> Fill selected. All selected vertices that are bound by edges and form a closed polygon are filled with triangular faces. Holes are automatically taken into account. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-F.</b> Beauty Fill. The edges of all the selected triangular faces are switched in such a way that equally sized faces are formed. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession. The Beauty Fill can be performed immediately after a Fill.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-F.</b> Flip faces, selected triangular faces are paired and common edge of each pair swapped.
</dd><dd> <b>HKEY.</b> Hide Selected. All selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-H.</b> Hide Not Selected: All non-selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.

</li><li> <i>Knife (exact):</i> (<b>SHIFT-K</b>) Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges are cut at intersections with mouse line. <b>ENTER</b> or <b>RMB</b> finalizes, <b>ESC</b> exits.
</li><li> <i>Knife (midpoints):</i> (<b>SHIFT-K</b>) Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges intersecting with mouse line are cut in middle regardless of true intersection point. <b>ENTER</b> or <b>RMB</b> finalizes, <b>ESC</b> exits.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <b>LKEY.</b> Select Linked. If you start with an unselected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-L.</b> Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-L.</b> Select Linked Selected. Starting with all selected vertices, all vertices connected to them are selected too.
</dd><dd> <b>MKEY.</b> Mirror. Opens a popup asking for the axis to mirror. 3 possible axis group are available, each of which contains three axes, for a total of nine choices. Axes can be Global (Blender Global Reference); Local (Current Object Local Reference) or View (Current View reference). Remember that mirroring, like scaling, happens with respect to the current pivot point.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-M.</b> Merges selected vertices at barycentrum or at cursor depending on selection made on pop-up.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-N.</b> Calculate Normals Outside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `outward'.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-CTRL-N.</b> Calculate Normals Inside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `inward'.
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-S.</b> Whereas <b>SHIFT-S</b> scales in Edit Mode as it does in Object Mode, for Edit Mode a further option exists, <b>ALT-S</b> moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, hence effectively shrinking/fattening the mesh.
</dd><dd> <b>CTRL-T.</b> Make Triangles. All selected faces are converted to triangles.
</dd><dd> <b>UKEY.</b> Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and all subsequent changes are saved on a stack. This option enables you to restore the previous situation, one after the other.
</dd><dd> <b>SHIFT-U.</b> Redo. This let you re-apply any undone changes up to the moment in which Edit Mode was entered
</dd><dd> <b>ALT-U.</b> Undo Menu. This let you choose the exact point to which you want to undo changes.
