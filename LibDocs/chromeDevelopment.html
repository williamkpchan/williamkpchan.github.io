<h2><span class="orange">Overview</span></h2>
Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYyQv0CSZOE" title="youtube embed"></iframe>

Check out the video for live demonstrations of core DevTools workflows, including debugging CSS, prototyping CSS, debugging JavaScript, and analyzing load performance.
<h2>Open DevTools</h2>
There are many ways to open DevTools, because different users want quick access to different parts of the DevTools UI.

When you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select <strong>Inspect</strong> to jump into the <strong>Elements</strong> panel. Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).
When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to jump straight into the <strong>Console</strong> panel.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/">Open Chrome DevTools</a> for more details and workflows.

<h2>Select an element</h2>

The <strong>Elements</strong> panel of DevTools lets you view or change the CSS of one element at a time. The selected element is highlighted blue in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>. The element's styles are shown in the <strong>Styles</strong> pane. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css#view">View an element's CSS</a> for a tutorial.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Iganvpf9K9dEOpSb6wIA.png">
<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The <code>h1</code> element that's highlighted blue in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong> is the selected element. To the right, the element's styles are shown in the <strong>Styles</strong> pane. To the left, the element is highlighted in the viewport, but only because the mouse is currently hovering over it in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>

There are many ways to select an element:
In your viewport, right-click the element and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
In DevTools, click <strong>Select an element</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/7HgaRejtWu4NfpPOTtJU.png">
 or press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (Windows, Linux), and then click the element in the viewport.
In DevTools, click the element in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.

In DevTools, run a query like <code>document.querySelector('p')</code> in the <strong>Console</strong>, right-click the result, and then select <strong>Reveal in Elements panel</strong>.
<h2>View CSS</h2>
<h3>&emsp;View the external stylesheet where a rule is defined</h3>

In the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, click the link next to a CSS rule to open the external stylesheet that defines the rule.
If the stylesheet is minified, see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/reference#format">Make a minified file readable</a>.

Clicking <code>devsite-google-blue.css:487</code> takes you to line 487 of <code>devsite-google-blue.css</code>, where the <code>.devsite-article h1:first-of-type</code> CSS rule is defined.

<h3>&emsp;View only the CSS that's actually applied to an element</h3>
The <strong>Styles</strong> tab shows you all of the rules that apply to an element, including declarations that have been overridden. When you're not interested in overridden declarations, use the <strong>Computed</strong> tab to view only the CSS that's actually being applied to an element.
<a href="#select">Select an element</a>.

Go to the <strong>Computed</strong> tab in the <strong>Elements</strong> panel.
<strong>Note:</strong> On a wide DevTools window, the <strong>Computed</strong> tab does not exist. The contents of the <strong>Computed</strong> tab are shown on the <strong>Styles</strong> tab.
Inherited properties are opaque. Check the <strong>Show All</strong> checkbox to see all inherited values.

<h3>&emsp;Add a CSS declaration to an element</h3>

Since the order of declarations affects how an element is styled, you can add declarations in different ways:
<a href="#add-declaration-inline">Add a inline declaration</a>. Equivalent to adding a <code>style</code> attribute to the element's HTML.
<a href="#add-declaration-to-rule">Add a declaration to a style rule</a>.

<strong>What workflow should you use?</strong> For most scenarios, you probably want to use the inline declaration workflow. Inline declarations have higher specificity than external ones, so the inline workflow ensures that the changes take effect in the element as you'd expect. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#Selector_Types">Selector Types</a> for more on specificity.
If you're debugging an element's styles and you need to specifically test what happens when a declaration is defined in different places, use the other workflow.
<h4>

Add an inline declaration</h4>
To add an inline declaration:
<a href="#select">Select an element</a>.

In the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, click between the brackets of the <strong>element.style</strong> section. The cursor focuses, allowing you to enter text.
Enter a property name and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Enter a valid value for that property and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. In the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, you can see that a <code>style</code> attribute has been added to the element.

<strong>Figure 12</strong>. The <code>margin-top</code> and <code>background-color</code> properties have been applied to the selected element. In the <strong>DOM Tree</strong> you can see the declarations reflected in the element's <code>style</code> attribute
<h4>

Add a declaration to a style rule</h4>
To add a declaration to an existing style rule:
<a href="#select">Select an element</a>.

In the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, click between the brackets of the style rule to which you want to add the declaration. The cursor focuses, allowing you to enter text.
Enter a property name and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Enter a valid value for that property and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<h3>&emsp;Change a declaration name or value</h3>
Double-click a declaration's name or value to change it. See <a href="#values-shortcuts">Change declaration values with keyboard shortcuts</a> for shortcuts for quickly incrementing or decrementing a value by 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 units.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dQMFYTxsVz5WxQpuvRga.png">
<h3>&emsp;Change declaration values with keyboard shortcuts</h3>
While editing the value of a declaration, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to increment the value by a fixed amount:

<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> (Windows, Linux) to increment by 0.1.
<kbd>Up</kbd> to change the value by 1, or by 0.1 if the current value is between -1 and 1.
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> to increment by 10.

<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Page Up</kbd> (Windows, Linux) to increment the value by 100.
Decrementing also works. Just replace each instance of <kbd>Up</kbd> mentioned above with <kbd>Down</kbd>.
<h3>&emsp;Add a class to an element</h3>

To add a class to an element:
<a href="#select">Select the element</a> in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
Click <strong>.cls</strong>.

Enter the name of the class in the <strong>Add New Class</strong> text box.
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Inspect animations</span></h2>
Inspect and modify animations with the Chrome DevTools Animation Inspector.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/NbXydhQGmfbeMOPHCHu9.png">

<h2>Summary</h2>
Capture animations by opening the Animation Inspector. It automatically detects animations and sorts them into groups.
Inspect animations by slowing them down, replaying them, or viewing their source code.

Modify animations by changing their timing, delay, duration, or keyframe offsets.
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Chrome DevTools Animation Inspector has two main purposes.

Inspecting animations. You want to slow down, replay, or inspect the source code for an animation group.
Modifying animations. You want to modify the timing, delay, duration, or keyframe offsets of an animation group. Bezier editing and keyframe editing are currently not supported.
The Animation Inspector supports CSS animations, CSS transitions, and web animations. <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> animations are currently not supported.

<h3>&emsp;What's an animation group?</h3>
An animation group is a group of animations that <em>appear</em> to be related to each other. Currently, the web has no real concept of a group animation, so motion designers and developers have to compose and time individual animations so that they appear to be one coherent visual effect. The Animation Inspector predicts which animations are related based on start time (excluding delays, and so on) and groups them all side-by-side. In other words, a set of animations all triggered in the same script block are grouped together, but if they're asynchronous then they're grouped separately.
<h2>Get started</h2>

There are two ways to open the Animation Inspector:
Through the Main Menu:
Click <strong>More</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/MU5oyGVk9rFUORcbptoZ.png">
 to open the Main Menu.
Navigate to the <strong>More tools</strong> sub-menu.

Select <strong>Animations</strong>:<br>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/VVGz6geZHi4jFJuuUxoT.png">
Open the Command Menu and type <code>Show Animations</code>.

The Animation Inspector opens up as a tab next to the Console Drawer. Since it's a Drawer tab, you can use it from any DevTools panel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/6dTrFBnaasvcKhrQreDm.png">
The Animation Inspector is grouped into four main sections (or panes). This guide refers to each pane as follows:

<strong>Controls</strong>. From here you can clear all currently captured Animation Groups, or change the speed of the currently selected Animation Group.
<strong>Overview</strong>. Select an Animation Group here to inspect and modify it in the <strong>Details</strong> pane.
<strong>Timeline</strong>. Pause and start an animation from here, or jump to a specific point in the animation.

<strong>Details</strong>. Inspect and modify the currently selected Animation Group.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/PNT2B9LyO9ZK7O7YPpQV.png">
To capture an animation, just perform the interaction that triggers the animation while the Animation Inspector is open. If an animation is triggered on page load, you can help the Animation Inspector detect the animation by reloading the page.

<h2>Inspect animations</h2>
Once you've captured an animation, there are a few ways to replay it:
Hover over its thumbnail in the <strong>Overview</strong> pane to view a preview of it.

Select the Animation Group from the <strong>Overview</strong> pane (so that it's displayed in the <strong>Details</strong> pane) and press the <strong>replay</strong> button (
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/0TdVNMElxodMWBFqfRze.png">
 to change the preview speed of the currently selected Animation Group. You can use the red vertical bar to change your current position.

Click and drag the red vertical bar to scrub the viewport animation.
<h3>&emsp;View animation details</h3>
Once you've captured an Animation Group, click on it from the <strong>Overview</strong> pane to view its details. In the <strong>Details</strong> pane each individual animation gets its own row.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/vdjLKNjWK79GW3PgiJol.png">
Hover over an animation to highlight it in the viewport. Click on the animation to select it in the <strong>Elements</strong> panel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/cwfsRGVqdUx09qYmZGzu.png">

The leftmost, darker section of an animation is its definition. The right, more faded section represents iterations. For example, in the screenshot below, sections two and three represent iterations of section one.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/X3dRm6DBme4PfCjPAXZO.png">
If two elements have the same animation applied to them, the Animation Inspector assigns them the same color. The color itself is random and has no significance. For example, in the screenshot below the two elements <code>div.eye.left::after</code> and <code>div.eye.right::after</code> have the same animation (<code>eyes</code>) applied to them, as do the <code>div.feet::before</code> and <code>div.feet::after</code> elements.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/czOX5s4gDuLjnoFl7mmv.png">
<h2>Modify animations</h2>
There are three ways you can modify an animation with the Animation Inspector:

Animation duration.
Keyframe timings.
Start time delay.

For this section suppose that the screenshot below represents the original animation:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/XKgSjsvRLNrQkapxpekI.png">
To change the duration of an animation, click and drag the first or last circle.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ilDNkK4AfTzWeAbe9MZZ.png">
If the animation defines any keyframe rules, then these are represented as white inner circles. Click and drag one of these to change the timing of the keyframe.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/jJHtenLps4VT8RYWUDxS.png">

To add a delay to an animation, click and drag it anywhere except the circles.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Inspect CSS Grid</span></h2>
This guide shows you how to discover CSS grids on a page, examining them and debugging layout issues in the <strong>Elements</strong> panel of Chrome DevTools.
The examples shown in the screenshots appearing in this article are from these two web pages: <a href="https://jec.fyi/demo/css-grid-fruit">Fruit box</a> and <a href="https://jec.fyi/demo/css-grid-snack">Snack box</a>.

<h2>Discover CSS grids</h2>
When an HTML element on your page has <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: inline-grid</code> applied to it, you can see a <code>grid</code> badge next to it in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/"><strong>Elements</strong></a> panel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/SbWH3OGFQDiXKV2Eev2j.png">

Clicking the badge to toggle the display of a grid overlay on the page. The overlay appears over the element, laid out like a grid to show the position of its grid lines and tracks:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/YwKMuoODL6eFMvfJOzlF.png">
Open the <strong>Layout</strong> pane. When grids are included on a page, the Layout pane includes a <strong>Grid</strong> section containing a number of options for viewing those grids.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/r4Ignwcmy4VzFqs3Zzb1.png">
<h2>Grid viewing options</h2>
The <strong>Grid</strong> section in the <strong>Layout</strong> pane contains 2 sub sections:

Overlay display settings
Grid overlays
Let's look into each of these sub sections in detail.

<h2>Overlay display settings</h2>
The <strong>Overlay display settings</strong> consists of 2 parts:
a. A dropdown menu with options within:

<strong>Hide line labels</strong>: Hide the line labels for each grid overlay.
<strong>Show lines number</strong>: Show the line numbers for each grid overlay (selected by default).
<strong>Show line names</strong>: Show the line names for each grid overlay in the case of grids with line names.

b. Checkboxes with options within:
<strong>Show track sizes</strong>: Toggle to show or hide track sizes.
<strong>Show area names</strong>: Toggle to show or hide area names, in the case of grids with named grid areas.

<strong>Extend grid lines</strong>: By default, grid lines are only shown inside the element with <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: inline-grid</code> set on it; when toggling this option on, the grid lines extend to the edge of the viewport along each axis.
Let's examine these settings in more detail.
<h3>&emsp;Show line numbers</h3>

By default, the positive and negative line numbers are displayed on the grid overlay.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/KEEXn0ipZF0I7Y1qNuZs.png">
<h3>&emsp;Hide line labels</h3>

Select <strong>Hide line labels</strong> to hide the line numbers.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/I1QJnFZDFcIflsKBSK8J.png">
<h3>&emsp;Show line names</h3>

You can select <strong>Show line names</strong> to view the line names instead of numbers. In this example, we have 4 lines with names: left, middle1, middle2 and right.
In this demo, <strong>orange</strong> element spans from left to right, with CSS <code>grid-column: left / right</code>. Showing line names make it easier to visualize the start and end position of the element.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/fiQzqCmGbD0acgVNXWyR.png">

<h3>&emsp;Show track sizes</h3>
Enable the <strong>Show track sizes</strong> checkbox to view the track sizes of the grid.
DevTools will display <code>[authored size] - [computed size]</code> in each line label: <strong>Authored</strong> size: The size defined in stylesheet (omitted if not defined). <strong>Computed</strong> size: The actual size on screen.

In this demo, the <code>snack-box</code> column sizes are defined in the CSS <code>grid-template-columns:1fr 2fr;</code>. Therefore, the column line labels show both authored and computed sizes: <strong>1fr - 96.66px</strong> and <strong>2fr - 193.32px</strong>.
The row line labels show only computed sizes: <strong>80px</strong> and <strong>80px</strong> since there are no row sizes defined in the stylesheet.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/RknbkSjXv9ZKgL83nx8N.png">

<h3>&emsp;Show area names</h3>
To view the area names, enable the <strong>Show area names</strong> checkbox. In this example, there are 3 areas in the grid - <strong>top</strong>, <strong>bottom1</strong> and <strong>bottom2</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/iPPMOUBJFtsTyKr0ZcMh.png">

<h3>&emsp;Extend grid lines</h3>
Enable the <strong>Extend grid lines</strong> checkbox to extend the grid lines to the edge of the viewport along each axis.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/OlajZ73i2Y8hlAIZAwFD.png">

<h2>Grid overlays</h2>
The <strong>Grid overlays</strong> section contains a list of grids that are present on the page, each with a checkbox, along with various options.
<h3>&emsp;Enable overlay views of multiple grids</h3>

You can enable overlay views of multiple grids. In this example, there are 2 grid overlays enabled - <code>main</code> and <code>div.snack-box</code>, each represented with different colors.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/GMCjbEkrzZXFfskAqlUe.png">
<h3>&emsp;Customize the grid overlay color</h3>

You can customize each grid overlay color by clicking the color picker.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/GLcwHKYxWT6oQW7rd0HP.png">
<h3>&emsp;Highlight the grid</h3>

Click the highlight icon to immediately highlight the HTML element, scroll to it in the page and select it in the Elements panel.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM</span></h2>

Complete these interactive tutorials to learn the basics of viewing and changing a page's DOM using Chrome DevTools.
This tutorial assumes that you know the difference between the DOM and HTML. See <a href="#appendix">Appendix: HTML versus the DOM</a> for an explanation.
<h2>View DOM nodes</h2>

The DOM Tree of the Elements panel is where you do all DOM-related activities in DevTools.
<h3>&emsp;Inspect a node</h3>
When you're interested in a particular DOM node, <strong>Inspect</strong> is a fast way to open DevTools and investigate that node.

Right-click <strong>Michelangelo</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
Michelangelo
Raphael

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/psbHIPohm8wsZkGA7WXl.png">
The <strong>Elements</strong> panel of DevTools opens. <code>&lt;li&gt;Michelangelo&lt;/li&gt;</code> is highlighted in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/Cz2LKMmJ3sVjkDdfW4i8.png">

Click the <strong>Inspect</strong> 
<img alt="Inspect" src="/web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/shared/inspect.png"> icon in the top-left corner of DevTools.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/2canqdvrgnHBayY1VsLM.png">

Click the <strong>Tokyo</strong> text below.
Tokyo
Beirut

Now, <code>&lt;li&gt;Tokyo&lt;/li&gt;</code> is highlighted in the DOM Tree.
Inspecting a node is also the first step towards viewing and changing a node's styles. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/">Get Started With Viewing And Changing CSS</a>.
<h3>&emsp;Navigate the DOM Tree with a keyboard</h3>

Once you've selected a node in the DOM Tree, you can navigate the DOM Tree with your keyboard.
Right-click <strong>Ringo</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>. <code>&lt;li&gt;Ringo&lt;/li&gt;</code> is selected in the DOM Tree.
George

Ringo
Paul
John

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/6hDrHKpnSMFwCdugWuXR.png">
Press the <kbd>Up</kbd> arrow key 2 times. <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is selected.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/2rwp1VpNq4vDNAM0Q9hR.png">

Press the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key. The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> list collapses.
Press the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key again. The parent of the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> node is selected. In this case it's the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> node containing the instructions for step 1.
Press the <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow key 2 times so that you've re-selected the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> list that you just collapsed. It should look like this: <code>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>

Press the <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key. The list expands.
<h3>&emsp;Scroll into view</h3>
When viewing the DOM Tree, sometimes you'll find yourself interested in a DOM node that's not currently in the viewport. For example, suppose that you scrolled to the bottom of the page, and you're interested in the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> node at the top of the page. <strong>Scroll into view</strong> lets you quickly reposition the viewport so that you can see the node.

Right-click <strong>Magritte</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
Magritte
Soutine

Go to the <a href="#scroll2">Appendix: Scroll into view</a> section at the bottom of this page. The instructions continue there.
After completing the instructions at the bottom of the page you should jump back up to here.
<h3>&emsp;Search for nodes</h3>

You can search the DOM Tree by string, CSS selector, or XPath selector.
Focus your cursor on the <strong>Elements</strong> panel.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Mac). The Search bar opens at the bottom of the DOM Tree.

Type <code>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</code>. The last sentence is highlighted in the DOM Tree.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/qigo04bdlo2evHazfIAp.png">
As mentioned above, the Search bar also supports CSS and XPath selectors.

<h2>Edit the DOM</h2>
You can edit the DOM on the fly and see how those changes affect the page.
<h3>&emsp;Edit content</h3>

To edit a node's content, double-click the content in the DOM Tree.
Right-click <strong>Michelle</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
Fry

Michelle
In the DOM Tree, double-click <code>Michelle</code>. In other words, double-click the text between <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code>. The text is highlighted blue to indicate that it's selected.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/6izVzx17nim6eDn96Vhd.png">

Delete <code>Michelle</code>, type <code>Leela</code>, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the change. The text above changes from <strong>Michelle</strong> to <strong>Leela</strong>.
<h3>&emsp;Edit attributes</h3>
To edit attributes, double-click the attribute name or value. Follow the instructions below to learn how to add attributes to a node.

Right-click <strong>Howard</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
Howard
Vince

Double-click <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. The text is highlighted to indicate that the node is selected.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/U5cgUXHsZ3H9vnL9TmQ0.png">
Press the <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key, add a space, type <code>style="background-color:gold"</code>, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The background color of the node changes to gold.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/7SKDEvndWzq2KPSketg1.png">
<h3>&emsp;Edit node type</h3>
To edit a node's type, double-click the type and then type in the new type.

Right-click <strong>Hank</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
Dean
Hank

Thaddeus
Brock
Double-click <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. The text <code>li</code> is highlighted.

Delete <code>li</code>, type <code>button</code>, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> node changes to a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> node.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/nbdyNWefo9fqESvfWdha.png">
<h3>&emsp;Reorder DOM nodes</h3>

Drag nodes to reorder them.
Right-click <strong>Elvis Presley</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>. Notice that it's the last item in the list.
Stevie Wonder

Tom Waits
Chris Thile
Elvis Presley

In the DOM Tree, drag <code>&lt;li&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/li&gt;</code> to the top of the list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/qD6OQFkcxcKkOZJxHlqB.png">
<h3>&emsp;Force state</h3>

You can force nodes to remain in states like <code>:active</code>, <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, <code>:visited</code>, and <code>:focus-within</code>.
<style>.demo--hover:hover {
    background-color: orange;

  }</style>
Hover over <strong>The Lord of the Flies</strong> below. The background color becomes orange.
The Lord of the Flies

Crime and Punishment
Moby Dick
Right-click <strong>The Lord of the Flies</strong> above and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.

Right-click <code>&lt;li&gt;The Lord of the Flies&lt;/li&gt;</code> and select <strong>Force State</strong> &gt; <strong>:hover</strong>. See <a href="#options">Appendix: Missing options</a> if you don't see this option. The background color remains orange even though you're not actually hovering over the node.
<h3>&emsp;Hide a node</h3>
Press <kbd>H</kbd> to hide a node.

Right-click <strong>The Stars My Destination</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
The Count of Monte Cristo
The Stars My Destination

Press the <kbd>H</kbd> key. The node is hidden.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/ynrZooiPHy2DUBbdGL3k.png">
Press the <kbd>H</kbd> key again. The node is shown again.

<h3>&emsp;Delete a node</h3>
Press <kbd>Delete</kbd> to delete a node.
Right-click <strong>Foundation</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.

The Illustrated Man
Through the Looking-Glass
Foundation

Press the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key. The node is deleted.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> (Mac). The last action is undone and the node reappears.
<h2>Access nodes in the Console</h2>

DevTools provides a few shortcuts for accessing DOM nodes from the Console, or getting JavaScript references to them.
<h3>&emsp;Reference the currently-selected node with $0</h3>
When you inspect a node, the <code>== $0</code> text next to the node means that you can reference this node in the Console with the variable <code>$0</code>.

Right-click <strong>The Left Hand of Darkness</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
The Left Hand of Darkness
Dune

Press the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key to open the Console Drawer.
Type <code>$0</code> and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. The result of the expression shows that <code>$0</code> evaluates to <code>&lt;li&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/li&gt;</code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/y3AQHZHbv25cRX1AJt4E.png">

Hover over the result. The node is highlighted in the viewport.
Click <code>&lt;li&gt;Dune&lt;/li&gt;</code> in the DOM Tree, type <code>$0</code> in the Console again, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again. Now, <code>$0</code> evaluates to <code>&lt;li&gt;Dune&lt;/li&gt;</code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/AJpUgl9zL9w4skXkaDEE.png">

<h3>&emsp;Store as global variable</h3>
If you need to refer back to a node many times, store it as a global variable.
Right-click <strong>The Big Sleep</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.

The Big Sleep
The Long Goodbye
Right-click <code>&lt;li&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/li&gt;</code> in the DOM Tree and select <strong>Store as global variable</strong>. See <a href="#options">Appendix: Missing options</a> if you don't see this option.

Type <code>temp1</code> in the Console and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The result of the expression shows that the variable evaluates to the node.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/hDCScCM1db0EnAM0VYAZ.png">
<h3>&emsp;Copy JS path</h3>

Copy the JavaScript path to a node when you need to reference it in an automated test.
Right-click <strong>The Brothers Karamazov</strong> below and select <strong>Inspect</strong>.
The Brothers Karamazov

Crime and Punishment
Right-click <code>&lt;li&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/li&gt;</code> in the DOM Tree and select <strong>Copy</strong> &gt; <strong>Copy JS Path</strong>. A <code>document.querySelector()</code> expression that resolves to the node has been copied to your clipboard.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (Mac) to paste the expression into the Console.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to evaluate the expression.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/r2zpHdCY7TQ0mMzRg3Ov.png">
<h2>Break on DOM changes</h2>

DevTools allows you to pause a page's JavaScript when the JavaScript modifies the DOM. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/#dom">DOM change breakpoints</a>.
<h2>Next steps</h2>
That covers most of the DOM-related features in DevTools. You can discover the rest of them by right-clicking nodes in the DOM Tree and experimenting with the other options that weren't covered in this tutorial. See also <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/shortcuts#elements">Elements panel keyboard shortcuts</a>.

Check out the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/">Chrome DevTools homepage</a> to discover everything else you can do with DevTools.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#community">Community</a> if you want to contact the DevTools team or get help from the DevTools community.
<h2>Appendix: HTML versus the DOM</h2>

This section quickly explains the difference between HTML and the DOM.
When you use a web browser to request a page like <code>https://example.com</code> the server returns HTML like this:
<code><span><span>&lt;!</span><span>doctype</span> <span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Hello, world!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Hello, world!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is a hypertext document on the World Wide Web.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/script.js<span>"</span></span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code>

The browser parses the HTML and creates a tree of objects like this:
<code>html<br>  head<br>    title<br>  body<br>    h1<br>    p<br>    script</code>
This tree of objects, or nodes, representing the page's content is called the DOM. Right now it looks the same as the HTML, but suppose that the script referenced at the bottom of the HTML runs this code:

<code><span>const</span> h1 <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>h1<span>.</span>parentElement<span>.</span><span>removeChild</span><span>(</span>h1<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> p <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'p'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>p<span>.</span>textContent <span>=</span> <span>'Wildcard!'</span><span>;</span><br>document<span>.</span>body<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>p<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
That code removes the <code>h1</code> node and adds another <code>p</code> node to the DOM. The complete DOM now looks like this:
<code>html<br>  head<br>    title<br>  body<br>    p<br>    script<br>    p</code>

The page's HTML is now different than its DOM. In other words, HTML represents initial page content, and the DOM represents current page content. When JavaScript adds, removes, or edits nodes, the DOM becomes different than the HTML.
See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">Introduction to the DOM</a> to learn more.
<h2>Appendix: Scroll into view</h2>

This is a continuation of the <a href="#scroll1">Scroll into view</a> section. Follow the instructions below to complete the section.
The <code>&lt;li&gt;Magritte&lt;/li&gt;</code> node should still be selected in your DOM Tree. If not, go back to <a href="#scroll1">Scroll into view</a> and start over.
Right-click the <code>&lt;li&gt;Magritte&lt;/li&gt;</code> node and select <strong>Scroll into view</strong>. Your viewport scrolls back up so that you can see the <strong>Magritte</strong> node. See <a href="#options">Appendix: Missing options</a> if you can't see the <strong>Scroll into view</strong> option.

<h2>Appendix: Missing options</h2>
Many of the instructions in this tutorial instruct you to right-click a node in the DOM Tree and then select an option from the context menu that pops up. If you don't see the specified option in the context menu, try right-clicking away from the node text.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Console overview</span></h2>

This page explains how the Chrome DevTools Console makes it easier to develop web pages. The Console has 2 main uses: <a href="#view">viewing logged messages</a> and <a href="#javascript">running JavaScript</a>.
<h2>Viewing logged messages</h2>
Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you insert an expression like <code>console.log('Hello, Console!')</code> into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console. For example, suppose that you're in the process of writing the HTML and JavaScript for a page:

<code><span><span>&lt;!</span><span>doctype</span> <span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Console Demo<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Hello, World!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Loading!'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> h1 <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>h1<span>.</span>textContent<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>      console<span>.</span><span>assert</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'h2'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'h2 not found!'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> artists <span>=</span> <span>[</span><br><span>{</span><br>          first<span>:</span> <span>'René'</span><span>,</span><br>          last<span>:</span> <span>'Magritte'</span><br><span>}</span><span>,</span><br><span>{</span><br>          first<span>:</span> <span>'Chaim'</span><span>,</span><br>          last<span>:</span> <span>'Soutine'</span><br><span>}</span><span>,</span><br><span>{</span><br>          first<span>:</span> <span>'Henri'</span><span>,</span><br>          last<span>:</span> <span>'Matisse'</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>      console<span>.</span><span>table</span><span>(</span>artists<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>        h1<span>.</span>textContent <span>=</span> <span>'Hello, Console!'</span><span>;</span><br>        console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>h1<span>.</span>textContent<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>3000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code>
<strong>Figure 1</strong> shows what the Console looks like after loading the page and waiting 3 seconds. Try to figure out which lines of code caused the browser to log the messages.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dpOohQpnFAKdK0JpVvuv.png">

<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The Console panel.
Web developers log messages for 2 general reasons:
Making sure that code is executing in the right order.

Inspecting the values of variables at a certain moment in time.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/log/">Get Started With Logging Messages</a> to get hands-on experience with logging. See the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/api/">Console API Reference</a> to browse the full list of <code>console</code> methods. The main difference between the methods is how they display the data that you're logging.
<h2>Running JavaScript</h2>

The Console is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>. You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting. For example, <strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the Console next to the DevTools homepage, and <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows that same page after using the Console to change the page's title.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/HsESeWdYC1Yck5qTtzkj.png">
<strong>Figure 2</strong>. The Console panel next to the DevTools homepage.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Diu3Bq4TbPWb9Y5gr7HX.png">
<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Using the Console to change the page's title.
Modifying the page from the Console is possible because the Console has full access to the page's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"><code>window</code></a>. DevTools has a few convenience functions that make it easier to inspect a page. For example, suppose that your JavaScript contains a function called <code>hideModal</code>. Running <code>debug(hideModal)</code> pauses your code on the first line of <code>hideModal</code> the next time that it's called. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/utilities#debug">Console Utilities API Reference</a> to see the full list of utility functions.

When you run JavaScript you don't have to interact with the page. You can use the Console to try out new code that's not related to the page. For example, suppose you just learned about the built-in JavaScript Array method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"><code>map()</code></a>, and you want to experiment with it. The Console is a good place to try out the function.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/javascript/">Get Started With Running JavaScript</a> to get hands-on experience with running JavaScript in the Console.

<h2>View messages logged from JavaScript</h2>
Most messages that you see in the Console come from the web developers who wrote the page's JavaScript. The goal of this section is to introduce you to the different message types that you're likely to see in the Console, and explain how you can log each message type yourself from your own JavaScript.

Click the <strong>Log Info</strong> button in the demo. <code>Hello, Console!</code> gets logged to the Console.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/lSamfDnGqrNC6rau3zvT.png">
<strong>Figure 6</strong>. The Console after clicking <strong>Log Info</strong>.

Next to the <code>Hello, Console!</code> message in the Console click <strong>log.js:2</strong>. The Sources panel opens and highlights the line of code that caused the message to get logged to the Console. The message was logged when the page's JavaScript called <code>console.log('Hello, Console!')</code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/VjLF6UMfP0uWeDahvUVo.png">
<strong>Figure 7</strong>. DevTools opens the Sources panel after you click <strong>log.js:2</strong>.

Navigate back to the Console using any of the following workflows:
Click the <strong>Console</strong> tab.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> (Mac) until the Console panel is in focus.

<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/command-menu/">Open the Command Menu</a>, start typing <code>Console</code>, select the <strong>Show Console Panel</strong> command, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Click the <strong>Log Warning</strong> button in the demo. <code>Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter</code> gets logged to the Console. Messages formatted like this are warnings.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/77aEDWR3djItzJLVcq9f.png">

<strong>Figure 8</strong>. The Console after clicking <strong>Log Warning</strong>.
Optional: Click <strong>log.js:12</strong> to view the code that caused the message to get formatted like this, and then navigate back to Console when you're finished. Do this whenever you want to see the code that caused a message to get logged a certain way.

<strong>Figure 9</strong>. A stack trace.

The stack trace is telling you that a function named <code>logWarning</code> was called, which in turn called a function named <code>quoteDante</code>. In other words, the call that happened first is at the bottom of the stack trace. You can log stack traces at any time by calling <code>console.trace()</code>.
Click <strong>Log Error</strong>. The following error message gets logged: <code>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.</code>

<strong>Figure 13</strong>. A message with custom formatting in the Console.
The main idea here is that when you want to log messages to the Console from your JavaScript, you use one of the <code>console</code> methods. Each method formats messages differently.
There are even more methods than what has been demonstrated in this section. At the end of the tutorial you'll learn how to explore the rest of the methods.

<h2>View messages logged by the browser</h2>
The browser logs messages to the Console, too. This usually happens when there's a problem with the page.
Click <strong>Cause 404</strong>. The browser logs a <code>404</code> network error because the page's JavaScript tried to fetch a file that doesn't exist.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/EypVyz8F9a1eNlEkjvro.png">
<strong>Figure 14</strong>. A 404 error in the Console.
Click <strong>Cause Error</strong>. The browser logs an uncaught <code>TypeError</code> because the JavaScript is trying to update a DOM node that doesn't exist.

<strong>Figure 15</strong>. A TypeError in the Console.
Click the <strong>Log Levels</strong> dropdown and enable the <strong>Verbose</strong> option if it's disabled. You'll learn more about filtering in the next section. You need to do this to make sure that the next message you log is visible. <strong>Note:</strong> If the Default Levels dropdown is disabled, you may need to close the Console Sidebar. Filter by Message Source below for more information about the Console Sidebar.

<strong>Figure 16</strong>. Enabling the <strong>Verbose</strong> log level.
Click <strong>Cause Violation</strong>. The page becomes unresponsive for a few seconds and then the browser logs the message <code>[Violation] 'click' handler took 3000ms</code> to the Console. The exact duration may vary.

<strong>Figure 17</strong>. A violation in the Console.
<h2>Filter messages</h2>

On some pages you'll see the Console get flooded with messages. DevTools provides many different ways to filter out messages that aren't relevant to the task at hand.
<h3>&emsp;Filter by log level</h3>
Each <code>console</code> method is assigned a severity level: <code>Verbose</code>, <code>Info</code>, <code>Warning</code>, or <code>Error</code>. For example, <code>console.log()</code> is an <code>Info</code>-level message, whereas <code>console.error()</code> is an <code>Error</code>-level message.

Click the <strong>Log Levels</strong> dropdown and disable <strong>Errors</strong>. A level is disabled when there is no longer a checkmark next to it. The <code>Error</code>-level messages disappear.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/t1U5iAP8oKCS0nlwaOZy.png">
<strong>Figure 18</strong>. Disabling <code>Error</code>-level messages in the Console.

Click the <strong>Log Levels</strong> dropdown again and re-enable <strong>Errors</strong>. The <code>Error</code>-level messages reappear.
<h3>&emsp;Filter by text</h3>
When you want to only view messages that include an exact string, type that string into the <strong>Filter</strong> text box.

Type <code>Dave</code> into the <strong>Filter</strong> text box. All messages that do not include the string <code>Dave</code> are hidden. You might also see the <code>Adolescent Irradiated Espionage Tortoises</code> label. That's a bug.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/8LQhiX8sS9tLJbMZZOWi.png">
<strong>Figure 19</strong>. Filtering out any message that does not include <code>Dave</code>.

Delete <code>Dave</code> from the <strong>Filter</strong> text box. All the messages reappear.
<h3>&emsp;Filter by regular expression</h3>
When you want to show all messages that include a pattern of text, rather than a specific string, use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">regular expression</a>.

Type <code>/^[AH]/</code> into the <strong>Filter</strong> text box. Type this pattern into <a href="https://regexr.com">RegExr</a> for an explanation of what it's doing.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/3xsXUFoTlcJSrLzJ97GR.png">
<strong>Figure 20</strong>. Filtering out any message that does not match the pattern <code>/^[AH]/</code>.

Delete <code>/^[AH]/</code> from the <strong>Filter</strong> text box. All messages are visible again.
<h3>&emsp;Filter by message source</h3>
When you want to only view the messages that came from a certain URL, use the <strong>Sidebar</strong>.

Click <strong>Show Console Sidebar</strong>

<strong>Figure 22</strong>. Viewing the source of messages in the Sidebar.
<h3>&emsp;Filter by user messages</h3>
Earlier, when you clicked <strong>Log Info</strong>, a script called <code>console.log('Hello, Console!')</code> in order to log the message to the Console. Messages logged from JavaScript like this are called <em>user messages</em>. In contrast, when you clicked <strong>Cause 404</strong>, the browser logged an <code>Error</code>-level message stating that the requested resource could not be found. Messages like that are considered <em>browser messages</em>. You can use the <strong>Sidebar</strong> to filter out browser messages and only show user messages.

Click <strong>9 User Messages</strong>. The browser messages are hidden.

<h2>Use the Console alongside any other panel</h2>
What if you're editing styles, but you need to quickly check the Console log for something? Use the Drawer.

Click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.
Press <kbd>Escape</kbd>. The Console tab of the <strong>Drawer</strong> opens. It has all of the features of the Console panel that you've been using throughout this tutorial.

This interactive tutorial shows you how to run JavaScript in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/">Chrome DevTools</a> Console. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/log/">Get Started With Logging Messages</a> to learn how to log messages to the Console. See Debugging JavaScript to learn how to pause JavaScript code and step through it one line at a time.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/niTYZhvjmKcUZpMZmuOV.png">
<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The <strong>Console</strong>.
<h2>Overview</h2>

The <strong>Console</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>, which stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. It reads the JavaScript that you type into it, evaluates your code, prints out the result of your <a href="http://2ality.com/2012/09/expressions-vs-statements.html">expression</a>, and then loops back to the first step.
<h2>Set up DevTools</h2>
This tutorial is designed so that you can open up the demo and try all the workflows yourself. When you physically follow along, you're more likely to remember the workflows later.

Press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the <strong>Console</strong>, right here on this very page.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/5aHOGjzCHY5tHEnye4lU.png">
<strong>Figure 2</strong>. This tutorial on the left, and DevTools on the right.

<h2>View and change the page's JavaScript or DOM</h2>
When building or debugging a page, it's often useful to run statements in the <strong>Console</strong> in order to change how the page looks or runs.
Notice the text in the button below.

<button>Hello, World!</button>
Type <code>document.getElementById('hello').textContent = 'Hello, Console!'</code> in the <strong>Console</strong> and then press Enter to evaluate the expression. Notice how the text inside the button changes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/7AFYFztno8K9z7C7rXZm.png">

<strong>Figure 3</strong>. How the Console looks after evaluating the expression above.
Below the code that you evaluated you see <code>"Hello, Console!"</code>. Recall the 4 steps of REPL: read, evaluate, print, loop. After evaluating your code, a REPL prints the result of the expression. So <code>"Hello, Console!"</code> must be the result of evaluating <code>document.getElementById('hello').textContent = 'Hello, Console!'</code>.
<h2>Run arbitrary JavaScript that's not related to the page</h2>

Sometimes, you just want a code playground where you can test some code, or try out new JavaScript features you're not familiar with. The Console is a perfect place for these kinds of experiments.
Type <code>5 + 15</code> in the Console and press Enter to evaluate the expression. The Console prints out the result of the expression below your code. <strong>Figure 4</strong> below shows how your Console should look after evaluating this expression.
Type the following code into the <strong>Console</strong>. Try typing it out, character-by-character, rather than copy-pasting it.

<code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b<span>=</span><span>20</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>
See <a href="http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues">define default values for function arguments</a> if you're unfamiliar with the <code>b=20</code> syntax.
Now, call the function that you just defined.

<code><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/3V5mx06Kehe06nGL3csv.png">
<strong>Figure 4</strong>. How the Console looks after evaluating the expressions above.

<code>add(25)</code> evaluates to <code>45</code> because when the <code>add</code> function is called without a second argument, <code>b</code> defaults to <code>20</code>.

See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/reference#js">Run JavaScript</a> to explore more features related to running JavaScript in the Console.

DevTools lets you pause a script in the middle of its execution. While you're paused, you can use the <strong>Console</strong> to view and change the page's <code>window</code> or <code>DOM</code> at that moment in time. This makes for a powerful debugging workflow. See Debugging JavaScript for an interactive tutorial.
The <strong>Console</strong> also has a set of convenience functions that make it easier to interact with a page. For example:
Rather than typing <code>document.querySelector()</code> to select an element, you can type <code>$()</code>. This syntax is inspired by jQuery, but it's not actually jQuery. It's just an alias for <code>document.querySelector()</code>.

<code>debug(function)</code> effectively sets a breakpoint on the first line of that function.
<code>keys(object)</code> returns an array containing the keys of the specified object.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/utilities/">Console Utilities API Reference</a> to explore all the convenience functions.

<h2>View messages</h2>
This section contains features that change how messages are presented in the Console. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/#view">View messages</a> for a hands-on walkthrough.
<h3>&emsp;Disable message grouping</h3>

<a href="#settings">Open Console Settings</a> and disable <strong>Group similar</strong> to disable the Console's default message grouping behavior. See <a href="#xhr">Log XHR and Fetch requests</a> for an example.
<h3>&emsp;Log XHR and Fetch requests</h3>
<a href="#settings">Open Console Settings</a> and enable <strong>Log XMLHttpRequests</strong> to log all <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>Fetch</code> requests to the Console as they happen.

<h3>&emsp;Persist messages across page loads</h3>

By default the Console clears whenever you load a new page. To persist messages across page loads, <a href="#settings">Open Console Settings</a> and then enable the <strong>Preserve Log</strong> checkbox.
<h3>&emsp;Hide network messages</h3>
By default the browser logs network messages to the <strong>Console</strong>. For example, the top message in <strong>Figure X</strong> represents a 404.

To hide network messages:

<a href="#settings">Open Console Settings</a>.
Enable the <strong>Hide Network</strong> checkbox.
<h2>Filter messages</h2>

There are many ways to filter out messages in the Console.
<h3>&emsp;Filter out browser messages</h3>
<a href="#sidebar">Open the Console Sidebar</a> and click <strong>User Messages</strong> to only show messages that came from the page's JavaScript.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/mYDvN18HyYlZszVGzp1F.png">
<strong>Figure 11</strong>. Viewing user messages.
<h3>&emsp;Filter by log level</h3>

DevTools assigns each <code>console.*</code> method a severity level. There are 4 levels: <code>Verbose</code>, <code>Info</code>, <code>Warning</code>, and <code>Error</code>. For example, <code>console.log()</code> is in the <code>Info</code> group, whereas <code>console.error()</code> is in the <code>Error</code> group. The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/api/">Console API Reference</a> describes the severity level of each applicable method. Every message that the browser logs to the Console has a severity level too. You can hide any level of messages that you're not interested in. For example, if you're only interested in <code>Error</code> messages, you can hide the other 3 groups.
Click the <strong>Log Levels</strong> dropdown to enable or disable <code>Verbose</code>, <code>Info</code>, <code>Warning</code> or <code>Error</code> messages.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/PX52vbEI6gTFqSmTZNVB.png">

<strong>Figure 12</strong>. The <strong>Log Levels</strong> dropdown.
You can also filter by log level by <a href="#sidebar">opening the Console Sidebar</a> and then clicking <strong>Errors</strong>, <strong>Warnings</strong>, <strong>Info</strong>, or <strong>Verbose</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/osvdtWq0DGX1yjkFDGLZ.png">

<strong>Figure 13</strong>. Using the Sidebar to view warnings.
<h3>&emsp;Filter messages by URL</h3>
Type <code>url:</code> followed by a URL to only view messages that came from that URL. After you type <code>url:</code> DevTools shows all relevant URLs. Domains also work. For example, if <code>https://example.com/a.js</code> and <code>https://example.com/b.js</code> are logging messages, <code>url:https://example.com</code> enables you to focus on the messages from these 2 scripts.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/VEumwMRJ7kuQDV3JFtQk.png">
<strong>Figure 14</strong>. A URL filter.
Type <code>-url:</code> to hide messages from that URL. This is called a negative URL filter.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://b.wal.co</code>.
You can also show messages from a single URL by <a href="#sidebar">opening the Console Sidebar</a>, expanding the <strong>User Messages</strong> section, and then clicking the URL of the script containing the messages you want to focus on.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/7d3qjmCPUgkXVsg1rVf1.png">

<strong>Figure 16</strong>. Viewing the messages that came from <code>wp-ad.min.js</code>.
<h3>&emsp;Filter out messages from different contexts</h3>
Suppose that you've got an ad on your page. The ad is embedded in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and is generating a lot of messages in your Console. Because this ad is in a different <a href="#context">JavaScript context</a>, one way to hide its messages is to <a href="#settings">open Console Settings</a> and enable the <strong>Selected Context Only</strong> checkbox.

<h3>&emsp;Filter out messages that don't match a regular expression pattern</h3>
Type a regular expression such as <code>/[foo]\s[bar]/</code> in the <strong>Filter</strong> text box to filter out any messages that don't match that pattern. Spaces are not supported, use <code>\s</code> instead. DevTools checks if the pattern is found in the message text or the script that caused the message to be logged.

<h2>Run JavaScript</h2>
This section contains features related to running JavaScript in the Console. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/#javascript">Run JavaScript</a> for a hands-on walkthrough.

<h3>&emsp;Re-run expressions from history</h3>
Press the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> key to cycle through the history of JavaScript expressions that you ran earlier in the Console. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run that expression again.
<h3>&emsp;Watch an expression's value in real-time with Live Expressions</h3>

If you find yourself typing the same JavaScript expression in the Console repeatedly, you might find it easier to create a <strong>Live Expression</strong>. With <strong>Live Expressions</strong> you type an expression once and then pin it to the top of your Console. The value of the expression updates in near real-time. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/live-expressions/">Watch JavaScript Expression Values In Real-Time With Live Expressions</a>.
<h3>&emsp;Disable Eager Evaluation</h3>
As you type JavaScript expressions in the Console, <strong>Eager Evaluation</strong> shows a preview of that expression's return value. <a href="#settings">Open Console Settings</a> and disable the <strong>Eager Evaluation</strong> checkbox to turn off the return value previews.

<h3>&emsp;Disable autocomplete from history</h3>
As you type out an expression, the Console's autocomplete popup shows expressions that you ran earlier. These expressions are prepended with the <code>&gt;</code> character. <a href="#settings">Open Console Settings</a> and disable the <strong>Autocomplete From History</strong> checkbox to stop showing expressions from your history.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Console Utilities API reference</span></h2>
The Console Utilities API contains a collection of convenience functions for performing common tasks: selecting and inspecting DOM elements, displaying data in readable format, stopping and starting the profiler, and monitoring DOM events.

<span>Warning</span>
<strong>Warning:</strong> These functions only work when you call them from the Chrome DevTools Console. They won't work if you try to call them in your scripts.
Looking for <code>console.log()</code>, <code>console.error()</code>, and the rest of the <code>console.*</code> functions? See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/api/">Console API Reference</a>.

<h2>$_</h2>
<code>$_</code> returns the value of the most recently evaluated expression.
In the following example, a simple expression (<code>2 + 2</code>) is evaluated. The <code>$_</code> property is then evaluated, which contains the same value:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/TfgjCE7ayHU8lwJJTFss.png">
In the next example, the evaluated expression initially contains an array of names. Evaluating <code>$_.length</code> to find the length of the array, the value stored in <code>$_</code> changes to become the latest evaluated expression, 4:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/d2jU3P5gc4G2OuK4PMQ1.png">

<h2>$0 - $4</h2>
The <code>$0</code>, <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code> and <code>$4</code> commands work as a historical reference to the last five DOM elements inspected within the Elements panel or the last five JavaScript heap objects selected in the Profiles panel. <code>$0</code> returns the most recently selected element or JavaScript object, <code>$1</code> returns the second most recently selected one, and so on.
In the following example, an <code>img</code> element is selected in the Elements panel. In the Console drawer, <code>$0</code> has been evaluated and displays the same element:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/v9jdOozAkvhutIYnejJl.png">
The image below shows a different element selected in the same page. The <code>$0</code> now refers to newly selected element, while <code>$1</code> returns the previously selected one:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ET1JJFtUIXvaoPCGQ94C.png">

<h2>$(selector, [startNode])</h2>
<code>$(selector)</code> returns the reference to the first DOM element with the specified CSS selector. When called with one argument, this function is an alias for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector">document.querySelector()</a> function.
The following example returns a reference to the first <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element in the document:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/poVWF9iRLAYZ08O2t88S.png">
Right-click on the returned result and select 'Reveal in Elements Panel' to find it in the DOM, or 'Scroll in to View' to show it on the page.
The following example returns a reference to the currently selected element and displays its src property:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/TLcKoLAXcrFcOgSPnNaD.png">
This function also supports a second parameter, startNode, that specifies an 'element' or Node from which to search for elements. The default value of this parameter is <code>document</code>.
The following example returns a reference to the first element after the currently selected Node and displays its src properly:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Q5XlmeIMaHQkpP1QryBd.png">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are using a library such as jQuery that uses <code>$</code>, this functionality will be overwritten, and <code>$</code> will correspond to that library's implementation.
<h2>$$(selector, [startNode])</h2>

<code>$$(selector)</code> returns an array of elements that match the given CSS selector. This command is equivalent to calling <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll">document.querySelectorAll()</a>.
The following example uses <code>$$()</code> to create an array of all <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements in the current document and displays the value of each element's <code>src</code> property:
<code><span>let</span> images <span>=</span> <span>$$</span><span>(</span><span>'img'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> each <span>of</span> images<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>each<span>.</span>src<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/f3W2BdYq3PAl435AMXso.png">
This function also supports a second parameter, startNode, that specifies an element or Node from which to search for elements. The default value of this parameter is <code>document</code>.
This modified version of the previous example uses <code>$$()</code> to create an array of all <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements that appear in the current document after the selected Node:

<code><span>let</span> images <span>=</span> <span>$$</span><span>(</span><span>'img'</span><span>,</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'.devsite-header-background'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> each <span>of</span> images<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>each<span>.</span>src<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/MKKFwNfiqaq8JPUkgchF.png">
<strong>Note:</strong> Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the console to start a new line without executing the script.

<h2>$x(path, [startNode])</h2>
<code>$x(path)</code> returns an array of DOM elements that match the given XPath expression.
For example, the following returns all the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements on the page:

<code><span>$x</span><span>(</span><span>"//p"</span><span>)</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/8fIwlT9ZWd9109E9jyRb.png">
The following example returns all the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements that contain <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements:

<code><span>$x</span><span>(</span><span>"//p[a]"</span><span>)</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/qvqloRRfS4IU1WhDsJkP.png">
Similar to the other selector functions, <code>$x(path)</code> has an optional second parameter, <code>startNode</code>, that specifies an element or Node from which to search for elements.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/srYQFy4Y7TRlT0kGarUN.png">
<h2>clear()</h2>
<code>clear()</code> clears the console of its history.

<code><span>clear</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<h2>copy(object)</h2>
<code>copy(object)</code> copies a string representation of the specified object to the clipboard.

<code><span>copy</span><span>(</span>$<span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<h2>debug(function)</h2>
When the specified function is called, the debugger is invoked and breaks inside the function on the Sources panel allowing to step through the code and debug it.

<code><span>debug</span><span>(</span>getData<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dhPBjuzWvsEbHeGR5NpQ.png">
Use <code>undebug(fn)</code> to stop breaking on the function, or use the UI to disable all breakpoints.

For more information on breakpoints, see Pause Your Code With Breakpoints.
<h2>dir(object)</h2>
<code>dir(object)</code> displays an object-style listing of all the specified object's properties. This method is an alias for the Console API's <code>console.dir()</code> method.

The following example shows the difference between evaluating <code>document.body</code> directly in the command line, and using <code>dir()</code> to display the same element:
<code>document<span>.</span>body<span>;</span><br><span>dir</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/api/#dir"><code>console.dir()</code></a> entry in the Console API.

<h2>dirxml(object)</h2>
<code>dirxml(object)</code> prints an XML representation of the specified object, as seen in the Elements tab. This method is equivalent to the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/api/#dirxml"><code>console.dirxml()</code></a> method.
<h2>inspect(object/function)</h2>

<code>inspect(object/function)</code> opens and selects the specified element or object in the appropriate panel: either the Elements panel for DOM elements or the Profiles panel for JavaScript heap objects.
The following example opens the <code>document.body</code> in the Elements panel:
<code><span>inspect</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/BDFR3iEMqRnWIWrrVEu6.png">
When passing a function to inspect, the function opens the document up in the Sources panel for you to inspect.
<h2>getEventListeners(object)</h2>

<code>getEventListeners(object)</code> returns the event listeners registered on the specified object. The return value is an object that contains an array for each registered event type (<code>click</code> or <code>keydown</code>, for example). The members of each array are objects that describe the listener registered for each type. For example, the following lists all the event listeners registered on the document object:
<code><span>getEventListeners</span><span>(</span>document<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/pVhvAi37yxLejbODHGSZ.png">

If more than one listener is registered on the specified object, then the array contains a member for each listener. In the following example, there are two event listeners registered on the document element for the <code>click</code> event:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Hlh3CErBYJTTNg9butfj.png">
You can further expand each of these objects to explore their properties:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/EJnoDfrKGIhwz7cx0WE3.png">
<h2>keys(object)</h2>
<code>keys(object)</code> returns an array containing the names of the properties belonging to the specified object. To get the associated values of the same properties, use <code>values()</code>.

For example, suppose your application defined the following object:
<code><span>let</span> player1 <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Ted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"level"</span><span>:</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></code>
Assuming <code>player1</code> was defined in the global namespace (for simplicity), typing <code>keys(player1)</code> and <code>values(player1)</code> in the console results in the following:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/HYEKFYyD93YzGLoF2avv.png">
<h2>monitor(function)</h2>
When the function specified is called, a message is logged to the console that indicates the function name along with the arguments that are passed to the function when it was called.

<code><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>x<span>,</span> y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>return</span> x <span>+</span> y<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>monitor</span><span>(</span>sum<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/V28TFRjUqryt2u3b2zls.png">
Use <code>unmonitor(function)</code> to cease monitoring.

<h2>monitorEvents(object[, events])</h2>
When one of the specified events occurs on the specified object, the Event object is logged to the console. You can specify a single event to monitor, an array of events, or one of the generic events "types" mapped to a predefined collection of events. See examples below.
The following monitors all resize events on the window object.

<code><span>monitorEvents</span><span>(</span>window<span>,</span> <span>"resize"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ZrU8M58cKhN2eZRpiNVI.png">
The following defines an array to monitor both "resize" and "scroll" events on the window object:

<code><span>monitorEvents</span><span>(</span>window<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>"resize"</span><span>,</span> <span>"scroll"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code>
You can also specify one of the available event "types", strings that map to predefined sets of events. The table below lists the available event types and their associated event mappings:
<table>
<thead><tr><th colspan="2">Event type &amp; Corresponding mapped events</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>mouse</td><td>"mousedown", "mouseup", "click", "dblclick", "mousemove", "mouseover", "mouseout", "mousewheel"</td></tr>
<tr><td>key</td><td>"keydown", "keyup", "keypress", "textInput"</td></tr>
<tr><td>touch</td>
<td>"touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend", "touchcancel"</td></tr>
<tr><td>control</td><td>"resize", "scroll", "zoom", "focus", "blur", "select", "change", "submit", "reset"</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
For example, the following uses the "key" event type all corresponding key events on an input text field currently selected in the Elements panel.

<code><span>monitorEvents</span><span>(</span>$<span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>"key"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
Below is sample output after typing a characters in the text field:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Shs04IRgNP87cbbjCbtd.png">

<h2>profile([name]) and profileEnd([name])</h2>
<code>profile()</code> starts a JavaScript CPU profiling session with an optional name. <code>profileEnd()</code> completes the profile and displays the results in the Profile panel. (See also <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/rendering-tools/js-execution/">Speed Up JavaScript Execution</a>.)
To start profiling:

<code><span>profile</span><span>(</span><span>"My profile"</span><span>)</span></code>
To stop profiling and display the results in the Profiles panel:
<code><span>profileEnd</span><span>(</span><span>"My profile"</span><span>)</span></code>

Profiles can also be nested. For example, this will work in any order:
<code><span>profile</span><span>(</span><span>'A'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>profile</span><span>(</span><span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>profileEnd</span><span>(</span><span>'A'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>profileEnd</span><span>(</span><span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
Result in the profiles panel:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/BWxxLJby5scm6zF0eidW.png">
<strong>Note:</strong> Multiple CPU profiles can operate at once and you aren't required to close them out in creation order.
<h2>queryObjects(Constructor)</h2>

Call <code>queryObjects(Constructor)</code> from the console to return an array of objects that were created with the specified constructor. For example:
<code>queryObjects(Promise)</code>. Returns all instances of <code>Promise</code>.
<code>queryObjects(HTMLElement)</code>. Returns all HTML elements.

<code>queryObjects(foo)</code>, where <code>foo</code> is a class name. Returns all objects that were instantiated via <code>new foo()</code>.
The scope of <code>queryObjects()</code> is the currently-selected execution context in the console.
<h2>table(data[, columns])</h2>

Log object data with table formatting by passing in a data object in with optional column headings. For example, to display a list of names using a table in the console, you would do:
<code><span>let</span> names <span>=</span> <span>[</span><br><span>{</span> firstName<span>:</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> lastName<span>:</span> <span>"Smith"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span><br><span>{</span> firstName<span>:</span> <span>"Jane"</span><span>,</span> lastName<span>:</span> <span>"Doe"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span><br><span>]</span><span>;</span><br><span>table</span><span>(</span>names<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<h2>undebug(function)</h2>
<code>undebug(function)</code> stops the debugging of the specified function so that when the function is called, the debugger is no longer invoked. This is used in concert with <code>debug(fn)</code>.
<code><span>undebug</span><span>(</span>getData<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<h2>unmonitor(function)</h2>
<code>unmonitor(function)</code> stops the monitoring of the specified function. This is used in concert with <code>monitor(fn)</code>.
<code><span>unmonitor</span><span>(</span>getData<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<h2>unmonitorEvents(object[, events])</h2>
<code>unmonitorEvents(object[, events])</code> stops monitoring events for the specified object and events. For example, the following stops all event monitoring on the window object:
<code><span>unmonitorEvents</span><span>(</span>window<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

You can also selectively stop monitoring specific events on an object. For example, the following code starts monitoring all mouse events on the currently selected element, and then stops monitoring "mousemove" events (perhaps to reduce noise in the console output):
<code><span>monitorEvents</span><span>(</span>$<span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>"mouse"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>unmonitorEvents</span><span>(</span>$<span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>"mousemove"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<h2>values(object)</h2>
<code>values(object)</code> returns an array containing the values of all properties belonging to the specified object.
<code><span>values</span><span>(</span>object<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<h2><br><span class="orange">Find Unused JavaScript And CSS With The Coverage Tab</span></h2>
The Coverage tab in Chrome DevTools can help you find unused JavaScript and CSS code. Removing unused code can speed up your page load and save your mobile users cellular data.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/0g2WvpbGRGdVs0aAPc6ObG7gkud2/IzpB7injykyaq8PRDVwF.png">
<b>Figure 1</b>. Analyzing code coverage.
<span>Caution</span>
A word of warning. Finding unused code is relatively easy. But refactoring a codebase so that each page only ships the JavaScript and CSS that it needs can be difficult. This guide doesn't cover how to refactor a codebase to avoid unused code because these refactors depend highly on your technology stack.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Shipping unused JavaScript or CSS is a common problem in web development. For example, suppose that you want to use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/buttons/">Bootstrap's button component</a> on your page. To use the button component you need to add a link to Bootstrap's stylesheet in your HTML, like this:
<code>...<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  ...<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>stylesheet<span>"</span></span><br><span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css<span>"</span></span><br><span>integrity</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T<span>"</span></span><br><span>crossorigin</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>anonymous<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  ...<br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>...</code>

This stylesheet doesn't just include the code for the button component. It contains the CSS for <em>all</em> of Bootstrap's components. But you're not using any of the other Bootstrap components. So your page is downloading a bunch of CSS that it doesn't need. This extra CSS is a problem for the following reasons:
The extra code slows down your page load. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css/">Render-Blocking CSS</a>.
If a user accesses the page on a mobile device, the extra code uses up their cellular data.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Inspect network activity</span></h2>
This is a hands-on tutorial of some of the most commonly-used DevTools features related to inspecting a page's network activity.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/">Network Reference</a> if you'd like to browse features instead.

Read on, or watch the video version of this tutorial:

<h2>When to use the Network panel</h2>

In general, use the Network panel when you need to make sure that resources are being downloaded or uploaded as expected. The most common use cases for the Network panel are:
Making sure that resources are actually being uploaded or downloaded at all.
Inspecting the properties of an individual resource, such as its HTTP headers, content, size, and so on.

If you're looking for ways to improve page load performance, <em>don't</em> start with the Network panel. There are many types of load performance issues that aren't related to network activity. Start with the Audits panel because it gives you targeted suggestions on how to improve your page. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/speed/get-started/">Optimize Website Speed</a>.
<h2>Open the Network panel</h2>
To get the most out of this tutorial, open up the demo and try out the features on the demo page.

Open the <a href="https://devtools.glitch.me/network/getstarted.html">Get Started Demo</a>.

<strong>Figure 5</strong>. DevTools docked to the bottom of the window

Right now the Network panel is empty. That's because DevTools only logs network activity while it's open and no network activity has occurred since you opened DevTools.
<h2>Log network activity</h2>
To view the network activity that a page causes:

Reload the page. The Network panel logs all network activity in the <strong>Network Log</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/Q4AZ84qTJLEnfToJYVLR.png">
<strong>Figure 6</strong>. The Network Log

Each row of the <strong>Network Log</strong> represents a resource. By default the resources are listed chronologically. The top resource is usually the main HTML document. The bottom resource is whatever was requested last.
Each column represents information about a resource. <strong>Figure 6</strong> shows the default columns:
<strong>Status</strong>. The HTTP response code.

<strong>Type</strong>. The resource type.
<strong>Initiator</strong>. What caused a resource to be requested. Clicking a link in the Initiator column takes you to the source code that caused the request.
<strong>Time</strong>. How long the request took.

<strong>Waterfall</strong>. A graphical representation of the different stages of the request. Hover over a Waterfall to see a breakdown.
<strong>Note</strong> The graph above the Network Log is called the Overview. You won't be using it in this tutorial, so you can hide it if you prefer. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference#hide-overview">Hide the Overview pane</a>.
So long as you've got DevTools open, it will record network activity in the Network Log. To demonstrate this, first look at the bottom of the <strong>Network Log</strong> and make a mental note of the last activity.

Now, click the <strong>Get Data</strong> button in the demo.
Look at the bottom of the <strong>Network Log</strong> again. There's a new resource called <code>getstarted.json</code>. Clicking the <strong>Get Data</strong> button caused the page to request this file.

<strong>Figure 7</strong>. A new resource in the Network Log
<h2>Show more information</h2>
The columns of the Network Log are configurable. You can hide columns that you're not using. There are also many columns that are hidden by default which you may find useful.

Right-click the header of the Network Log table and select <strong>Domain</strong>. The domain of each resource is now shown.

<strong>Tip</strong> You can see the full URL of a resource by hovering over its cell in the <strong>Name</strong> column.
<h2>Simulate a slower network connection</h2>
The network connection of the computer that you use to build sites is probably faster than the network connections of the mobile devices of your users. By throttling the page you can get a better idea of how long a page takes to load on a mobile device.

Click the <strong>Throttling</strong> dropdown, which is set to <strong>Online</strong> by default.

<strong>Figure 11</strong>. Empty Cache And Hard Reload
On repeat visits, the browser usually serves some files from its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">cache</a>, which speeds up the page load. <strong>Empty Cache And Hard Reload</strong> forces the browser to go the network for all resources. This is helpful when you want to see how a first-time visitor experiences a page load.

<strong>Note</strong> The <strong>Empty Cache And Hard Reload</strong> workflow is only available when DevTools is open.
<h2>Capture screenshots</h2>

<strong>Figure 28</strong>. Viewing the initiators and dependencies of a request
When the Requests table is ordered chronologically, the first green request above the request that you're hovering over is the initiator of the dependency. If there's another green request above that, that higher request is the initiator of the initiator. And so on.

<h3>&emsp;View load events</h3>
DevTools displays the timing of the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> and <code>load</code> events in multiple places on the Network panel. The <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event is colored blue, and the <code>load</code> event is red.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Find and fix problems with the Issues tab</span></h2>

The <strong>Issues</strong> tab in Chrome DevTools reduces the notification fatigue and clutter of the Console. Use it to find solutions to problems detected by the browser, such as cookie issues and mixed content.
In Chrome 84, the Issues tab supports three types of issue:
<a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained">Cookie problems</a>

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content">Mixed content</a>
<a href="https://web.dev/coop-coep/">COEP issues</a>
Future versions of Chrome will support more issue types.

<h2>Open the Issues tab</h2>
Visit a page with issues to fix, such as <a href="https://samesite-sandbox.glitch.me/">samesite-sandbox.glitch.me</a>.
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/">Open DevTools</a>.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Simulate mobile devices with Device Mode</span></h2>
Use Device Mode to approximate how your page looks and performs on a mobile device.

Device Mode is the name for the loose collection of features in Chrome DevTools that help you simulate mobile devices. These features include:
<a href="#viewport">Simulating a mobile viewport</a>
<a href="#network">Throttling the network</a>

<a href="#cpu">Throttling the CPU</a>
<a href="#geolocation">Simulating geolocation</a>
<a href="#orientation">Setting orientation</a>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
Think of Device Mode as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_approximation#First-order">first-order approximation</a> of how your page looks and feels on a mobile device. With Device Mode you don't actually run your code on a mobile device. You simulate the mobile user experience from your laptop or desktop.
There are some aspects of mobile devices that DevTools will never be able to simulate. For example, the architecture of mobile CPUs is very different than the architecture of laptop or desktop CPUs. When in doubt, your best bet is to actually run your page on a mobile device. Use <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/">Remote Debugging</a> to view, change, debug, and profile a page's code from your laptop or desktop while it actually runs on a mobile device.

<h2>Simulate a mobile viewport</h2>

For example, a weather website might show the local forecast for a user's area, once the user has granted the website permission to access their location.
If you're building a UI that changes depending on where the user is located, you probably want to make sure that the site behaves correctly in different places around the world. To override your geolocation in Chrome DevTools:

<h2>Step 1: Reproduce the bug</h2>
Finding a series of actions that consistently reproduces a bug is always the first step to debugging.
Click <strong>Open Demo</strong>. The demo opens in a new tab.

<a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/debug-js/get-started" target="_blank">Open Demo</a>
Enter <code>5</code> in the <strong>Number 1</strong> text box.
Enter <code>1</code> in the <strong>Number 2</strong> text box.

Click <strong>Add Number 1 and Number 2</strong>. The label below the button says <code>5 + 1 = 51</code>. The result should be <code>6</code>. This is the bug you're going to fix.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dCZqJCgs1FHWJAeJ1Nub.png">
<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The result of 5 + 1 is 51. It should be 6.

<h2>Step 2: Get familiar with the Sources panel UI</h2>
DevTools provides a lot of different tools for different tasks, such as changing CSS, profiling page load performance, and monitoring network requests. The <strong>Sources</strong> panel is where you debug JavaScript.
Open DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows, Linux). This shortcut opens the <strong>Console</strong> panel.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/JS6A41j5zLtT1J0xqjqL.png">

The <strong>Sources</strong> panel UI has 3 parts:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/fgJB1mwfZsJ7Pv21hzSt.png">
<strong>Figure 4</strong>. The 3 parts of the <strong>Sources</strong> panel UI
The <strong>File Navigator</strong> pane. Every file that the page requests is listed here.

The <strong>Code Editor</strong> pane. After selecting a file in the <strong>File Navigator</strong> pane, the contents of that file are displayed here.
The <strong>JavaScript Debugging</strong> pane. Various tools for inspecting the page's JavaScript. If your DevTools window is wide, this pane is displayed to the right of the <strong>Code Editor</strong> pane.
<h2>Step 3: Pause the code with a breakpoint</h2>

A common method for debugging a problem like this is to insert a lot of <code>console.log()</code> statements into the code, in order to inspect values as the script executes. For example:
<code><span>function</span> <span>updateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> addend1 <span>=</span> <span>getNumber1</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'addend1:'</span><span>,</span> addend1<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> addend2 <span>=</span> <span>getNumber2</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'addend2:'</span><span>,</span> addend2<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> sum <span>=</span> addend1 <span>+</span> addend2<span>;</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'sum:'</span><span>,</span> sum<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  label<span>.</span>textContent <span>=</span> addend1 <span>+</span> <span>' + '</span> <span>+</span> addend2 <span>+</span> <span>' = '</span> <span>+</span> sum<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>
The <code>console.log()</code> method may get the job done, but <strong>breakpoints</strong> can get it done faster. A breakpoint lets you pause your code in the middle of its execution, and examine all values at that moment in time. Breakpoints have a few advantages over the <code>console.log()</code> method:

With <code>console.log()</code>, you need to manually open the source code, find the relevant code, insert the <code>console.log()</code> statements, and then reload the page in order to see the messages in the Console. With breakpoints, you can pause on the relevant code without even knowing how the code is structured.
In your <code>console.log()</code> statements you need to explicitly specify each value that you want to inspect. With breakpoints, DevTools shows you the values of all variables at that moment in time. Sometimes there are variables affecting your code that you're not even aware of.
In short, breakpoints can help you find and fix bugs faster than the <code>console.log()</code> method.

If you take a step back and think about how the app works, you can make an educated guess that the incorrect sum (<code>5 + 1 = 51</code>) gets computed in the <code>click</code> event listener that's associated to the <strong>Add Number 1 and Number 2</strong> button. Therefore, you probably want to pause the code around the time that the <code>click</code> listener executes. <strong>Event Listener Breakpoints</strong> let you do exactly that:
In the <strong>JavaScript Debugging</strong> pane, click <strong>Event Listener Breakpoints</strong> to expand the section. DevTools reveals a list of expandable event categories, such as <strong>Animation</strong> and <strong>Clipboard</strong>.
Next to the <strong>Mouse</strong> event category, click <strong>Expand</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/aRiQWVlQJQz6Mbv1RMag.png">
. DevTools reveals a list of mouse events, such as <strong>click</strong> and <strong>mousedown</strong>. Each event has a checkbox next to it.
Check the <strong>click</strong> checkbox. DevTools is now set up to automatically pause when <em>any</em> <code>click</code> event listener executes.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/j7toLd0kyGNvBJtMhRHS.png">
<strong>Figure 5</strong>. The <strong>click</strong> checkbox is enabled
Back on the demo, click <strong>Add Number 1 and Number 2</strong> again. DevTools pauses the demo and highlights a line of code in the <strong>Sources</strong> panel. DevTools should be paused on this line of code:

<code><span>function</span> <span>onClick</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></code>
If you're paused on a different line of code, press <strong>Resume Script Execution</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/lk63wTlzwXWuRIdSsKP4.png">

 until you're paused on the correct line.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you paused on a different line, you have a browser extension that registers a <code>click</code> event listener on every page that you visit. You were paused in the extension's <code>click</code> listener. If you use Incognito Mode to <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">browse in private</a>, which disables all extensions, you can see that you pause on the correct line of code every time.
<strong>Event Listener Breakpoints</strong> are just one of many types of breakpoints available in DevTools. It's worth memorizing all the different types, because each type ultimately helps you debug different scenarios as quickly as possible. See Pause Your Code With Breakpoints to learn when and how to use each type.

<h2>Step 4: Step through the code</h2>
One common cause of bugs is when a script executes in the wrong order. Stepping through your code enables you to walk through your code's execution, one line at a time, and figure out exactly where it's executing in a different order than you expected. Try it now:
On the <strong>Sources</strong> panel of DevTools, click <strong>Step into next function call</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/uQ1yacZ8AMGI0EFMxT05.png">
 to step through the execution of the <code>onClick()</code> function, one line at a time. DevTools highlights the following line of code:
<code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>inputsAreEmpty</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></code>

Click <strong>Step over next function call</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/KMlE5HW4DU3PRgYEHny9.png">
. DevTools executes <code>inputsAreEmpty()</code> without stepping into it. Notice how DevTools skips a few lines of code. This is because <code>inputsAreEmpty()</code> evaluated to false, so the <code>if</code> statement's block of code didn't execute.

That's the basic idea of stepping through code. If you look at the code in <code>get-started.js</code>, you can see that the bug is probably somewhere in the <code>updateLabel()</code> function. Rather than stepping through every line of code, you can use another type of breakpoint to pause the code closer to the probable location of the bug.
<h2>Step 5: Set a line-of-code breakpoint</h2>
Line-of-code breakpoints are the most common type of breakpoint. When you've got a specific line of code that you want to pause on, use a line-of-code breakpoint:

Look at the last line of code in <code>updateLabel()</code>:
<code>label<span>.</span>textContent <span>=</span> addend1 <span>+</span> <span>' + '</span> <span>+</span> addend2 <span>+</span> <span>' = '</span> <span>+</span> sum<span>;</span></code>
To the left of the code you can see the line number of this particular line of code, which is <strong>32</strong>. Click on <strong>32</strong>. DevTools puts a blue icon on top of <strong>32</strong>. This means that there is a line-of-code breakpoint on this line. DevTools now always pauses before this line of code is executed.

Click <strong>Resume script execution</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/lk63wTlzwXWuRIdSsKP4.png">
. The script continues executing until it reaches line 32. On lines 29, 30, and 31, DevTools prints out the values of <code>addend1</code>, <code>addend2</code>, and <code>sum</code> to the right of each line's semi-colon.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/99Omb7ALyJB7MfYpuqXp.png">
<strong>Figure 6</strong>. DevTools pauses on the line-of-code breakpoint on line 32
<h2>Step 6: Check variable values</h2>

The values of <code>addend1</code>, <code>addend2</code>, and <code>sum</code> look suspicious. They're wrapped in quotes, which means that they're strings. This is a good hypothesis for the explaining the cause of the bug. Now it's time to gather more information. DevTools provides a lot of tools for examining variable values.
<h3>&emsp;Method 1: The Scope pane</h3>
When you're paused on a line of code, the <strong>Scope</strong> pane shows you what local and global variables are currently defined, along with the value of each variable. It also shows closure variables, when applicable. Double-click a variable value to edit it. When you're not paused on a line of code, the <strong>Scope</strong> pane is empty.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Tynv55DnsSgtvpd6Iz9z.png">
<strong>Figure 7</strong>. The <strong>Scope</strong> pane
<h3>&emsp;Method 2: Watch Expressions</h3>

The <strong>Watch Expressions</strong> tab lets you monitor the values of variables over time. As the name implies, Watch Expressions aren't just limited to variables. You can store any valid JavaScript expression in a Watch Expression. Try it now:
Click the <strong>Watch</strong> tab.
Click <strong>Add Expression</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/IYPLvXHyMtjVBILENOIL.png">
.
Type <code>typeof sum</code>.

Press Enter. DevTools shows <code>typeof sum: "string"</code>. The value to the right of the colon is the result of your Watch Expression.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/iAZLQFWjCy2kNbYKPGpR.png">
<strong>Figure 8</strong>. The Watch Expression pane (bottom-right), after creating the <code>typeof sum</code> Watch Expression. If your DevTools window is large, the Watch Expression pane is on the right, above the <strong>Event Listener Breakpoints</strong> pane.

As suspected, <code>sum</code> is being evaluated as a string, when it should be a number. You've now confirmed that this is the cause of the bug.
<h3>&emsp;Method 3: The Console</h3>
In addition to viewing <code>console.log()</code> messages, you can also use the Console to evaluate arbitrary JavaScript statements. In terms of debugging, you can use the Console to test out potential fixes for bugs. Try it now:

If you don't have the Console drawer open, press Escape to open it. It opens at the bottom of your DevTools window.
In the Console, type <code>parseInt(addend1) + parseInt(addend2)</code>. This statement works because you are paused on a line of code where <code>addend1</code> and <code>addend2</code> are in scope.
Press Enter. DevTools evaluates the statement and prints out <code>6</code>, which is the result you expect the demo to produce.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Z5dF1m9vAWBnpMG29Ltv.png">
<strong>Figure 9</strong>. The Console drawer, after evaluating <code>parseInt(addend1) + parseInt(addend2)</code>.
<h2>Step 7: Apply a fix</h2>

You've found a fix for the bug. All that's left is to try out your fix by editing the code and re-running the demo. You don't need to leave DevTools to apply the fix. You can edit JavaScript code directly within the DevTools UI. Try it now:
Click <strong>Resume script execution</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/lk63wTlzwXWuRIdSsKP4.png">

.
In the <strong>Code Editor</strong>, replace line 31, <code>var sum = addend1 + addend2</code>, with <code>var sum = parseInt(addend1) + parseInt(addend2)</code>.
Press Command+S (Mac) or Control+S (Windows, Linux) to save your change.

Click <strong>Deactivate breakpoints</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/WTW7ZmEWJsBaeMrmXRJn.png">
. It changes blue to indicate that it's active. While this is set, DevTools ignores any breakpoints you've set.

Try out the demo with different values. The demo now calculates correctly.
<span>Caution</span>
<strong>Caution:</strong> This workflow only applies a fix to the code that is running in your browser. It won't fix the code for all users that visit your page. To do that, you need to fix the code that's on your servers.

<h2>Next steps</h2>
Congratulations! You now know how to make the most of Chrome DevTools when debugging JavaScript. The tools and methods you learned in this tutorial can save you countless hours.
This tutorial only showed you two ways to set breakpoints. DevTools offers many other ways, including:

Conditional breakpoints that are only triggered when the condition that you provide is true.
Breakpoints on caught or uncaught exceptions.
XHR breakpoints that are triggered when the requested URL matches a substring that you provide.

See Pause Your Code With Breakpoints to learn when and how to use each type.
There's a couple of code stepping controls that weren't explained in this tutorial. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/reference#stepping">Step over line of code</a> to learn more.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Pause your code with breakpoints</span></h2>
Use breakpoints to pause your JavaScript code. This guide explains each type of breakpoint that's available in DevTools, as well as when to use and how to set each type. For a hands-on tutorial of the debugging process, see Debugging JavaScript.
<h2>Overview of when to use each breakpoint type</h2>

The most well-known type of breakpoint is line-of-code. But line-of-code breakpoints can be inefficient to set, especially if you don't know exactly where to look, or if you are working with a large codebase. You can save yourself time when debugging by knowing how and when to use the other types of breakpoints.

</tbody></table>
<h2>Line-of-code breakpoints</h2>

Use a line-of-code breakpoint when you know the exact region of code that you need to investigate. DevTools <em>always</em> pauses before this line of code is executed.
To set a line-of-code breakpoint in DevTools:
Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.

Open the file containing the line of code you want to break on.
Go the line of code.
To the left of the line of code is the line number column. Click on it. A blue icon appears on top of the line number column.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/0BqKJaEX3Afeq6s5GbA6.png">
<strong>Figure 1</strong>: A line-of-code breakpoint set on line <strong>29</strong>
<h3>&emsp;Line-of-code breakpoints in your code</h3>

Call <code>debugger</code> from your code to pause on that line. This is equivalent to a <a href="#loc">line-of-code breakpoint</a>, except that the breakpoint is set in your code, not in the DevTools UI.
<code>console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'a'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'b'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>debugger</span><span>;</span><br>console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
<h3>&emsp;Conditional line-of-code breakpoints</h3>

Use a conditional line-of-code breakpoint when you know the exact region of code that you need to investigate, but you want to pause only when some other condition is true.
To set a conditional line-of-code breakpoint:
Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.

Open the file containing the line of code you want to break on.
Go the line of code.
To the left of the line of code is the line number column. Right-click it.

Select <strong>Add conditional breakpoint</strong>. A dialog displays underneath the line of code.
Enter your condition in the dialog.
Press Enter to activate the breakpoint. An orange icon appears on top of the line number column.

<h3>&emsp;Manage line-of-code breakpoints</h3>

Use the <strong>Breakpoints</strong> pane to disable or remove line-of-code breakpoints from a single location.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dgJMnIWMWFIwtJ76X9w0.png">
<strong>Figure 3</strong>: The <strong>Breakpoints</strong> pane showing two line-of-code breakpoints: one on line 15 of <code>get-started.js</code>, another on line 32

Check the checkbox next to an entry to disable that breakpoint.
Right-click an entry to remove that breakpoint.
Right-click anywhere in the <strong>Breakpoints</strong> pane to deactivate all breakpoints, disable all breakpoints, or remove all breakpoints. Disabling all breakpoints is equivalent to unchecking each one. Deactivating all breakpoints instructs DevTools to ignore all line-of-code breakpoints, but to also maintain preserve their enabled state so that they are in the same state as before when you reactivate them.

<strong>Figure 4</strong>: Deactivated breakpoints in the <strong>Breakpoints</strong> pane are disabled and transparent
<h2>DOM change breakpoints</h2>

Use a DOM change breakpoint when you want to pause on the code that changes a DOM node or its children.
To set a DOM change breakpoint:
Click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.

Go the element that you want to set the breakpoint on.
Right-click the element.
Hover over <strong>Break on</strong> then select <strong>Subtree modifications</strong>, <strong>Attribute modifications</strong>, or <strong>Node removal</strong>.

<strong>Figure 5</strong>: The context menu for creating a DOM change breakpoint
<h3>&emsp;Types of DOM change breakpoints</h3>

<strong>Subtree modifications</strong>. Triggered when a child of the currently-selected node is removed or added, or the contents of a child are changed. Not triggered on child node attribute changes, or on any changes to the currently-selected node.
<strong>Attributes modifications</strong>: Triggered when an attribute is added or removed on the currently-selected node, or when an attribute value changes.
<strong>Node Removal</strong>: Triggered when the currently-selected node is removed.

<h2>XHR/Fetch breakpoints</h2>
Use an XHR breakpoint when you want to break when the request URL of an XHR contains a specified string. DevTools pauses on the line of code where the XHR calls <code>send()</code>.
<strong>Note:</strong> This feature also works with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a> requests.

One example of when this is helpful is when you see that your page is requesting an incorrect URL, and you want to quickly find the AJAX or Fetch source code that is causing the incorrect request.
To set an XHR breakpoint:
Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.

Expand the <strong>XHR Breakpoints</strong> pane.
Click <strong>Add breakpoint</strong>.
Enter the string which you want to break on. DevTools pauses when this string is present anywhere in an XHR's request URL.

Press Enter to confirm.

<h2>Event listener breakpoints</h2>
Use event listener breakpoints when you want to pause on the event listener code that runs after an event is fired. You can select specific events, such as <code>click</code>, or categories of events, such as all mouse events.
Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.

Expand the <strong>Event Listener Breakpoints</strong> pane. DevTools shows a list of event categories, such as <strong>Animation</strong>.
Check one of these categories to pause whenever any event from that category is fired, or expand the category and check a specific event.

<h2>Exception breakpoints</h2>
Use exception breakpoints when you want to pause on the line of code that's throwing a caught or uncaught exception.

Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.
Click <strong>Pause on exceptions</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/Ko2qtw41xR12rOnCfQzt.png">

<strong>Figure 9</strong>: Paused on an uncaught exception

<h2>Function breakpoints</h2>
Call <code>debug(functionName)</code>, where <code>functionName</code> is the function you want to debug, when you want to pause whenever a specific function is called. You can insert <code>debug()</code> into your code (like a <code>console.log()</code> statement) or call it from the DevTools Console. <code>debug()</code> is equivalent to setting a <a href="#loc">line-of-code breakpoint</a> on the first line of the function.
<code><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>let</span> result <span>=</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span> <span>// DevTools pauses on this line.</span><br><span>return</span> result<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>debug</span><span>(</span>sum<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Pass the function object, not a string.</span><br><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

<h3>&emsp;Make sure the target function is in scope</h3>
DevTools throws a <code>ReferenceError</code> if the function you want to debug is not in scope.
<code><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>function</span> <span>hey</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'hey'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>function</span> <span>yo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'yo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>debug</span><span>(</span>yo<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// This works.</span><br><span>yo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>debug</span><span>(</span>hey<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// This doesn't work. hey() is out of scope.</span></code>

Ensuring the target function is in scope can be tricky if you're calling <code>debug()</code> from the DevTools Console. Here's one strategy:
Set a <a href="#loc">line-of-code breakpoint</a> somewhere where the function is in scope.
Trigger the breakpoint.

Call <code>debug()</code> in the DevTools Console while the code is still paused on your line-of-code breakpoint.

<h2>Pause code with breakpoints</h2>

Set a breakpoint so that you can pause your code in the middle of its execution.
See Pause Your Code With Breakpoints to learn how to set breakpoints.
<h2>Step through code</h2>

Once your code is paused, step through it, one line at a time, investigating control flow and property values along the way.
<h3>&emsp;Step over line of code</h3>
When paused on a line of code containing a function that's not relevant to the problem you're debugging, click <strong>Step over</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Y91zw0txWmdqrTJ49eeK.png">
 to execute the function without stepping into it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Rvty5ws4fZ2lid3XeEue.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 1</strong>. <strong>Step over</strong>, outlined in blue

For example, suppose you're debugging the following code:
<code><span>function</span> <span>updateHeader</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> day <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>getDay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> name <span>=</span> <span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// A</span><br><span>updateName</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// D</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>function</span> <span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> name <span>=</span> app<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> app<span>.</span>last<span>;</span> <span>// B</span><br><span>return</span> name<span>;</span> <span>// C</span><br><span>}</span></code>
You're paused on <code>A</code>. By pressing <strong>Step over</strong>, DevTools executes all the code in the function that you're stepping over, which is <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. DevTools then pauses on <code>D</code>.

<h3>&emsp;Step into line of code</h3>
When paused on a line of code containing a function call that is related to the problem you're debugging, click <strong>Step into</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/htSXjGeDQXrMPRk1PNBC.png">

 to investigate that function further.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dTGivIfR6pShgPSNEpCZ.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 2</strong>. <strong>Step into</strong>, outlined in blue
For example, suppose you're debugging the following code:

<code><span>function</span> <span>updateHeader</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> day <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>getDay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> name <span>=</span> <span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// A</span><br><span>updateName</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>function</span> <span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> name <span>=</span> app<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> app<span>.</span>last<span>;</span> <span>// B</span><br><span>return</span> name<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>
You're paused on <code>A</code>. By pressing <strong>Step into</strong>, DevTools executes this line of code, then pauses on <code>B</code>.
<h3>&emsp;Step out of line of code</h3>

When paused inside of a function that is not related to the problem you're debugging, click <strong>Step out</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/xMCC8ajA54Dt06xvvni7.png">
 to execute the rest of the function's code.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Mf2Jkbcv0dBHWTNTMDMQ.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 3</strong>. <strong>Step out</strong>, outlined in blue
For example, suppose you're debugging the following code:
<code><span>function</span> <span>updateHeader</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> day <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>getDay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> name <span>=</span> <span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>updateName</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// C</span><br><span>}</span><br><span>function</span> <span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> name <span>=</span> app<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> app<span>.</span>last<span>;</span> <span>// A</span><br><span>return</span> name<span>;</span> <span>// B</span><br><span>}</span></code>

You're paused on <code>A</code>. By pressing <strong>Step out</strong>, DevTools executes the rest of the code in <code>getName()</code>, which is just <code>B</code> in this example, and then pauses on <code>C</code>.
<h3>&emsp;Run all code up to a certain line</h3>
When debugging a long function, there may be a lot of code that is not related to the problem you're debugging.

You <em>could</em> step through all the lines, but that can be tedious. You <em>could</em> set a line-of-code breakpoint on the line you're interested in and then press <strong>Resume Script Execution</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/ix91vDLx4PdN9W3x8wOa.png">
, but there's a faster way.

Right-click the line of code that you're interested in, and select <strong>Continue to here</strong>. DevTools runs all of the code up to that point, and then pauses on that line.

<h3>&emsp;Change thread context</h3>
When working with web workers or service workers, click on a context listed in the Threads pane to switch to that context. The blue arrow icon represents which context is currently selected.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/bJO6eqgFRXeXmGmN3jv3.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 8</strong>. The Threads pane, outlined in blue

For example, suppose that you're paused on a breakpoint in both your main script and your service worker script. You want to view the local and global properties for the service worker context, but the Sources panel is showing the main script context. By clicking on the service worker entry in the Threads pane, you'd be able to switch to that context.
<h2>View and edit local, closure, and global properties</h2>
While paused on a line of code, use the Scope pane to view and edit the values of properties and variables in the local, closure, and global scopes.

Double-click a property value to change it.
Non-enumerable properties are greyed out.

<h2>View the current call stack</h2>
While paused on a line of code, use the Call Stack pane to view the call stack that got you to this point.
If you're working with async code, check the <strong>Async</strong> checkbox to enable async call stacks.

Click on an entry to jump to the line of code where that function was called. The blue arrow icon represents which function DevTools is currently highlighting.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/z85EIYxxKzDde3aAEhCP.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 10</strong>. The Call Stack pane, outlined in blue
<strong>Note:</strong> When not paused on a line of code, the Call Stack pane is empty.

<h3>&emsp;Copy stack trace</h3>
Right-click anywhere in the Call Stack pane and select <strong>Copy stack trace</strong> to copy the current call stack to the clipboard.

<h2>Ignore a script or pattern of scripts</h2>
Ignore a script to skip it while debugging. When ignored, a script is obscured in the Call Stack pane, and you never step into the script's functions when you step through your code.
For example, suppose you're stepping through this code:

<code><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>prepare</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  lib<span>.</span><span>doFancyStuff</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// A</span><br><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>
<code>A</code> is a third-party library that you trust. If you're confident that the problem you're debugging is not related to the third-party library, then it makes sense to ignore the script.
<h3>&emsp;Ignore a script from the Editor pane</h3>

<h2>Edit a script</h2>

When fixing a bug, you often want to test out some changes to your JavaScript code. You don't need to make the changes in an external browser and then reload the page. You can edit your script in DevTools.
To edit a script:
Open the file in the Editor pane of the Sources panel.

Make your changes in the Editor pane.
Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Windows, Linux) to save. DevTools patches the entire JS file into Chrome's JavaScript engine.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Run Snippets of JavaScript</span></h2>
If you find yourself running the same code in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/"><strong>Console</strong></a> repeatedly, consider saving the code as a Snippet instead. Snippets are scripts that you author in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/sources/"><strong>Sources</strong> panel</a>. They have access to the page's JavaScript context, and you can run them on any page. Snippets are an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklets</a>. Firefox DevTools has a feature similar to Snippets called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad">Scratchpad</a>.
For example, <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the DevTools homepage on the left and some Snippet source code on the right.

CSS changes take effect immediately, no save needed. For JavaScript changes to take effect, press Command+S (Mac) or Control+S (Windows, Linux). DevTools doesn't re-run a script, so the only JavaScript changes that take effect are those that you make inside of functions. For example, in <strong>Figure 4</strong> note how <code>console.log('A')</code> doesn't run, whereas <code>console.log('B')</code> does. If DevTools re-ran the entire script after making the change, then the text <code>A</code> would have been logged to the <strong>Console</strong>.

DevTools erases your CSS and JavaScript changes when you reload the page. See <a href="#workspace">Set up a Workspace</a> to learn how to save the changes to your file system.
<h2>Create, save, and run Snippets</h2>
Snippets are scripts which you can run on any page. Imagine that you repeatedly type out the following code in the <strong>Console</strong>, in order to insert the jQuery library into a page, so that you can run jQuery commands from the <strong>Console</strong>:

<code><span>let</span> script <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'script'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>script<span>.</span>src <span>=</span> <span>'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js'</span><span>;</span><br>script<span>.</span>crossOrigin <span>=</span> <span>'anonymous'</span><span>;</span><br>script<span>.</span>integrity <span>=</span> <span>'sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4='</span><span>;</span><br>document<span>.</span>head<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>script<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
Instead, you can save this code in a <strong>Snippet</strong> and run it with a couple of button clicks, any time you need it. DevTools saves the <strong>Snippet</strong> to your file system.

See Run Snippets of JavaScript to learn more.
<h2>Debug JavaScript</h2>
Rather than using <code>console.log()</code> to infer where your JavaScript is going wrong, consider using the Chrome DevTools debugging tools, instead. The general idea is to set a breakpoint, which is an intentional stopping place in your code, and then step through your code's execution, one line at a time. As you step through the code, you can view and change the values of all currently-defined properties and variables, run JavaScript in the <strong>Console</strong>, and more.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Debug background services</span></h2>
The <strong>Background Services</strong> section of Chrome DevTools is a collection of tools for the JavaScript APIs that enables your website to send and receive updates even when a user does not have your website open. A background service is functionally similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_process">background process</a>. Chrome DevTools considers each of the following APIs to be a background service:

<a href="#fetch">Background Fetch</a>
<a href="#sync">Background Sync</a>
<a href="#notifications">Notifications</a>

<a href="#push">Push Messages</a>
Chrome DevTools can log background service events for 3 days, even when DevTools is not open. This can help you make sure that events are being sent and received as expected. You can also inspect the details of each event.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Analyze runtime performance</span></h2>
<strong>Note:</strong> See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/speed/get-started/">Optimize Website Speed</a> to learn how make your pages load faster.
Runtime performance is how your page performs when it is running, as opposed to loading. This tutorial teaches you how to use the Chrome DevTools Performance panel to analyze runtime performance. In terms of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail">RAIL</a> model, the skills you learn in this tutorial are useful for analyzing the Response, Animation, and Idle phases of your page.

<span>Caution</span>
<strong>Caution:</strong> This tutorial is based on Chrome 59. If you use another version of Chrome, the UI and features of DevTools may be different. Check <code>chrome://help</code> to see what version of Chrome you're running.
<h2>Get started</h2>

In this tutorial, you open DevTools on a live page and use the Performance panel to find a performance bottleneck on the page.
Open Google Chrome in <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">Incognito Mode</a>. Incognito Mode ensures that Chrome runs in a clean state. For example, if you have a lot of extensions installed, those extensions might create noise in your performance measurements.
Load the following page in your Incognito window. This is the demo that you're going to profile. The page shows a bunch of little blue squares moving up and down.

<code>https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/jank/</code>
Press Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows, Linux) to open DevTools.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/IXp4LurzBB57BgokE7aC.png">

<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The demo on the left, and DevTools on the right
<strong>Note</strong>: For the rest of the screenshots, DevTools is <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/customize/#placement">undocked to a separate window</a> so that you can see its contents better.
<h3>&emsp;Simulate a mobile CPU</h3>

Mobile devices have much less CPU power than desktops and laptops. Whenever you profile a page, use CPU Throttling to simulate how your page performs on mobile devices.
In DevTools, click the <strong>Performance</strong> tab.
Make sure that the <strong>Screenshots</strong> checkbox is enabled.

Click <strong>Capture Settings</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/4LzQVJAubPkguM9kg402.png">
. DevTools reveals settings related to how it captures performance metrics.

For <strong>CPU</strong>, select <strong>2x slowdown</strong>. DevTools throttles your CPU so that it's 2 times slower than usual.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ah6pOJ4pk0HgCcohE5ak.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 2</strong>. CPU throttling, outlined in blue
<strong>Note</strong>: When testing other pages, if you want to ensure that they work well on low-end mobile devices, set CPU Throttling to <strong>20x slowdown</strong>. This demo doesn't work well with 20x slowdown, so it just uses 2x slowdown for instructional purposes.

<h3>&emsp;Set up the demo</h3>
It's hard to create a runtime performance demo that works consistently for all readers of this website. This section lets you customize the demo to ensure that your experience is relatively consistent with the screenshots and descriptions you see in this tutorial, regardless of your particular setup.
Keep clicking <strong>Add 10</strong> until the blue squares move noticeably slower than before. On a high-end machine, it may take about 20 clicks.

Click <strong>Optimize</strong>. The blue squares should move faster and more smoothly.
<strong>Note</strong>: If you don't see a noticeable difference between the optimized and un-optimized versions, try clicking <strong>Subtract 10</strong> a few times and trying again. If you add too many blue squares, you're just going to max out the CPU and you're not going to see a major difference in the results for the two versions.
Click <strong>Un-Optimize</strong>. The blue squares move slower and with more jank again.

<h3>&emsp;Record runtime performance</h3>
When you ran the optimized version of the page, the blue squares move faster. Why is that? Both versions are supposed to move each square the same amount of space in the same amount of time. Take a recording in the Performance panel to learn how to detect the performance bottleneck in the un-optimized version.
In DevTools, click <strong>Record</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/gEStzrqw8NDLLcN1siJB.png">
. DevTools captures performance metrics as the page runs.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/eZtzzkEKshRv8KFYbajF.png">

<strong>Figure 3</strong>: Profiling the page
Wait a few seconds.
Click <strong>Stop</strong>. DevTools stops recording, processes the data, then displays the results on the Performance panel.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/lj5ApwyK5o0YmdcYeHjh.png">
<strong>Figure 4</strong>: The results of the profile
Wow, that's an overwhelming amount of data. Don't worry, it'll all make more sense shortly.

<h2>Analyze the results</h2>
Once you've got a recording of the page's performance, you can measure how poor the page's performance is, and find the cause(s).
<h3>&emsp;Analyze frames per second</h3>

The main metric for measuring the performance of any animation is frames per second (FPS). Users are happy when animations run at 60 FPS.
Look at the <strong>FPS</strong> chart. Whenever you see a red bar above <strong>FPS</strong>, it means that the framerate dropped so low that it's probably harming the user experience. In general, the higher the green bar, the higher the FPS.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/rLbUyQ0Y0p6xIiwy85SK.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 5</strong>: The FPS chart, outlined in blue

Below the <strong>FPS</strong> chart you see the <strong>CPU</strong> chart. The colors in the <strong>CPU</strong> chart correspond to the colors in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab, at the bottom of the Performance panel. The fact that the <strong>CPU</strong> chart is full of color means that the CPU was maxed out during the recording. Whenever you see the CPU maxed out for long periods, it's a cue to find ways to do less work.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/XFtPfdKzTPBXeQC9g9OC.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 6</strong>: The CPU chart and Summary tab, outlined in blue
Hover your mouse over the <strong>FPS</strong>, <strong>CPU</strong>, or <strong>NET</strong> charts. DevTools shows a screenshot of the page at that point in time. Move your mouse left and right to replay the recording. This is called scrubbing, and it's useful for manually analyzing the progression of animations.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/HwxH2YN7r7EbH6X7O9nD.png">
<strong>Figure 7</strong>: Viewing a screenshot of the page around the 2000ms mark of the recording
In the <strong>Frames</strong> section, hover your mouse over one of the green squares. DevTools shows you the FPS for that particular frame. Each frame is probably well below the target of 60 FPS.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/8CgXsm3N7ZoqexM4papz.png">
<strong>Figure 8</strong>: Hovering over a frame
Of course, with this demo, it's pretty obvious that the page is not performing well. But in real scenarios, it may not be so clear, so having all of these tools to make measurements comes in handy.

<h4>
Bonus: Open the FPS meter</h4>
Another handy tool is the FPS meter, which provides real-time estimates for FPS as the page runs.

Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux) to open the Command Menu.
Start typing <code>Rendering</code> in the Command Menu and select <strong>Show Rendering</strong>.
In the <strong>Rendering</strong> tab, enable <strong>FPS Meter</strong>. A new overlay appears in the top-right of your viewport.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/CnzqipAr4ZLTZMhzj9tQ.png">
<strong>Figure 9</strong>: The FPS meter
Disable the <strong>FPS Meter</strong> and press Escape to close the <strong>Rendering</strong> tab. You won't be using it in this tutorial.

<h3>&emsp;Find the bottleneck</h3>
Now that you've measured and verified that the animation is not performing well, the next question to answer is: why?
Note the summary tab. When no events are selected, this tab shows you a breakdown of activity. The page spent most of its time rendering. Since performance is the art of doing less work, your goal is to reduce the amount of time spent doing rendering work.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/icVAEBrsTnHXfg68xO0W.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 10</strong>: The Summary tab, outlined in blue
Expand the <strong>Main</strong> section. DevTools shows you a flame chart of activity on the main thread, over time. The x-axis represents the recording, over time. Each bar represents an event. A wider bar means that event took longer. The y-axis represents the call stack. When you see events stacked on top of each other, it means the upper events caused the lower events.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/SqkREdHdAzgeXavWwMtC.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 11</strong>: The Main section, outlined in blue

There's a lot of data in the recording. Zoom in on a single <strong>Animation Frame Fired</strong> event by clicking, holding, and dragging your mouse over the <strong>Overview</strong>, which is the section that includes the <strong>FPS</strong>, <strong>CPU</strong>, and <strong>NET</strong> charts. The <strong>Main</strong> section and <strong>Summary</strong> tab only display information for the selected portion of the recording.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ZKsCP4UtDA1wxaqGHqi7.png">
<strong>Figure 12</strong>: Zoomed in on a single Animation Frame Fired event

<strong>Note</strong>: Another way to zoom is to focus the <strong>Main</strong> section by clicking its background or selecting an event, and then press the W, A, S, and D keys.
Note the red triangle in the top-right of the <strong>Animation Frame Fired</strong> event. Whenever you see a red triangle, it's a warning that there may be an issue related to this event.
<strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Animation Frame Fired</strong> event occurs whenever a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame"><code>requestAnimationFrame()</code></a> callback is executed.

Click the <strong>Animation Frame Fired</strong> event. The <strong>Summary</strong> tab now shows you information about that event. Note the <strong>reveal</strong> link. Clicking that causes DevTools to highlight the event that initiated the <strong>Animation Frame Fired</strong> event. Also note the <strong>app.js:94</strong> link. Clicking that jumps you to the relevant line in the source code.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/IeZiW7iMHzE1MwxqFPAg.png">
<strong>Figure 13</strong>: More information about the Animation Frame Fired event

<strong>Note</strong>: After selecting an event, use the arrow keys to select the events next to it.
Under the <strong>app.update</strong> event, there's a bunch of purple events. If they were wider, it looks as though each one might have a red triangle on it. Click one of the purple <strong>Layout</strong> events now. DevTools provides more information about the event in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab. Indeed, there's a warning about forced reflows (another word for layout).
In the <strong>Summary</strong> tab, click the <strong>app.js:70</strong> link under <strong>Layout Forced</strong>. DevTools takes you to the line of code that forced the layout.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/q9y3chHXU2LoRUvc62JS.png">
<strong>Figure 13</strong>: The line of code that caused the forced layout
<strong>Note</strong>: The problem with this code is that, in each animation frame, it changes the style for each square, and then queries the position of each square on the page. Because the styles changed, the browser doesn't know if each square's position changed, so it has to re-layout the square in order to compute its position. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid_forced_synchronous_layouts">Avoid forced synchronous layouts</a> to learn more.

Phew! That was a lot to take in, but you now have a solid foundation in the basic workflow for analyzing runtime performance. Good job.
<h3>&emsp;Bonus: Analyze the optimized version</h3>
Using the workflows and tools that you just learned, click <strong>Optimize</strong> on the demo to enable the optimized code, take another performance recording, and then analyze the results. From the improved framerate to the reduction in events in the <strong>Main</strong> section's flame chart, you can see that the optimized version of the app does much less work, resulting in better performance.

<strong>Note:</strong> Even this "optimized" version isn't that great, because it still manipulates the <code>top</code> property of each square. A better approach is to stick to properties that only affect compositing. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count#use_transform_and_opacity_changes_for_animations">Use transform and opacity changes for animations</a> for more information.
<h2>Next steps</h2>
The foundation for understanding performance is the RAIL model. This model teaches you the performance metrics that are most important to your users. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail">Measure Performance With The RAIL Model</a> to learn more.

To get more comfortable with the Performance panel, practice makes perfect. Try profiling your own pages and analyzing the results. If you have any questions about your results, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=google-chrome-devtools">open a Stack Overflow question tagged with <code>google-chrome-devtools</code></a>. Include screenshots or links to reproducible pages, if possible.
To become an expert in runtime performance, you've got to learn how the browser translates HTML, CSS, and JS into pixels on a screen. The best place to start is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering">Rendering Performance Overview</a>. <a href="https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-frame/">The Anatomy Of A Frame</a> dives into even more detail.
Last, there are many ways to improve runtime performance. This tutorial focused on one particular animation bottleneck to give you a focused tour through the Performance panel, but it's only one of many bottlenecks you may encounter.

<h2>Goal of tutorial</h2>

This tutorial teaches you how to use Chrome DevTools to find ways to make your websites load faster.
Read on, or watch the video version of this tutorial:

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
You should have basic web development experience, similar to what's taught in this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-development#syllabus">Introduction to Web Development class</a>.
You don't need to know anything about load performance. You'll learn about it in this tutorial!

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is Tony. Tony is very famous in cat society. He has built a website so that his fans can learn what his favorite foods are. His fans love the site, but Tony keeps hearing complaints that the site loads slowly. Tony has asked you to help him speed the site up.

<h2>Step 1: Audit the site</h2>
Whenever you set out to improve a site's load performance, <strong>always start with an audit</strong>. The audit has 2 important functions:

It creates a <strong>baseline</strong> for you to measure subsequent changes against.
It gives you <strong>actionable tips</strong> on what changes will have the most impact.
<h3>&emsp;Set up</h3>

But first, you need to set up the site so that you can make changes to it later:
Go to <code>chrome://version</code> to check what version of Chrome you're using. This tutorial was made with Chrome 68. If you're using an earlier or later version, some features may look different or not be available. You should be able to complete the tutorial still, just keep in mind that your UI may look different than the screenshots.
<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tony">Open the source code for the site</a>. This tab will be referred to as the <em>editor tab</em>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/h2JSHSXIa8G3kOqRILbk.png">
<strong>Figure 2</strong>. The editor tab
Click <strong>tony</strong>. A menu appears.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/N9c7p2yrUhWgUobkDuVs.png">
<strong>Figure 3</strong>. The menu that appears after clicking <strong>tony</strong>
Click <strong>Remix This</strong>. The name of the project changes from <strong>tony</strong> to some randomly-generated name. You now have your own editable copy of the code. Later on, you'll make changes to this code.

Click <strong>Show Live</strong>. The demo opens in a new tab. This tab will be referred to as the <em>demo tab</em>. It may take a while for the site to load.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/2kZXAZgIbvKrafszL6X3.png">
<strong>Figure 4</strong>. The demo tab

Press Command+Option+J (Mac) Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS). Chrome DevTools opens up alongside the demo.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/QyoSneXNo8Npiy28nJlU.png">
<strong>Figure 5</strong>. DevTools and the demo

For the rest of the screenshots in this tutorial, DevTools will be shown as a separate window. You can do this by pressing Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the Command Menu, typing <code>Undock</code>, and then selecting <strong>Undock into separate window</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/YgPOzT6Re0aIGezSKPZr.png">
<strong>Figure 6</strong>. Undocked DevTools

<h3>&emsp;Establish a baseline</h3>
The baseline is a record of how the site performed before you made any performance improvements.
Click the <strong>Audits</strong> tab. It may be hidden behind the <strong>More Panels</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://developer.chrome.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/3pLUyTJ93xjvm0itZ3Lb.png">
<strong>Figure 7</strong>. The Audits panel

Match your audit configuration settings to those in <strong>Figure 7</strong>. Here's an explanation of the different options:
<strong>Device</strong>. Setting to <strong>Mobile</strong> changes the user agent string and simulates a mobile viewport. Setting to <strong>Desktop</strong> pretty much just disables the <strong>Mobile</strong> changes.
<strong>Audits</strong>. Disabling a category prevents the Audits panel from running those audits, and excludes those audits from your report. You can leave the other categories enabled, if you want to see the types of recommendations they provide. Disabling categories slightly speeds up the auditing process.

<strong>Throttling</strong>. Setting to <strong>Simulated Fast 3G, 4x CPU Slowdown</strong> simulates the typical conditions of browsing on a mobile device. It's called "simulated" because the Audits panel doesn't actually throttle during the auditing process. Instead, it just extrapolates how long the page would take to load under mobile conditions. The <strong>Applied...</strong> setting, on the other hand, actually throttles your CPU and network, with the tradeoff of a longer auditing process.
<strong>Clear Storage</strong>. Enabling this checkbox clears all storage associated with the page before every audit. Leave this setting on if you want to audit how first-time visitors experience your site. Disable this setting when you want the repeat-visit experience.
Click <strong>Run Audits</strong>. After 10 to 30 seconds, the Audits panel shows you a report of the site's performance.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/NgjLST0tdYLxJIyaLMAo.png">
<strong>Figure 8</strong>. The Audits panel's report of the site's performance
<h4>

Handling report errors</h4>
If you ever get an error in your Audits panel report, try running the demo tab from an <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">incognito window</a> with no other tabs open. This ensures that you're running Chrome from a clean state. Chrome Extensions in particular often interfere with the auditing process.

<strong>Figure 9</strong>. A report that errored
<h3>&emsp;Understand your report</h3>
The number at the top of your report is the overall performance score for the site. Later, as you make changes to the code, you should see this number rise. A higher score means better performance.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/V9sAawCdJGzkcYHlGaom.png">
<strong>Figure 10</strong>. The overall performance score
The <strong>Metrics</strong> section provides quantitative measurements of the site's performance. Each metric provides insight into a different aspect of the performance. For example, <strong>First Contentful Paint</strong> tells you when content is first painted to the screen, which is an important milestone in the user's perception of the page load, whereas <strong>Time To Interactive</strong> marks the point at which the page appears ready enough to handle user interactions.

<h2>Step 2: Experiment</h2>

The Opportunities section of your audit report gives you tips on how to improve the page's performance. In this section, you implement the recommended changes to the codebase, auditing the site after each change to measure how it affects site speed.
<h3>&emsp;Enable text compression</h3>
Your report says that enabling text compression is one of the top opportunities for improving the page's performance.

Text compression is when you reduce, or compress, the size of a text file before sending it over the network. Kind of like how you might zip a folder before emailing it to reduce its size.
Before you enable compression, here are a couple of ways you can manually check whether text resources are compressed.
Click the <strong>Network</strong> tab.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/g11RtVWK4hcRDwj4WGJZ.png">
<strong>Figure 19</strong>. The Network panel
Click <strong>Use Large Request Rows</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/156xToAGxtuF9W5EQ3Ag.png">
. The height of the rows in the table of network requests increases.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/a5QbfNJhyb20gc9hS6XL.png">

<strong>Figure 20</strong>. Large rows in the network requests table
If you don't see the <strong>Size</strong> column in the table of network requests, click the table header and then select <strong>Size</strong>.
Each <strong>Size</strong> cell shows two values. The top value is the size of the downloaded resource. The bottom value is the size of the uncompressed resource. If the two values are the same, then the resource is not being compressed when it's sent over the network. For example, in <strong>Figure 20</strong> the top and bottom values for <code>bundle.js</code> are both <code>1.4 MB</code>.

You can also check for compression by inspecting a resource's HTTP headers:
Click <strong>bundle.js</strong>.
Click the <strong>Headers</strong> tab.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/a2tGTXojvtJNXs5jFH8y.png">
<strong>Figure 21</strong>. The Headers tab
Search the <strong>Response Headers</strong> section for a <code>content-encoding</code> header. You shouldn't see one, meaning that <code>bundle.js</code> was not compressed. When a resource <em>is</em> compressed, this header is usually set to <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code>, or <code>br</code>. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding#Directives">Directives</a> for an explanation of these values.

Enough with the explanations. Time to make some changes! Enable text compression by adding a couple of lines of code:
In the editor tab, click <strong>server.js</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/1xABsKdRgfthMK0131pr.png">

<strong>Figure 22</strong>. Editing <code>server.js</code>
Add the following code to <strong>server.js</strong>. Make sure to put <code>app.use(compression())</code> before <code>app.use(express.static('build'))</code>.
... const fs = require('fs'); const compression = require('compression'); app.use(compression()); app.use(express.static('build')); ...

<strong>Note</strong>: Usually, you'd have to install the <code>compression</code> package via something like <code>npm i -S compression</code>, but this has already been done for you.
Wait for Glitch to deploy the new build of the site. The fancy animation that you see next to <strong>Logs</strong> and <strong>Show</strong> means that the site is getting rebuilt and redeployed. The change is ready when you see <strong>Show Live</strong> again.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/mmhq1c5QiB0DtICtZKSN.png">

<strong>Figure 23</strong>. The animation that indicates that the site is getting built
Use the workflows that you learned earlier to manually check that the compression is working:
Go back to the demo tab and reload the page. The <strong>Size</strong> column should now show 2 different values for text resources like <code>bundle.js</code>. In <strong>Figure 24</strong> the top value of <code>261 KB</code> for <code>bundle.js</code> is the size of the file that was sent over the network, and the bottom value of <code>1.4 MB</code> is the uncompressed file size.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/F6WaqKTo3NkxzUrGnt7T.png">
<strong>Figure 24</strong>. The Size column now shows 2 different values for text resources
The <strong>Response Headers</strong> section for <code>bundle.js</code> should now include a <code>content-encoding: gzip</code> header.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/2mALWw5969topkCeKfc9.png">
<strong>Figure 25</strong>. The Response Headers section now contains a <code>content-encoding</code> header
Audit the page again to measure what kind of impact text compression has on the page's load performance:

Click the <strong>Audits</strong> tab.
Click <strong>Perform an audit</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/9GXCdrHJFoccxgwFYFBm.png">

.
Leave the settings the same as before.
Click <strong>Run audit</strong>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/3AAwanwyXAGgYS20JRa9.png">
<strong>Figure 26</strong>. An Audits report after enabling text compression
Woohoo! That looks like progress. Your overall performance score should have increased, meaning that the site is getting faster.

<h4>
Text compression in the real world</h4>
Most servers really do have simple fixes like this for enabling compression! Just do a search on how to configure whatever server you use to compress text.

<h3>&emsp;Resize images</h3>
Your new report says that properly sizing images is another big opportunity.
Resizing images helps speed up load time by reducing the file size of images. If your user is viewing your images on a mobile device screen that's 500-pixels-wide, there's really no point in sending a 1500-pixel-wide image. Ideally, you'd send a 500-pixel-wided image, at most.

In your report, click <strong>Properly size images</strong> to see what images should be resized. It looks like all 4 images are bigger than necessary.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/MQEebrl7WbkRsSQ9Xm4H.png">
<strong>Figure 27</strong>. Details about the <em>Properly size images</em> opportunity

Back in the editor tab, open <code>src/model.js</code>.
Replace <code>const dir = 'big'</code> with <code>const dir = 'small'</code>. This directory contains copies of the same images which have been resized.
Audit the page again to see how this change affects load performance.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ln4bwb1bVEIgnR9pNb32.png">
<strong>Figure 28</strong>. An Audits report after resizing images
Looks like the change only has a minor affect on the overall performance score. However, one thing that the score doesn't show clearly is how much network data you're saving your users. The total size of the old photos was around 5.3 megabytes, whereas now it's only about 0.18 megabytes.

<h4>
Resizing images in the real world</h4>
For a small app, doing a one-off resize like this may be good enough. But for a large app, this obviously isn't scalable. Here are some strategies for managing images in large apps:

Resize images during your build process.
Create multiple sizes of each image during the build process and then use <code>srcset</code> in your code. At runtime, the browser takes care of choosing what size is best for the device it's running on. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/images#relative_sized_images">Relative-sized images</a>.
Use an image CDN that lets you dynamically resize an image when you request it.

At the very least, optimize each image. This can often create huge savings. Optimization is when you run an image through a special program that reduces the size of the image file. See <a href="https://images.guide/">Essential Image Optimization</a> for more tips.
<h3>&emsp;Eliminate render-blocking resources</h3>
Your latest report says that eliminating render-blocking resources is now the biggest opportunity.

A render-blocking resource is an external JavaScript or CSS file that the browser must download, parse, and execute before it can show the page. The goal is to only run the core CSS and JavaScript code that is required to display the page properly.
The first task, then, is to find code that doesn't need to be executed on page load.
Click <strong>Eliminate render-blocking resources</strong> to see the resources that are blocking: <code>lodash.js</code> and <code>jquery.js</code>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/30KsfDd87y7S1Tx7KsdY.png">
<strong>Figure 29</strong>. More information about the <em>Reduce render-blocking resources</em> opportunity
Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the Command Menu, start typing <code>Coverage</code>, and then select <strong>Show Coverage</strong>.

Click <strong>Reload</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/sUKAx2esbJbYN6Ti3K8j.png">

. The Coverage tab provides an overview of how much of the code in <code>bundle.js</code>, <code>jquery.js</code>, and <code>lodash.js</code> is being executed while the page loads. <strong>Figure 32</strong> says that about 76% and 30% of the jQuery and Lodash files aren't used, respectively.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/QmkjKS7ovEnvxmOwdva0.png">
<strong>Figure 32</strong>. The Coverage report

Click the <strong>jquery.js</strong> row. DevTools opens the file in the Sources panel. A line of code was executed if it has a green bar next to it. A red bar means it was not executed, and is definitely not needed on page load.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/xiqQiVD1TIga3vAjhOTp.png">
<strong>Figure 33</strong>. Viewing the jQuery file in the Sources panel

Scroll through the jQuery code a bit. Some of the lines that get "executed" are actually just comments. Running this code through a minifier that strips comments is another way to reduce the size of this file.
In short, when you're working with your own code, the Coverage tab can help you analyze your code, line-by-line, and only ship the code that's needed for page load.
Are the <code>jquery.js</code> and <code>lodash.js</code> files even needed to load the page? The Request Blocking tab can show you what happens when resources aren't available.

Click the <strong>Network</strong> tab.
Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the Command Menu again.
Start typing <code>blocking</code> and then select <strong>Show Request Blocking</strong>.

<strong>Figure 35</strong>. Adding a pattern to block any request to the <code>libs</code> directory
Reload the page. The jQuery and Lodash requests are red, meaning that they were blocked. The page still loads and is interactive, so it looks like these resources aren't needed whatsoever!

Click <strong>Remove all patterns</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/68qlmwDuexzRmvlmENsm.png">

 to delete the <code>/libs/*</code> blocking pattern.
In general, the Request Blocking tab is useful for simulating how your page behaves when any given resource isn't available.
Now, remove the references to these files from the code and audit the page again:

Back in the editor tab, open <code>template.html</code>.
Delete <code>&lt;script src="/libs/lodash.js"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script src="/libs/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.
Wait for the site to re-build and re-deploy.

Audit the page again from the <strong>Audits</strong> panel. Your overall score should have improved again.

<h4>
Optimizing the Critical Rendering Path in the real-world</h4>
The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path">Critical Rendering Path</a> refers to the code that you need to load a page. In general, you can speed up page load by only shipping critical code during the page load, and then lazy-loading everything else.

It's unlikely that you'll find scripts that you can remove outright, but you will often find that many scripts don't need to be requested during the page load, and can instead be requested asynchronously. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript#use_async_or_defer">Using async or defer</a>.
If you're using a framework, check if it has a production mode. This mode may use a feature such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">tree shaking</a> in order to eliminate unnecessary code that is blocking the critical render.
<h3>&emsp;Do less main thread work</h3>

Your latest report shows some minor potential savings in the Opportunities section, but if you look down in the Diagnostics section, it looks like the biggest bottleneck is too much main thread activity.
The main thread is where the browser does most of the work needed to display a page, such as parsing and executing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to use the Performance panel to analyze what work the main thread is doing while the page loads, and find ways to defer or remove unnecessary work.

Click the <strong>Performance</strong> tab.
Click <strong>Capture Settings</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/II9FuwvOLWrZAaaPOKTL.png">

.
Set <strong>Network</strong> to <strong>Slow 3G</strong> and <strong>CPU</strong> to <strong>6x slowdown</strong>. Mobile devices typically have more hardware constraints than laptops or desktops, so these settings let you experience the page load as if you were using a less powerful device.
Click <strong>Reload</strong>

<strong>Figure 38</strong>. The Performance panel's trace of the page load
The trace shows activity chronologically, from left to right. The FPS, CPU, and NET charts at the top give you an overview of frames per second, CPU activity, and network activity. The wall of yellow that you see in <strong>Figure 39</strong> means that the CPU was completely busy with scripting activity. This is a clue that you may be able to speed up page load by doing less JavaScript work.

Click the <strong>User Timing</strong> section to expand it. Based on the fact that there seems to be a bunch of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API">User Timing</a> measures from React, it seems like Tony's app is using the development mode of React. Switching to the production mode of React will probably yield some easy performance wins.

<strong>Figure 40</strong>. The User Timing section
Click <strong>User Timing</strong> again to collapse that section.

Browse the <strong>Main</strong> section. This section shows a chronological log of main thread activity, from left to right. The y-axis (top to bottom) shows why events occurred. For example, in <strong>Figure 41</strong>, the <code>Evaluate Script</code> event caused the <code>(anonymous)</code> function to execute, which caused <code>../rbd/pnpm-volume/...</code> to execute, which caused <code>__webpack__require__</code> to execute, and so on.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/vfnYkoiAVM61wxyXIbXc.png">
<strong>Figure 41</strong>. The Main section

Scroll down to the bottom of the <strong>Main</strong> section. When you use a framework, most of the upper activity is caused by the framework, which is usually out of your control. The activity caused by your app is usually at the bottom. In this app, it seems like a function called <code>App</code> is causing a lot of calls to a <code>mineBitcoin</code> function. It sounds like Tony might be using the devices of his fans to mine cryptocurrency...
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/UmtH1RZihmBQxNcmVtE3.png">
<strong>Figure 42</strong>. Hovering over the <code>mineBitcoin</code> activity

<strong>Note:</strong> Although the calls that your framework makes are usually out of your control, sometimes you may structure your app in a way that causes the framework to run inefficiently. Restructuring your app to use the framework efficiently can be a way to do less main thread work. However, this requires a deep understanding of how your framework works, and what kind of changes you can make in your own code in order to use the framework more efficiently.
Expand the <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> section. This tab breaks down what activities took up the most time. If you don't see anything in the Bottom-Up section, click the label for <strong>Main</strong> section. The Bottom-Up section only shows information for whatever activity, or group of activity, you have currently selected. For example, if you clicked on one of the <code>mineBitcoin</code> activities, the Bottom-Up section is only going to show information for that one activity.

The <strong>Self Time</strong> column shows you how much time was spent directly in each activity. For example, <strong>Figure 43</strong> shows that about 57% of main thread time was spent on the <code>mineBitcoin</code> function.
Time to see whether using production mode and reducing JavaScript activity will speed up the page load. Start with production mode:

In the editor tab, open <code>webpack.config.js</code>.
Change <code>"mode":"development"</code> to <code>"mode":"production"</code>.
Wait for the new build to deploy.

Audit the page again.

Reduce JavaScript activity by removing the call to <code>mineBitcoin</code>:
In the editor tab, open <code>src/App.jsx</code>.
Comment out the call to <code>this.mineBitcoin(1500)</code> in the <code>constructor</code>.

Wait for the new build to deploy.
Audit the page again.

Looks like that last change caused a massive jump in performance!
<strong>Note:</strong> This section provided a rather brief introduction to the Performance panel. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/">Performance Analysis Reference</a> to learn more about how you can use it to analyze page performance.

<h4>
Doing less main thread work in the real world</h4>
In general, the Performance panel is the most common way to understand what activity your site does as it loads, and find ways to remove unnecessary activity.

If you'd prefer an approach that feels more like <code>console.log()</code>, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API">User Timing</a> API lets you arbitrarily mark up certain phases of your app lifecycle, in order to track how long each of those phases takes.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Performance features reference</span></h2>
This page is a comprehensive reference of Chrome DevTools features related to analyzing performance.
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/">Get Started With Analyzing Runtime Performance</a> for a guided tutorial on how to analyze a page's performance using Chrome DevTools.

<h2>Record performance</h2>
<h3>&emsp;Record runtime performance</h3>
Record runtime performance when you want to analyze the performance of a page as it's running, as opposed to loading.

Go to the page that you want to analyze.
Click the <strong>Performance</strong> tab in DevTools.
Click <strong>Record</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Re0KNyMRmkswFBpNYVW3.png">
.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Vkr4jM5q0MAgLIvGyG35.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 1</strong>. <strong>Record</strong>, outlined in blue

Interact with the page. DevTools records all page activity that occurs as a result of your interactions.
Click <strong>Record</strong> again or click <strong>Stop</strong> to stop recording.
<h3>&emsp;Record load performance</h3>

Record load performance when you want to analyze the performance of a page as it's loading, as opposed to running.
Go to the page that you want to analyze.
Open the <strong>Performance</strong> panel of DevTools.

Click <strong>Reload page</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/LLUc63dXLxWMXnoL8kyr.png">
. DevTools records performance metrics while the page reloads and then automatically stops the recording a couple seconds after the load finishes.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/lKfrmjzS0hQHvgk425kL.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 2</strong>. <strong>Reload page</strong>, outlined in blue

See <a href="#view-screenshot">View a screenshot</a> to learn how to interact with screenshots.
<h3>&emsp;Force garbage collection while recording</h3>

While you are recording a page, click <strong>Collect garbage</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/3pKYmus2h5cTtgSeGSDj.png">
 to force garbage collection.

<h3>&emsp;Show recording settings</h3>
Click <strong>Capture settings</strong> 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/AVbUTcyBdsQDHOGJrYtO.png">
 to expose more settings related to how DevTools captures performance recordings.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/oMrzdv4yCX3nNYXXxyiO.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 6</strong>. The <strong>Capture settings</strong> section, outlined in blue

<h3>&emsp;Disable JavaScript samples</h3>
By default, the <strong>Main</strong> section of a recording displays detailed call stacks of JavaScript functions that were called during the recording. To disable these call stacks:
Open the <strong>Capture settings</strong> menu. See <a href="#settings">Show recording settings</a>.

Enable the <strong>Disable JavaScript Samples</strong> checkbox.
Take a recording of the page.
Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the difference between disabling and enabling JavaScript samples. The <strong>Main</strong> section of the recording is much shorter when sampling is disabled, because it omits all of the JavaScript call stacks.

<strong>Figure 8</strong>. An example of a recording when JS samples are enabled
<h3>&emsp;Throttle the network while recording</h3>
To throttle the network while recording:

Open the <strong>Capture settings</strong> menu. See <a href="#settings">Show recording settings</a>.
Set <strong>Network</strong> to the desired level of throttling.
<h3>&emsp;Throttle the CPU while recording</h3>

To throttle the CPU while recording:
Open the <strong>Capture settings</strong> menu. See <a href="#settings">Show recording settings</a>.
Set <strong>CPU</strong> to the desired level of throttling.

Throttling is relative to your computer's capabilities. For example, the <strong>2x slowdown</strong> option makes your CPU operate 2 times slower than its usual ability. DevTools can't truly simulate the CPUs of mobile devices, because the architecture of mobile devices is very different from that of desktops and laptops.
<h3>&emsp;Enable advanced paint instrumentation</h3>
To view detailed paint instrumentation:

Open the <strong>Capture settings</strong> menu. See <a href="#settings">Show recording settings</a>.
Check the <strong>Enable advanced paint instrumentation</strong> checkbox.
To learn how to interact with the paint information, see <a href="#layers">View layers</a> and <a href="#paint-profiler">View paint profiler</a>.

<h2>Analyze a performance recording</h2>
After you <a href="#record-runtime">record runtime performance</a> or <a href="#record-load">record load performance</a>, the <strong>Performance</strong> panel provides a lot of data for analyzing the performance of what just happened.

<h3>&emsp;Select a portion of a recording</h3>
Drag your mouse left or right across the <strong>Overview</strong> to select a portion of a recording. The <strong>Overview</strong> is the section that contains the <strong>FPS</strong>, <strong>CPU</strong>, and <strong>NET</strong> charts.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/CvbTzzqLPqoCfo0vJ8UE.gif">

<strong>Figure 12</strong>. Dragging the mouse across the Overview to zoom
To select a portion using the keyboard:
Click on the background of the <strong>Main</strong> section, or any of the sections next to it, such as <strong>Interactions</strong>, <strong>Network</strong>, or <strong>GPU</strong>. This keyboard workflow only works when one of these sections is in focus.

Use the W, A, S, D keys to zoom in, move left, zoom out, and move right, respectively.
To select a portion using a trackpad:
Hover your mouse over the <strong>Overview</strong> section or the <strong>Details</strong> section. The <strong>Overview</strong> section is the area containing the <strong>FPS</strong>, <strong>CPU</strong>, and <strong>NET</strong> charts. The <strong>Details</strong> section is the area containing the <strong>Main</strong> section, the <strong>Interactions</strong> section, and so on.

Using two fingers, swipe up to zoom out, swipe left to move left, swipe down to zoom in, and swipe right to move right.

<h3>&emsp;View main thread activity</h3>
Use the <strong>Main</strong> section to view activity that occurred on the page's main thread.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/xNyVAPQQVzJ6WAehsum5.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 14</strong>. The <strong>Main</strong> section, outlined in blue
Click on an event to view more information about it in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab. DevTools outlines the selected event in blue.

<strong>Figure 15</strong>. More information about the <code>Me</code> function call event in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab
DevTools represents main thread activity with a flame chart. The x-axis represents the recording over time. The y-axis represents the call stack. The events on top cause the events below it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/9GggXOXYnbx2DVeZ3Fa1.png">

<strong>Figure 16</strong>. A flame chart in the <strong>Main</strong> section
In Figure 16, a <code>click</code> event caused a function call in <code>script_foot_closure.js</code> on line 53. Below <code>Function Call</code> you see that an anonymous function was called. That anonymous function then called <code>Me()</code>, which then called <code>Se()</code>, and so on.
DevTools assigns scripts random colors. In Figure 16, function calls from one script are colored light green. Calls from another script are colored beige. The darker yellow represents scripting activity, and the purple event represents rendering activity. These darker yellow and purple events are consistent across all recordings.

See <a href="#disable-js-samples">Disable JavaScript samples</a> if you want to hide the detailed flame chart of JavaScript calls. When JS samples are disabled, you only see high-level events such as <code>Event (click)</code> and <code>Function Call (script_foot_closure.js:53)</code> from Figure 16.
<h3>&emsp;View activities in a table</h3>
After recording a page, you don't need to rely solely on the <strong>Main</strong> section to analyze activities. DevTools also provides three tabular views for analyzing activities. Each view gives you a different perspective on the activities:

When you want to view the root activities that cause the most work, use <a href="#call-tree">the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab</a>.
When you want to view the activities where the most time was directly spent, use <a href="#bottom-up">the <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab</a>.
When you want to view the activities in the order in which they occurred during the recording, use <a href="#event-log">the <strong>Event Log</strong> tab</a>.

<strong>Note:</strong> The next three sections all refer to the same demo. You can run the demo yourself at <a href="https://activitytabs.glitch.me/">Activity Tabs Demo</a> and see the source at <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/activitytabs?path=index.html">GoogleChrome/devtools-samples/perf/activitytabs.html</a>.
<h4>
Root activities</h4>

Here's an explanation of the <em>root activities</em> concept that's mentioned in the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab, <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab, and <strong>Event Log</strong> sections.
Root activities are those which cause the browser to do some work. For example, when you click a page, the browser fires an <code>Event</code> activity as the root activity. That <code>Event</code> might cause a handler to execute, and so on.
In the <strong>Main</strong> section's flame chart, root activities are at the top of the chart. In the <strong>Call Tree</strong> and <strong>Event Log</strong> tabs, root activities are the top-level items.

See <a href="#call-tree">The Call Tree tab</a> for an example of root activities.
<h4>
The Call Tree tab</h4>

Use the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab to view which <a href="#root-activities">root activities</a> cause the most work.
The <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab only displays activities during the selected portion of the recording. See <a href="#select">Select a portion of a recording</a> to learn how to select portions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/OjSICzOrejsaGYTysG7u.png">

<strong>Figure 17</strong>. The <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab
In Figure 17, the top-level of items in the <strong>Activity</strong> column, such as <code>Event</code>, <code>Paint</code>, and <code>Composite Layers</code> are root activities. The nesting represents the call stack. For example, in Figure 17, <code>Event</code> caused <code>Function Call</code>, which caused <code>button.addEventListener</code>, which caused <code>b</code>, and so on.
<strong>Self Time</strong> represents the time directly spent in that activity. <strong>Total Time</strong> represents the time spent in that activity or any of its children.

Click <strong>Self Time</strong>, <strong>Total Time</strong>, or <strong>Activity</strong> to sort the table by that column.
Use the <strong>Filter</strong> text box to filter events by activity name.
By default the <strong>Grouping</strong> menu is set to <strong>No Grouping</strong>. Use the <strong>Grouping</strong> menu to sort the activity table based on various criteria.

Click <strong>Show Heaviest Stack</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/QGgcONKJoO4kVtKreJY3.png">
 to reveal another table to the right of the <strong>Activity</strong> table. Click on an activity to populate the <strong>Heaviest Stack</strong> table. The <strong>Heaviest Stack</strong> table shows you which children of the selected activity took the longest time to execute.

<h4>
The Bottom-Up tab</h4>
Use the <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab to view which activities directly took up the most time in aggregate.

The <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab only displays activities during the selected portion of the recording. See <a href="#select">Select a portion of a recording</a> to learn how to select portions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/m5ooBRBaQ4MLXmjeLgYR.png">
<strong>Figure 18</strong>. The <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab

In the <strong>Main</strong> section flame chart of Figure 18, you can see that almost practically all of the time was spent executing the three calls to <code>wait()</code>. Accordingly, the top activity in the <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab of Figure 18 is <code>wait</code>. In the flame chart of Figure 18, the yellow below the calls to <code>wait</code> are actually thousands of <code>Minor GC</code> calls. Accordingly, you can see that in the <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> tab, the next most expensive activity is <code>Minor GC</code>.
The <strong>Self Time</strong> column represents the aggregated time spent directly in that activity, across all of its occurrences.
The <strong>Total Time</strong> column represents aggregated time spent in that activity or any of its children.

<h4>
The Event Log tab</h4>
Use the <strong>Event Log</strong> tab to view activities in the order in which they occurred during the recording.

The <strong>Event Log</strong> tab only displays activities during the selected portion of the recording. See <a href="#select">Select a portion of a recording</a> to learn how to select portions.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ErnVsmtVYqnc9awGTY5n.png">
<strong>Figure 19</strong>. The <strong>Event Log</strong> tab

The <strong>Start Time</strong> column represents the point at which that activity started, relative to the start of the recording. For example, the start time of <code>1573.0 ms</code> for the selected item in Figure 19 means that activity started 1573 ms after the recording started.
The <strong>Self Time</strong> column represents the time spent directly in that activity.
The <strong>Total Time</strong> columns represents time spent directly in that activity or in any of its children.

Click <strong>Start Time</strong>, <strong>Self Time</strong>, or <strong>Total Time</strong> to sort the table by that column.
Use the <strong>Filter</strong> text box to filter activities by name.
Use the <strong>Duration</strong> menu to filter out any activities that took less than 1 ms or 15 ms. By default the <strong>Duration</strong> menu is set to <strong>All</strong>, meaning all activities are shown.

Disable the <strong>Loading</strong>, <strong>Scripting</strong>, <strong>Rendering</strong>, or <strong>Painting</strong> checkboxes to filter out all activities from those categories.
<h3>&emsp;View GPU activity</h3>
View GPU activity in the <strong>GPU</strong> section.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/MjviwXOVytHRom3xDsDi.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 21</strong>. The <strong>Raster</strong> section, outlined in blue
<h3>&emsp;View interactions</h3>
Use the <strong>Interactions</strong> section to find and analyze user interactions that happened during the recording.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/RLvocLiAoWSxDrSIM0U8.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 22</strong>. The <strong>Interactions</strong> section, outlined in blue
A red line at the bottom of an interaction represents time spent waiting for the main thread.
Click an interaction to view more information about it in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab.

<h3>&emsp;Analyze frames per second (FPS)</h3>
DevTools provides numerous ways to analyze frames per second:
Use <a href="#fps-chart">the <strong>FPS</strong> chart</a> to get an overview of FPS over the duration of the recording.

Use <a href="#frames">the <strong>Frames</strong> section</a> to view how long a particular frame took.
Use the <strong>FPS meter</strong> for a realtime estimate of FPS as the page runs. See <a href="#fps-meter">View frames per second in realtime with the FPS meter</a>.
<h4>

The FPS chart</h4>
The <strong>FPS</strong> chart provides an overview of the frame rate across the duration of a recording. In general, the higher the green bar, the better the frame rate.
A red bar above the <strong>FPS</strong> chart is a warning that the frame rate dropped so low that it probably harmed the user's experience.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/DRy9iQ4PlKbu568jEQxD.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 20</strong>. The FPS chart, outlined in blue
<h4>
The Frames section</h4>

The <strong>Frames</strong> section tells you exactly how long a particular frame took.
Hover over a frame to view a tooltip with more information about it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/MX9kRvaRf3DqfkZAgoTq.png">

<strong>Figure 21</strong>. Hovering over a frame

<strong>Figure 22</strong>. Viewing a frame in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab
<h3>&emsp;View network requests</h3>
Expand the <strong>Network</strong> section to view a waterfall of network requests that occurred during the recording.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ZkpNSWGs2csexM9Mo7GO.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 23</strong>. The <strong>Network</strong> section, outlined in blue
Requests are color-coded as follows:
HTML: Blue

CSS: Purple
JS: Yellow
Images: Green

Click on a request to view more information about it in the <strong>Summary</strong> tab. For example, in Figure 23 the <strong>Summary</strong> tab is displaying more information about the blue request that's selected in the <strong>Network</strong> section.
A darker-blue square in the top-left of a request means it's a higher-priority request. A lighter-blue square means lower-priority. For example, in Figure 23 the blue, selected request is higher-priority, and the green one above it is lower-priority.
In Figure 24, the request for <code>www.google.com</code> is represented by a line on the left, a bar in the middle with a dark portion and a light portion, and a line on the right. Figure 25 shows the corresponding representation of the same request in the <strong>Timing</strong> tab of the <strong>Network</strong> panel. Here's how these two representations map to each other:

The left line is everything up to the <code>Connection Start</code> group of events, inclusive. In other words, it's everything before <code>Request Sent</code>, exclusive.
The light portion of the bar is <code>Request Sent</code> and <code>Waiting (TTFB)</code>.
The dark portion of the bar is <code>Content Download</code>.

The right line is essentially time spent waiting for the main thread. This is not represented in the <strong>Timing</strong> tab.

<h3>&emsp;View memory metrics</h3>

Enable the <strong>Memory</strong> checkbox to view memory metrics from the last recording.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/RKJIxxwVnBj5ivVjvMtI.svg" width="800"><strong>Figure 26</strong>. The <strong>Memory</strong> checkbox, outlined in blue
DevTools displays a new <strong>Memory</strong> chart, above the <strong>Summary</strong> tab. There's also a new chart below the <strong>NET</strong> chart, called <strong>HEAP</strong>. The <strong>HEAP</strong> chart provides the same information as the <strong>JS Heap</strong> line in the <strong>Memory</strong> chart.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dgmYH2RBKH2M2Ej0gaXO.png">
<strong>Figure 27</strong>. Memory metrics, above the <strong>Summary</strong> tab
The colored lines on the chart map to the colored checkboxes above the chart. Disable a checkbox to hide that category from the chart.

The chart only displays the region of the recording that is currently selected. For example, in Figure 27, the <strong>Memory</strong> chart is only showing memory usage for the start of the recording, up to around the 1000ms mark.
<h3>&emsp;View the duration of a portion of a recording</h3>
When analyzing a section like <strong>Network</strong> or <strong>Main</strong>, sometimes you need a more precise estimate of how long certain events took. Hold Shift, click and hold, and drag left or right to select a portion of the recording. At the bottom of your selection, DevTools shows how long that portion took.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/ywM6ZNwJARqChcDXyR8W.png">

<h2><br><span class="orange">Accessibility features reference</span></h2>
This page is a comprehensive reference of accessibility features in Chrome DevTools. It is intended for web developers who:

Have a basic understanding of DevTools, such as how to open it.
Are familiar with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility">accessibility principles and best practices</a>.
The purpose of this reference is to help you discover all of the tools available in DevTools that can help you examine a page's accessibility.

See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/navigation/">Navigating Chrome DevTools With Assistive Technology</a> if you're looking for help on navigating DevTools with an assistive technology like a screen reader.
<h2>Overview of accessibility features in Chrome DevTools</h2>
This section explains how DevTools fits into your overall accessibility toolkit.

When determining whether a page is accessible, you need to have 2 general questions in mind:
Can I navigate the page with a keyboard or <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-builtin#screen_readers">screen reader</a>?
Are the page's elements properly marked up for screen readers?

In general, DevTools can help you fix errors related to question #2, because these errors are easy to detect in an automated fashion. Question #1 is just as important, but unfortunately DevTools can't help you there. The only way to find errors related to question #1 is to try using a page with a keyboard or screen reader yourself. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review">How To Do An Accessibility Review</a> to learn more.
<h2>Audit a page's accessibility</h2>
In general, use the Audits panel to determine if:

A page is properly marked up for screen readers.
The text elements on a page have sufficient contrast ratios. See also <a href="#contrast">View the contrast ratio of a text element in the Color Picker</a>.
To audit a page:

Go to the URL that you want to audit.
In DevTools, click the <strong>Audits</strong> tab. DevTools shows you various configuration options.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/2O9SByfzzLWTPQAcPlgN.png">

<strong>Figure 1</strong>. Configuring audits
<strong>Note</strong>: The screenshots in this section were taken with version 69 of Chrome. You can check what version you're running at <code>chrome://version</code>. The Audits panel UI looks different in earlier versions of Chrome, but the general workflow is the same.
For <strong>Device</strong>, select <strong>Mobile</strong> if you want to simulate a mobile device. This option changes differently your user agent string and resizes the viewport. If the mobile version of the page displays differently than the desktop version, this option could have a significant effect on the results of your audit.

In the <strong>Audits</strong> section, make sure that <strong>Accessibility</strong> is enabled. Disable the other categories if you want to exclude them from your report. Leave them enabled if you want to discover other ways to improve the quality of your page.
The <strong>Throttling</strong> section lets you throttle the network and CPU, which is useful when analyzing load performance. This option should be irrelevant to your accessibility score, so you can use whatever you prefer.
The <strong>Clear Storage</strong> checkbox lets you clear all storage before loading the page, or preserve storage between page loads. This option is also probably irrelevant to your accessibility score, so you can use whatever you prefer.

Click <strong>Run Audits</strong>. After 10 to 30 seconds, DevTools provides a report. Your report gives you various tips on how to improve the page's accessibility.

<h3>&emsp;See also: aXe extension</h3>
You may prefer to use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd">aXe extension</a> rather than the Audits panel. They generally provide the same information, since aXe is the underlying engine that powers the Audits panel. The aXe extension has a different UI and describes audits slightly differently. One advantage that the aXe extension has over the Audits panel is that it lets you inspect and highlight failing nodes.

<h2>The Accessibility pane</h2>
The Accessibility pane is where you can view the accessibility tree, ARIA attributes, and computed accessibility properties of DOM nodes.

To open the Accessibility pane:
Click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.
In the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, select the element which you want to inspect.

Click the <strong>Accessibility</strong> tab. This tab may be hidden behind the <strong>More Tabs</strong>

<h3>&emsp;View an element's position in the accessibility tree</h3>

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-builtin/the-accessibility-tree">The accessibility tree</a> is a subset of the DOM tree. It only contains elements from the DOM tree that are relevant and useful for displaying the page's contents in a screen reader.
Inspect an element's position in the accessibility tree from <a href="#pane">the Accessibility pane</a>.

<h2>View the contrast ratio of a text element in the Color Picker</h2>
Some people with low vision don't see areas as very bright or very dark. Everything tends to appear at about the same brightness, which makes it hard to distinguish outlines and edges. Contrast ratio measures the difference in brightness between the foreground and background of text. If your text has a low contrast ratio, then these low vision users may literally experience your site as a blank screen.
The Color Picker can help you make sure that your text meets recommended contrast ratio levels:

Click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.
In the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, select the text element that you want to inspect.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/I2op86IuFtozDrACGUYb.png">

<strong>Figure 11</strong>. The <code>color</code> property of the element
Check the <strong>Contrast Ratio</strong> section of the Color Picker. One checkmark means that the element meets the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#contrast-minimum">minimum recommendation</a>. Two checkmarks means that it meets the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#contrast-enhanced">enhanced recommendation</a>.

Click the <strong>Contrast Ratio</strong> section to see more information. A line appears in the visual picker at the top of the Color Picker. If the current color meets recommendations, then anything on the same side of the line also meets recommendations. If the current color does not meet recommendations, then anything on the same side also does not meet recommendations.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Navigate Chrome DevTools with assistive technology</span></h2>

This guide aims to help users who primarily rely on assistive technology like screen readers access and use <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/">Chrome DevTools</a>. Chrome DevTools is a suite of web developer tools built into the Google Chrome browser. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference/">Accessibility Reference</a> if you're looking for DevTools features related to improving the accessibility of a web page.
The accessibility of DevTools is a work-in-progress. Some panels and tabs work better with assistive technology than others. This guide walks you through the panels which are the most accessible and highlights specific issues you may encounter along the way.
<h2>Overview</h2>

Before starting, it helps to have a mental model of how the DevTools UI is structured. DevTools is divided into a series of <em>panels</em> which are organized into an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tablist">ARIA <code>tablist</code></a>. For example:
The <strong>Elements</strong> panel lets you view and change <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/">DOM nodes</a> or <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/">CSS</a>.
The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/"><strong>Console</strong> panel</a> lets you read JavaScript logs and live edit objects.

Within the content area of each panel, there are a number of different tools, often referred to as <em>tabs</em> or <em>panes</em> in the documentation. For instance, the <strong>Elements</strong> panel contains additional tabs to inspect event listeners, the accessibility tree, and much more. The distinction between tabs and panes is somewhat arbitrary. The only reason you'll see one term or the other is to maintain consistency with the rest of the official DevTools documentation.
<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/shortcuts/">DevTools Keyboard Shortcuts reference</a> is a helpful cheatsheet. Be sure to bookmark it and refer back to it as you explore the different panels.

<h2>Open DevTools</h2>
To get started, read through <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/">Open Chrome DevTools</a>. There are a number of ways to open DevTools, either through keyboard shortcuts or menu items.
<h2>Navigate between panels</h2>

<h3>&emsp;Navigate by keyboard</h3>
With DevTools open, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> (Mac) to focus the next panel.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> (Mac) to focus the previous panel.

It's also possible to use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus into a panel's <code>tablist</code> and use the arrow keys to change panels, though it may be faster to use the previously mentioned shortcuts.
<h4>
Known issues</h4>

Some panels, such as the <strong>Console</strong> and <strong>Performance</strong> panels, may move focus into their content area as soon as they are activated. This can make navigating by arrow keys difficult.
The selected panel's name is announced, but only after it has read the focused content in the panel. This can make it very easy to miss.
<h3>&emsp;Navigate by Command Menu</h3>

To focus a specific panel, use the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/command-menu/"><strong>Command Menu</strong></a>:
With DevTools open, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) to open the <strong>Command Menu</strong>. The <strong>Command Menu</strong> is a fuzzy search autocomplete combobox.
Type the name of the panel you'd like to open, then use the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard to navigate to the correct option.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run a command.
For example, to open the <strong>Elements</strong> panel:
Open the <strong>Command Menu</strong>.

Type <kbd>E</kbd> then <kbd>L</kbd>. The <strong>Panel &gt; Show Elements</strong> option is selected.
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the command that opens the panel.
Opening a panel this way directs focus to the contents of the panel itself. In the case of the <strong>Elements</strong> panel, focus moves into the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.

<h2>Elements panel</h2>
<h3>&emsp;Inspect an element on the page</h3>
Navigate to the element you want to inspect using the screen reader's cursor.

Simulate a right-mouse click on the element to open the context menu.
Choose the <strong>Inspect</strong> option. This opens the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/"><strong>Elements</strong> panel</a> and focuses the element in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
The <strong>DOM Tree</strong> is laid out as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tree">ARIA <code>tree</code></a>. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom#keynav">Navigate the <strong>DOM Tree</strong> with a keyboard</a> for an example.

<h3>&emsp;Copy the code for an element in the DOM Tree</h3>
With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, bring up the right-click context menu.
Expand the <strong>Copy</strong> option.

Select <strong>Copy outerHTML</strong>.
<h4>
Known issues</h4>

<strong>Copy outerHTML</strong> often doesn't select the current node but instead selects its parent node. However, the contents of the element should still be in the copied outerHTML.
<h3>&emsp;Modify the attributes of an element in the DOM Tree</h3>
With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it editable.

Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between attribute values. When you hear "space" you are inside of an empty text input and can type a new attribute value.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) to accept the change and hear the entire contents of the element.
<h4>

Known issues</h4>
When you type into the text input you get no feedback. If you make a typo and use the arrow keys to explore your input you also get no feedback. The easiest way to check your work is to accept the change, then listen for the entire element to be announced.
<h3>&emsp;Edit the HTML of an element in the DOM Tree</h3>

With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it editable.
Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between attribute values. When you hear the element's name, for instance, "h2", you are inside of a text input and may change the element's type.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) to accept the change.

For example, typing <code>h3</code> and pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) changes the element's start and end tags to <code>h3</code>.
<h2>Elements panel tabs</h2>
The <strong>Elements</strong> panel contains additional tabs for inspecting things like the CSS applied to an element or its place in the accessibility tree.

With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you hear that the <strong>Styles</strong> pane is selected.
Use the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to explore other available tabs.
The <strong>DOM Tree</strong> turns elements with <code>href</code> attributes into focusable links, so you may need to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> more than once to reach the Styles pane.

<h3>&emsp;Known issues</h3>
The <strong>DOM Breakpoints</strong> and <strong>Properties</strong> tabs are not keyboard accessible.
<h3>&emsp;Styles pane</h3>

In the <strong>Styles</strong> pane you'll find controls for filtering styles, toggling element states (such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active"><code>:active</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus"><code>:focus</code></a>), toggling classes, and adding new classes. There is also a powerful style inspection tool to explore and modify styles currently applied to the element that's in focus in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
The key concept to understand about the <strong>Styles</strong> pane is that it only shows styles for the currently-selected node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>. For example, suppose you're done inspecting the styles of a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> node, and now you want to look at the styles for a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> node. To do that, you first need to select the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>. You might find it faster to use the <a href="#inspect">Inspect</a> workflow to inspect a node that's in the general vicinity of the <code>footer</code> node (such as a link within the footer), which focuses the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, and then use your keyboard to navigate to the exact node that you're interested in.
<h4>

Navigate the Styles pane</h4>
Because all of the style tools connect in one way or another back to the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, it makes sense to become an expert in this tool first.
With focus on the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus inside and explore its contents.

Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the first style becomes active. If you're using a screen reader this first style will be announced as "element.style {}".
Press <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to navigate the list of styles in order of specificity. A screen reader announces each style starting with the name of the CSS file, the line number that the style appears on, and the style name itself. For example: "main.css:233 .card__img {}"
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to inspect a style in more detail. Focus begins on an editable version of the style name.

Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between editable versions of each CSS property and their corresponding values. At the end of each style block is a blank editable text field which you may use to add additional CSS properties.
You may continue to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move through the list of styles, or press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to exit this mode and go back to navigating by arrow keys.
Be sure to read through <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/shortcuts#styles">the Styles pane keyboard reference</a> for additional shortcuts.

<h5>
Known Issues</h5>
If you use the <strong>Filter</strong> editable text field you will no longer be able to navigate the list of styles.

<h4>
Toggle element state</h4>
To toggle an element's state, such as <code>:active</code> or <code>:focus</code>:

Navigate to the <strong>Styles</strong> pane and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the <strong>Toggle Element State</strong> button has focus.
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand the collection of element states. The element states are presented as a group of checkboxes.
Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the first state, <code>:active</code>, has focus.

Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to enable it. If the currently-selected element in the DOM Tree has an <code>:active</code> style, it's now applied.
Continue pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> to explore all of the available states.
<h4>

Add an exiting class</h4>
Adjacent to the <strong>Toggle Element State</strong> button is the <strong>Element Classes</strong> button. Move focus to it by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Focus moves into an edit text field labeled <strong>Add New Class</strong>.
The <strong>Element Classes</strong> button is primarily used for adding existing classes to an element. For example, if your stylesheet contained a helper class named <code>.clearfix</code> you could press <code>.</code> inside of the edit text field to see a suggestion list of classes and use the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to find the <code>.clearfix</code> suggestion. Or type the class name out yourself and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to apply it.

<h4>
Add a new style rule</h4>
Adjacent to the <strong>Element Classes</strong> button is the <strong>New Style Rule</strong> button. Move focus to it by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Focus moves into an editable text field inside of the style inspector. The initial text content of the field is the tag name of the element that is selected in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>. You may type any class name you want into this field and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to assign CSS properties to it.

<h3>&emsp;Computed tab</h3>
With focus on the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/reference#computed"><strong>Computed</strong> tab</a>, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus inside and explore its contents. Within the <strong>Computed</strong> tab there are controls for exploring which CSS properties are actually applied to an element in order of specificity.
<h4>

Explore all computed styles</h4>
Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you reach the collection of computed styles. These are presented as an ARIA <code>tree</code>. Expanding a listbox reveals which CSS selectors are applying the computed style. These selectors are organized by specificity. A screen reader announces the computed value, which CSS selector is currently matching, the filename of the stylesheet that contains the selector, and the line number for the selector.
<h4>

Known issues</h4>
If you use the <strong>Filter</strong> text field you will no longer be able to inspect styles.
<h3>&emsp;Event listeners tab</h3>

From within the <strong>Elements</strong> panel you may inspect the event listeners applied to an element using the <strong>Event Listeners</strong> tab. With focus on the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, press the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to navigate to the <strong>Event Listeners</strong> tab.
<h4>
Explore event listeners</h4>

Event listeners are presented as an ARIA <code>tree</code>. You may use the arrow keys to navigate them. A screen reader announces the name of the DOM object that the event listener is attached to, as well as the file name where the event listener is defined and its line number.
<h3>&emsp;Accessibility pane</h3>
With focus on the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference#pane"><strong>Accessibility</strong> pane</a>, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus inside and explore its contents. Within the <strong>Accessibility</strong> pane there are controls for exploring the accessibility tree, the ARIA attributes applied to an element, and its computed accessibility properties.

<h4>
Accessibility Tree</h4>
The <strong>Accessibility Tree</strong> is presented as an ARIA <code>tree</code> where each <code>treeitem</code> corresponds to an element in the DOM. The tree announces the computed role for the selected node. Generic elements like <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> are announced as "GenericContainer" in the tree. Use the arrow keys to traverse the tree and explore parent-child relationships.

<h4>
Known issues</h4>
The type of ARIA tree used by the <strong>Accessibility</strong> pane may not be properly exposed in Chrome for macOS screen readers like VoiceOver. Subscribe to <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=868480">Chromium issue #868480</a> to be informed about progress on this issue.

The <strong>ARIA Attributes</strong> and <strong>Computed Properties</strong> sections are marked up as ARIA trees, but they do not currently have focus management so they are not keyboard operable.
<h2>Audits panel</h2>
The <strong>Audits</strong> panel let's you run a series of tests against a site to check for common issues related to performance, accessibility, SEO, and a number of other categories.

<h3>&emsp;Configure and run an audit</h3>
When the <strong>Audits</strong> panel is first opened, focus is placed on the <strong>Run Audit</strong> button at the end of the form. By default the form is configured to run audits for every category using mobile emulation on a simulated 3G connection.
Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> or navigate back in Browse mode to change the audit settings.

When you're ready to run the audit, navigate back to the <strong>Run Audit</strong> button and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Focus moves into a modal window with a <strong>Cancel</strong> button which allows you to exit the audit. You may hear a series of earcons as the audit runs and refreshes the page multiple times.
<h4>

Known issues</h4>
The different sections of the configuration form are not currently marked up with a <code>fieldset</code> element. It may be easier to navigate them in Browse mode to figure out which controls are associated with each section.
There is no earcon or live region announcement when the audit is finished running. Generally it takes about 30 seconds, after which you should be able to navigate to the results. Using Browse mode may be the easiest way to reach the results.

<h3>&emsp;Navigate the audit report</h3>
The audit report is organized into sections that correspond with each of the audit categories. The report opens with a list of scores for each category. These scores are also links which can be used to skip to the relevant sections. Within each section are expandable <code>details</code> elements, which contain information relating to passed or failed audits. By default, only failing audits are shown. Each section ends with a final <code>details</code> element which contains all of the passed audits.
To run a new audit, use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to exit the report and look for the <strong>Perform An Audit</strong> button.

If your device is showing up as <strong>Offline</strong>, accept the <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong> permission prompt on your Android device.

<h3>&emsp;Troubleshooting: DevTools is not detecting the Android device</h3>
Make sure that your hardware is set up correctly:
If you're using a USB hub, try connecting your Android device directly to your development machine instead.

Try unplugging the USB cable between your Android device and development machine, and then plugging it back in. Do it while your Android and development machine screens are unlocked.
Make sure that your USB cable works. You should be able to inspect files on your Android device from your development machine.
Make sure that your software is set up correctly:

If your development machine is running Windows, try manually installing the USB drivers for your Android device. See <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html">Install OEM USB Drivers</a>.
Some combinations of Windows and Android devices (especially Samsung) require extra set up. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21925992">Chrome DevTools Devices does not detect device when plugged in</a>.
If you don't see the <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong> prompt on your Android device try:

Disconnecting and then re-connecting the USB cable while DevTools is in focus on your development machine and your Android homescreen is showing. In other words, sometimes the prompt doesn't show up when your Android or development machine screens are locked.
Updating the display settings for your Android device and development machine so that they never go to sleep.
Setting Android's USB mode to PTP. See <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/101933">Galaxy S4 does not show Authorize USB debugging dialog box</a>.

<h2>Step 2: Debug content on your Android device from your development machine</h2>

Open Chrome on your Android device.
In the <strong><code>chrome://inspect/#devices</code></strong>, you see your Android device's model name, followed by its serial number. Below that, you can see the version of Chrome that's running on the device, with the version number in parentheses. Each open Chrome tab gets its own section. You can interact with that tab from this section. If there are any apps using WebView, you see a section for each of those apps, too. In <strong>Figure 5</strong> there are no tabs or WebViews open.

<strong>Figure 4</strong>. A connected remote device
In the <strong>Open tab with url</strong> text box, enter a URL and then click <strong>Open</strong>. The page opens in a new tab on your Android device.
Click <strong>Inspect</strong> next to the URL that you just opened. A new DevTools instance opens. The version of Chrome running on your Android device determines the version of DevTools that opens on your development machine. So, if your Android device is running a very old version of Chrome, the DevTools instance may look very different than what you're used to.

<h3>&emsp;More actions: pause, focus, reload, or close a tab</h3>

<strong>Figure 5</strong>. The menu for pausing, reloading, focusing, or closing a tab
<h3>&emsp;Inspect elements</h3>
Go to the <strong>Elements</strong> panel of your DevTools instance, and hover over an element to highlight it in the viewport of your Android device.

You can also tap an element on your Android device screen to select it in the <strong>Elements</strong> panel. Click <strong>Select Element</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/y9AaD4jeSmPRG4sQSylM.png">
 on your DevTools instance, and then tap the element on your Android device screen. Note that <strong>Select Element</strong> is disabled after the first touch, so you need to re-enable it every time you want to use this feature.

<h3>&emsp;Screencast your Android screen to your development machine</h3>
Click <strong>Toggle Screencast</strong> 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/A5AtRECWSgsdtMZkI6g5.png">

 to view the content of your Android device in your DevTools instance.
You can interact with the screencast in multiple ways:
Clicks are translated into taps, firing proper touch events on the device.

Keystrokes on your computer are sent to the device.
To simulate a pinch gesture, hold Shift while dragging.
To scroll, use your trackpad or mouse wheel, or fling with your mouse pointer.

Some notes on screencasts:
Screencasts only display page content. Transparent portions of the screencast represent device interfaces, such as the Chrome address bar, the Android status bar, or the Android keyboard.
Screencasts negatively affect frame rates. Disable screencasting while measuring scrolls or animations to get a more accurate picture of your page's performance.

If your Android device screen locks, the content of your screencast disappears. Unlock your Android device screen to automatically resume the screencast.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Access local servers</span></h2>

Host a site on a development machine web server, then access the content from an Android device.
With a USB cable and Chrome DevTools, you can run a site from a development machine and then view the site on an Android device.
<h2>Summary</h2>

Port forwarding enables you to view content from your development machine's web server on your Android device.
If your web server is using a custom domain, you can set up your Android device to access the content at that domain with custom domain mapping.
<h2>Set up port forwarding</h2>

Port forwarding enables your Android device to access content that's being hosted on your development machine's web server. Port forwarding works by creating a listening TCP port on your Android device that maps to a TCP port on your development machine. Traffic between the ports travel through the USB connection between your Android device and development machine, so the connection doesn't depend on your network configuration.
To enable port forwarding:
Set up <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/">remote debugging</a> between your development machine and your Android device. When you're finished, you should see your Android device in the list.

Click <strong>Port forwarding</strong> button. <code>localhost:8080</code> is set up by default. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/UAxeJU4l4zujSKNYwEib.png">
Check <strong>Enable port forwarding</strong>. If you want to set up other ports, follow the steps 4 and 5. Otherwise skip to step 6.

In the <strong>Port</strong> textfield on the left, enter the <code>localhost</code> port number from which you want to be able to access the site on your Android device. For example, if you wanted to access the site from <code>localhost:5000</code> you would enter <code>5000</code>.
In the <strong>IP address and port</strong> textfield on the right, enter the IP address or hostname on which your site is running on your development machine's web server, followed by the port number. For example, if your site is running on <code>localhost:7331</code> you would enter <code>localhost:7331</code>.
Click <strong>Done</strong>.

Port forwarding is now set up. You can see a status indicator of the port forward at the top as well as besides the device name.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/3WFLAFQbYWZfih8kJKDC.png">
To view the content, open up Chrome on your Android device and go to the <code>localhost</code> port that you specified in the <strong>Device port</strong> field. For example, if you entered <code>5000</code> in the field, then you would go to <code>localhost:5000</code>.

<h2>Map to custom local domains</h2>
Custom domain mapping enables you to view content on an Android device from a web server on your development machine that is using a custom domain.
For example, suppose that your site uses a third-party JavaScript library that only works on the allow-listed domain <code>chrome.devtools</code>. So, you create an entry in your <code>hosts</code> file on your development machine to map this domain to <code>localhost</code> (i.e. <code>127.0.0.1 chrome.devtools</code>). After setting up custom domain mapping and port forwarding, you'll be able to view the site on your Android device at the URL <code>chrome.devtools</code>.

<h3>&emsp;Set up port forwarding to proxy server</h3>
To map a custom domain you must run a proxy server on your development machine. Examples of proxy servers are <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>, and <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>.
To set up port forwarding to a proxy:

Run the proxy server and note the port that it's using. <strong>Note</strong>: The proxy server and your web server must run on different ports.
Set up <a href="#port-forwarding">port forwarding</a> to your Android device. For the <strong>local address</strong> field, enter <code>localhost:</code> followed by the port that your proxy server is running on. For example, if it's running on port <code>8000</code>, then you would enter <code>localhost:8000</code>. In the <strong>device port</strong> field enter the number that you want your Android device to listen on, such as <code>3333</code>.
<h3>&emsp;Configure proxy settings on your device</h3>

Next, you need to configure your Android device to communicate with the proxy server.
On your Android device go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.
Long-press the name of the network that you are currently connected to. <strong>Note</strong>: Proxy settings apply per network.

Tap <strong>Modify network</strong>.
Tap <strong>Advanced options</strong>. The proxy settings display.
Tap the <strong>Proxy</strong> menu and select <strong>Manual</strong>.

For the <strong>Proxy hostname</strong> field, enter <code>localhost</code>.
For the <strong>Proxy port</strong> field, enter the port number that you entered for <strong>device port</strong> in the previous section.
Tap <strong>Save</strong>.

With these settings, your device forwards all of its requests to the proxy on your development machine. The proxy makes requests on behalf of your device, so requests to your customized local domain are properly resolved.
Now you can access custom domains on your Android device Android just as you would on the development machine.
If your web server is running off of a non-standard port, remember to specify the port when requesting the content from your Android device. For example, if your web server is using the custom domain <code>chrome.devtools</code> on port <code>7331</code>, when you view the site from your Android device you should be using the URL <code>chrome.devtools:7331</code>.

<strong>Tip</strong>: To resume normal browsing, remember to revert the proxy settings on your Android device after you disconnect from the development machine.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Remote debugging WebViews</span></h2>

Debug WebViews in your native Android apps using Chrome Developer Tools.
On Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later, use DevTools to debug WebView content in native Android applications.
<h2>Summary</h2>

Enable WebView debugging in your native Android app; debug WebViews in Chrome DevTools.
Access list of debug-enabled WebViews via <strong>chrome://inspect</strong>.
Debugging WebViews is the same as debugging a web page through <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/">remote debugging</a>.

<h2>Configure WebViews for debugging</h2>
WebView debugging must be enabled from within your application. To enable WebView debugging, call the static method <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(boolean)">setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled</a> on the WebView class.
<code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Build</span><span>.</span>VERSION<span>.</span>SDK_INT <span>&gt;=</span> <span>Build</span><span>.</span>VERSION_CODES<span>.</span>KITKAT<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>WebView</span><span>.</span><span>setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>

This setting applies to all of the application's WebViews.
<strong>Tip</strong>: WebView debugging is <strong>not</strong> affected by the state of the <code>debuggable</code> flag in the application's manifest. If you want to enable WebView debugging only when <code>debuggable</code> is <code>true</code>, test the flag at runtime.

<h2>The Memory inspector</h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/Q7ynuEVSKHlcLoBI8xjZ.jpg">
The <strong>Memory inspector</strong> consists of 3 main areas:

<h3>&emsp;Navigation bar</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/FSDfhwDYEkL2yPwJOWvx.jpg">
The <strong>address input</strong> shows the current byte address in hex format. You can input a new value to jump to a new location in the memory buffer. For example, try type <code>0x00000008</code>.

Memory buffers could be longer than a page. Instead of scrolling through, you can use the <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> button to navigate.
The buttons on the left allow a <strong>forward/backward</strong> navigation.
By default, the buffer is automatically updated on stepping. In the case it's not, the <strong>refresh</strong> button gives you the option to refresh the memory and update its contents.

<h3>&emsp;Memory buffer</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/4dzzRu6TRCB70fmMXjIS.jpg">
From the left, the <strong>address</strong> is displayed in hex format.

The <strong>memory</strong> is also shown in hex format, each byte separated by a space. The currently selected byte is highlighted. You can click on the byte or navigate with keyboard (left, right, up, down).
An <strong>ASCII representation</strong> of the memory is shown on the right side. A highlight shows the corresponding value to the selected bits on the byte. Similar to memory, you can click on the byte or navigate with keyboard (left, right, up, down).
<h3>&emsp;Value inspector</h3>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/icshYGOKAiZp1uy7hOoM.jpg">

<h2><br><span class="orange">Fix memory problems</span></h2>
Learn how to use Chrome and DevTools to find memory issues that affect page performance, including memory leaks, memory bloat, and frequent garbage collections.

<h2>Summary</h2>
Find out how much memory your page is currently using with the Chrome Task Manager.
Visualize memory usage over time with Timeline recordings.

Identify detached DOM trees (a common cause of memory leaks) with Heap Snapshots.
Find out when new memory is being allocated in your JS heap with Allocation Timeline recordings.
<h2>Overview</h2>

In the spirit of the <a href="https://web.dev/rail">RAIL</a> performance model, the focus of your performance efforts should be your users.
Memory issues are important because they are often perceivable by users. Users can perceive memory issues in the following ways:
<strong>A page's performance gets progressively worse over time.</strong> This is possibly a symptom of a memory leak. A memory leak is when a bug in the page causes the page to progressively use more and more memory over time.

<strong>A page's performance is consistently bad.</strong> This is possibly a symptom of memory bloat. Memory bloat is when a page uses more memory than is necessary for optimal page speed.
<strong>A page's performance is delayed or appears to pause frequently.</strong> This is possibly a symptom of frequent garbage collections. Garbage collection is when the browser reclaims memory. The browser decides when this happens. During collections, all script execution is paused. So if the browser is garbage collecting a lot, script execution is going to get paused a lot.
<h3>&emsp;Memory bloat: how much is "too much"?</h3>

A memory leak is easy to define. If a site is progressively using more and more memory, then you've got a leak. But memory bloat is a bit harder to pin down. What qualifies as "using too much memory"?
There are no hard numbers here, because different devices and browsers have different capabilities. The same page that runs smoothly on a high-end smartphone might crash on a low-end smartphone.
The key here is to use the RAIL model and focus on your users. Find out what devices are popular with your users, and then test out your page on those devices. If the experience is consistently bad, the page may be exceeding the memory capabilities of those devices.

<h2>Monitor memory use in realtime with the Chrome Task Manager</h2>
Use the Chrome Task Manager as a starting point to your memory issue investigation. The Task Manager is a realtime monitor that tells you how much memory a page is currently using.
Press Shift+Esc or go to the Chrome main menu and select <strong>More tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Task manager</strong> to open the Task Manager.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/N79qVbngo3RGfyJqVAXs.png">
Right-click on the table header of the Task Manager and enable <strong>JavaScript memory</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/HgelJFumP0cFX1lYZc1V.png">

These two columns tell you different things about how your page is using memory:
The <strong>Memory</strong> column represents native memory. DOM nodes are stored in native memory. If this value is increasing, DOM nodes are getting created.
The <strong>JavaScript Memory</strong> column represents the JS heap. This column contains two values. The value you're interested in is the live number (the number in parentheses). The live number represents how much memory the reachable objects on your page are using. If this number is increasing, either new objects are being created, or the existing objects are growing.

<h2>Visualize memory leaks with Timeline recordings</h2>
You can also use the Timeline panel as another starting point in your investigation. The Timeline panel helps you visualize a page's memory use over time.
Open the <strong>Timeline</strong> panel on DevTools.

Enable the <strong>Memory</strong> checkbox.
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#record-runtime">Make a recording</a>.
Tip: It's a good practice to start and end your recording with a forced garbage collection. Click the <strong>collect garbage</strong> button (

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/Qkf1EfUFRSoRsCEMVHdY.png">
) while recording to force garbage collection.
To demonstrate Timeline memory recordings, consider the code below:

<code><span>var</span> x <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>function</span> <span>grow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10000</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    document<span>.</span>body<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br>  x<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>1000000</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><br>document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'grow'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> grow<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
Every time that the button referenced in the code is pressed, ten thousand <code>div</code> nodes are appended to the document body, and a string of one million <code>x</code> characters is pushed onto the <code>x</code> array. Running this code produces a Timeline recording like the following screenshot:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/pPcZQbQ6EleigzceZoct.png">

First, an explanation of the user interface. The <strong>HEAP</strong> graph in the <strong>Overview</strong> pane (below <strong>NET</strong>) represents the JS heap. Below the <strong>Overview</strong> pane is the <strong>Counter</strong> pane. Here you can see memory usage broken down by JS heap (same as <strong>HEAP</strong> graph in the <strong>Overview</strong> pane), documents, DOM nodes, listeners, and GPU memory. Disabling a checkbox hides it from the graph.
Now, an analysis of the code compared with the screenshot. If you look at the node counter (the green graph) you can see that it matches up cleanly with the code. The node count increases in discrete steps. You can presume that each increase in the node count is a call to <code>grow()</code>. The JS heap graph (the blue graph) is not as straightforward. In keeping with best practices, the first dip is actually a forced garbage collection (achieved by pressing the <strong>collect garbage</strong> button). As the recording progresses you can see that the JS heap size spikes. This is natural and expected: the JavaScript code is creating the DOM nodes on every button click and doing a lot of work when it creates the string of one million characters. The key thing here is the fact that the JS heap ends higher than it began (the "beginning" here being the point after the forced garbage collection). In the real world, if you saw this pattern of increasing JS heap size or node size, it would potentially mean a memory leak.
<h2>Discover detached DOM tree memory leaks with Heap Snapshots</h2>

A DOM node can only be garbage collected when there are no references to it from either the page's DOM tree or JavaScript code. A node is said to be "detached" when it's removed from the DOM tree but some JavaScript still references it. Detached DOM nodes are a common cause of memory leaks. This section teaches you how to use DevTools' heap profilers to identify detached nodes.
Here's a simple example of detached DOM nodes.
<code><span>var</span> detachedTree<span>;</span><br><br><span>function</span> <span>create</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> ul <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'ul'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> li <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'li'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    ul<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>li<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br>  detachedTree <span>=</span> ul<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><br>document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'create'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> create<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>

Clicking the button referenced in the code creates a <code>ul</code> node with ten <code>li</code> children. These nodes are referenced by the code but do not exist in the DOM tree, so they're detached.
Heap snapshots are one way to identify detached nodes. As the name implies, heap snapshots show you how memory is distributed among your page's JS objects and DOM nodes at the point of time of the snapshot.
To create a snapshot, open DevTools and go to the <strong>Profiles</strong> panel, select the <strong>Take Heap Snapshot</strong> radio button, and then press the <strong>Take Snapshot</strong> button.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/cZnWVusrPfoLR9R9edO1.png">
The snapshot may take some time to process and load. Once it's finished, select it from the lefthand panel (named <strong>HEAP SNAPSHOTS</strong>).
Type <code>Detached</code> in the <strong>Class filter</strong> textbox to search for detached DOM trees.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/WXv2Bv8LfZKGQBmgcPbl.png">
Expand the carats to investigate a detached tree.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/j2sPLeVjZ5tgbmVhs9Ri.png">

Nodes highlighted yellow have direct references to them from the JavaScript code. Nodes highlighted red do not have direct references. They are only alive because they are part of the yellow node's tree. In general, you want to focus on the yellow nodes. Fix your code so that the yellow node isn't alive for longer than it needs to be, and you also get rid of the red nodes that are part of the yellow node's tree.
Click on a yellow node to investigate it further. In the <strong>Objects</strong> pane you can see more information about the code that's referencing it. For example, in the screenshot below you can see that the <code>detachedTree</code> variable is referencing the node. To fix this particular memory leak, you would study the code that uses <code>detachedTree</code> and ensure that it removes its reference to the node when it's no longer needed.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/YB6UXZtlZ1eleCZUbUuG.png">

<h2>Identify JS heap memory leaks with Allocation Timelines</h2>
The Allocation Timeline is another tool that can help you track down memory leaks in your JS heap.
To demonstrate the Allocation Timeline consider the following code:

<code><span>var</span> x <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>function</span> <span>grow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  x<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>1000000</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br><br>document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'grow'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> grow<span>)</span><span>;</span></code>
Every time that the button referenced in the code is pushed, a string of one million characters is added to the <code>x</code> array.
To record an Allocation Timeline, open DevTools, go to the <strong>Profiles</strong> panel, select the <strong>Record Allocation Timeline</strong> radio button, press the <strong>Start</strong> button, perform the action that you suspect is causing the memory leak, and then press the <strong>stop recording</strong> button (

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/1bMLuZwggo3QfUYi6Irk.png">
) when you're done.
As you're recording, notice if any blue bars show up on the Allocation Timeline, like in the screenshot below.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/2OEngx5L3tELetdn1JDy.png">
Those blue bars represent new memory allocations. Those new memory allocations are your candidates for memory leaks. You can zoom on a bar to filter the <strong>Constructor</strong> pane to only show objects that were allocated during the specified timeframe.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/j1EwNIGrsYdMX23HkF7I.png">

Expand the object and click on its value to view more details about it in the <strong>Object</strong> pane. For example, in the screenshot below, by viewing the details of the object that was newly allocated, you'd be able to see that it was allocated to the <code>x</code> variable in the <code>Window</code> scope.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/y8Yq6Ma0MVawDaG7dz8b.png">
<h2>Investigate memory allocation by function</h2>

Use the <strong>Record Allocation Profiler</strong> type to view memory allocation by JavaScript function.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/EiRjVwtHv1eh7idYWz37.png">
Select the <strong>Record Allocation Profiler</strong> radio button. If there is a worker on the page, you can select that as the profiling target using the dropdown menu next to the <strong>Start</strong> button.

Press the <strong>Start</strong> button.
Perform the actions on the page which you want to investigate.
Press the <strong>Stop</strong> button when you have finished all of your actions.

DevTools shows you a breakdown of memory allocation by function. The default view is <strong>Heavy (Bottom Up)</strong>, which displays the functions that allocated the most memory at the top.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/bR7LtElQ59hH4L3DTpE4.png">
<h2>Spot frequent garbage collections</h2>

If your page appears to pause frequently, then you may have garbage collection issues.
You can use either the Chrome Task Manager or Timeline memory recordings to spot frequent garbage collections. In the Task Manager, frequently rising and falling <strong>Memory</strong> or <strong>JavaScript Memory</strong> values represent frequent garbage collections. In Timeline recordings, frequently rising and falling JS heap or node count graphs indicate frequent garbage collections.
Once you've identified the problem, you can use an Allocation Timeline recording to find out where memory is being allocated and which functions are causing the allocations.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Memory terminology</span></h2>
This section describes common terms used in memory analysis, and is applicable to a variety of memory profiling tools for different languages.

The terms and notions described here refer to the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots/">Chrome DevTools Heap Profiler</a>. If you have ever worked with either the Java, .NET, or some other memory profiler, then this may be a refresher.
<h2>Object sizes</h2>
Think of memory as a graph with primitive types (like numbers and strings) and objects (associative arrays). It might visually be represented as a graph with a number of interconnected points as follows:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/DJLnkpJzkDTH5Kq1ZL02.png">
An object can hold memory in two ways:
Directly by the object itself.

Implicitly by holding references to other objects, and therefore preventing those objects from being automatically disposed by a garbage collector (<strong>GC</strong> for short).
When working with the Heap Profiler in DevTools (a tool for investigating memory issues found under "Profiles"), you will likely find yourself looking at a few different columns of information. Two that stand out are <strong>Shallow Size</strong> and <strong>Retained Size</strong>, but what do these represent?
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/lh4dEARsXXwAEL30wA5p.png">

<h3>&emsp;Shallow size</h3>
This is the size of memory that is held by the object itself.
Typical JavaScript objects have some memory reserved for their description and for storing immediate values. Usually, only arrays and strings can have a significant shallow size. However, strings and external arrays often have their main storage in renderer memory, exposing only a small wrapper object on the JavaScript heap.

Renderer memory is all memory of the process where an inspected page is rendered: native memory + JS heap memory of the page + JS heap memory of all dedicated workers started by the page. Nevertheless, even a small object can hold a large amount of memory indirectly, by preventing other objects from being disposed of by the automatic garbage collection process.
<h3>&emsp;Retained size</h3>
This is the size of memory that is freed once the object itself is deleted along with its dependent objects that were made unreachable from <strong>GC roots</strong>.

<strong>GC roots</strong> are made up of <em>handles</em> that are created (either local or global) when making a reference from native code to a JavaScript object outside of V8. All such handles can be found within a heap snapshot under <strong>GC roots</strong> &gt; <strong>Handle scope</strong> and <strong>GC roots</strong> &gt; <strong>Global handles</strong>. Describing the handles in this documentation without diving into details of the browser implementation may be confusing. Both GC roots and the handles are not something you need to worry about.
There are lots of internal GC roots most of which are not interesting for the users. From the applications standpoint there are following kinds of roots:
Window global object (in each iframe). There is a distance field in the heap snapshots which is the number of property references on the shortest retaining path from the window.

Document DOM tree consisting of all native DOM nodes reachable by traversing the document. Not all of them may have JS wrappers but if they have the wrappers will be alive while the document is alive.
Sometimes objects may be retained by debugger context and DevTools console (e.g. after console evaluation). Create heap snapshots with clear console and no active breakpoints in the debugger.
The memory graph starts with a root, which may be the <code>window</code> object of the browser or the <code>Global</code> object of a Node.js module. You don't control how this root object is GC'd.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/j931F7akeLF5NYMv5QYT.png">
Whatever is not reachable from the root gets GC.
<strong>Note:</strong> Both the Shallow and Retained size columns represent data in bytes.

<h2>Objects retaining tree</h2>
The heap is a network of interconnected objects. In the mathematical world, this structure is called a <em>graph</em> or memory graph. A graph is constructed from <em>nodes</em> connected by means of <em>edges</em>, both of which are given labels.
<strong>Nodes</strong> (<em>or objects</em>) are labelled using the name of the <em>constructor</em> function that was used to build them.

<strong>Edges</strong> are labelled using the names of <em>properties</em>.
Learn <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots/">how to record a profile using the Heap Profiler</a>. Some of the eye-catching things we can see in the Heap Profiler recording below include distance: the distance from the GC root. If almost all the objects of the same type are at the same distance, and a few are at a bigger distance, that's something worth investigating.

<h2>Dominators</h2>
Dominator objects are comprised of a tree structure because each object has exactly one dominator. A dominator of an object may lack direct references to an object it dominates; that is, the dominator's tree is not a spanning tree of the graph.
In the diagram below:

Node 1 dominates node 2
Node 2 dominates nodes 3, 4 and 6
Node 3 dominates node 5

Node 5 dominates node 8
Node 6 dominates node 7
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/5IkAzbiOC1UqGJHqHBxe.png">

In the example below, node <code>#3</code> is the dominator of <code>#10</code>, but <code>#7</code> also exists in every simple path from GC to <code>#10</code>. Therefore, an object B is a dominator of an object A if B exists in every simple path from the root to the object A.

<h2>V8 specifics</h2>

When profiling memory, it is helpful to understand why heap snapshots look a certain way. This section describes some memory-related topics specifically corresponding to the <strong>V8 JavaScript virtual machine</strong> (V8 VM or VM).
<h3>&emsp;JavaScript object representation</h3>
There are three primitive types:

Numbers (e.g., 3.14159..)
Booleans (true or false)
Strings (e.g., 'Werner Heisenberg')

They cannot reference other values and are always leafs or terminating nodes.
<strong>Numbers</strong> can be stored as either:
an immediate 31-bit integer values called <strong>small integers</strong> (<em>SMIs</em>), or

heap objects, referred to as <strong>heap numbers</strong>. Heap numbers are used for storing values that do not fit into the SMI form, such as <em>doubles</em>, or when a value needs to be <em>boxed</em>, such as setting properties on it.
<strong>Strings</strong> can be stored in either:
the <strong>VM heap</strong>, or

externally in the <strong>renderer's memory</strong>. A <em>wrapper object</em> is created and used for accessing external storage where, for example, script sources and other content that is received from the Web is stored, rather than copied onto the VM heap.
Memory for new JavaScript objects is allocated from a dedicated JavaScript heap (or <strong>VM heap</strong>). These objects are managed by V8's garbage collector and therefore, will stay alive as long as there is at least one strong reference to them.
<strong>Native objects</strong> are everything else which is not in the JavaScript heap. Native object, in contrast to heap object, is not managed by the V8 garbage collector throughout its lifetime, and can only be accessed from JavaScript using its JavaScript wrapper object.

<strong>Cons string</strong> is an object that consists of pairs of strings stored then joined, and is a result of concatenation. The joining of the <em>cons string</em> contents occurs only as needed. An example would be when a substring of a joined string needs to be constructed.
For example, if you concatenate <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, you get a string (a, b) which represents the result of concatenation. If you later concatenated <strong>d</strong> with that result, you get another cons string ((a, b), d).
<strong>Arrays</strong> - An Array is an Object with numeric keys. They are used extensively in the V8 VM for storing large amounts of data. Sets of key-value pairs used like dictionaries are backed up by arrays.

A typical JavaScript object can be one of two array types used for storing:
named properties, and
numeric elements

In cases where there is a very small number of properties, they can be stored internally in the JavaScript object itself.
<strong>Map</strong>-an object that describes the kind of object and its layout. For example, maps are used to describe implicit object hierarchies for <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/v8/v8.wiki/+/60dc23b22b18adc6a8902bd9693e386a3748040a/Design-Elements.md">fast property access</a>.
<h3>&emsp;Object groups</h3>

Each native objects group is made up of objects that hold mutual references to each other. Consider, for example, a DOM subtree where every node has a link to its parent and links to the next child and next sibling, thus forming a connected graph. Note that native objects are not represented in the JavaScript heap—that's why they have zero size. Instead, wrapper objects are created.
Each wrapper object holds a reference to the corresponding native object, for redirecting commands to it. In its own turn, an object group holds wrapper objects. However, this doesn't create an uncollectable cycle, as GC is smart enough to release object groups whose wrappers are no longer referenced. But forgetting to release a single wrapper will hold the whole group and associated wrappers.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Record heap snapshots</span></h2>
Learn how to record heap snapshots with the Chrome DevTools heap profiler and find memory leaks.
The Chrome DevTools heap profiler shows memory distribution by your page's JavaScript objects and related DOM nodes (see also <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/memory-101/#objects_retaining_tree">Objects retaining tree</a>). Use it to take JS heap snapshots, analyze memory graphs, compare snapshots, and find memory leaks.

<h2>Take a snapshot</h2>
On the Profiles panel, choose <strong>Take Heap Snapshot</strong>, then click <strong>Start</strong> or press Cmd + E or Ctrl + E:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/eXy0IF7EI8oiqd7CM8KG.png">

<strong>Snapshots</strong> are initially stored in the renderer process memory. They are transferred to the DevTools on demand, when you click on the snapshot icon to view it.
After the snapshot has been loaded into DevTools and has been parsed, the number below the snapshot title appears and shows the total size of the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/memory-101/#object-sizes">reachable JavaScript objects</a>:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/qTTxQm0RcYd1YJsPRJif.png">

<strong>Note:</strong> Only reachable objects are included in snapshots. Also, taking a snapshot always starts with a garbage collection.
<h2>Clear snapshots</h2>
Remove snapshots (both from DevTools and renderers memory) by pressing the Clear all profiles icon:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/vDLKOGnE1e17pfWZgBBQ.png">
Closing the DevTools window will not delete profiles from the renderers memory. When reopening DevTools, all previously taken snapshots will reappear in the list of snapshots.
<strong>Example:</strong> Try out this example of <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devtools-docs/blob/master/docs/demos/memory/example3.html">scattered objects</a> and profile it using the Heap Profiler. You should see a number of (object) item allocations.

<h2>View snapshots</h2>
View snapshots from different perspectives for different tasks.
<strong>Summary view</strong> shows objects grouped by the constructor name. Use it to hunt down objects (and their memory use) based on type grouped by constructor name. It's particularly helpful for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/#overview">tracking down DOM leaks</a>.

<strong>Comparison view</strong> displays difference between two snapshots. Use it to compare two (or more) memory snapshots of before and after an operation. Inspecting the delta in freed memory and reference count lets you confirm the presence and cause of a memory leak.
<strong>Containment view</strong> allows exploration of heap contents. It provides a better view of object structure, helping analyze objects referenced in the global namespace (window) to find out what is keeping them around. Use it to analyze closures and dive into your objects at a low level.
<strong>Dominators view</strong> shows the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/memory-101/#dominators">dominators tree</a> and can be useful to find accumulation points. This view helps confirm that no unexpected references to objects are still hanging around and that deletion/garbage collection is actually working.

To switch between views, use the selector at the bottom of the view:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/x7nyCuSlwz3gbRhwIvJZ.png">
<strong>Note:</strong> Not all properties are stored on the JavaScript heap. Properties implemented using getters that execute native code aren't captured. Also, non-string values such as numbers are not captured.

<h3>&emsp;Summary view</h3>
Initially, a snapshot opens in the Summary view, displaying object totals, which can be expanded to show instances:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/lpUo7q7jG2S2CVIw65ql.png">

Top-level entries are "total" lines. They display:
<strong>Constructor</strong> represents all objects created using this constructor.
<strong>Number of object instances</strong> is displayed in the # column.

<strong>Shallow size</strong> column displays the sum of shallow sizes of all objects created by a certain constructor function. The shallow size is the size of memory held by an object itself (generally, arrays and strings have larger shallow sizes). See also <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/memory-101/#object-sizes">Object sizes</a>.
<strong>Retained size</strong> column displays the maximum retained size among the same set of objects. The size of memory that can be freed once an object is deleted (and this its dependents made no longer reachable) is called the retained size. See also <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/memory-101/#object-sizes">Object sizes</a>.
<strong>Distance</strong> displays the distance to the root using the shortest simple path of nodes.

After expanding a total line in the upper view, all of its instances are displayed. For each instance, its shallow and retained sizes are displayed in the corresponding columns. The number after the @ character is the objects' unique ID, allowing you to compare heap snapshots on per-object basis.
Remember that yellow objects have JavaScript references on them and red objects are detached nodes which are referenced from one with a yellow background.
<strong>What do the various constructor (group) entries in the Heap profiler correspond to?</strong>

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/nsY5dgLPRJJIOhADyHyR.jpg">
<strong>(global property)</strong>–intermediate objects between a global object (like 'window') and an object referenced by it. If an object is created using a constructor Person and is held by a global object, the retaining path would look like [global] &gt; (global property) &gt; Person. This contrasts with the norm, where objects directly reference each other. We have intermediate objects for performance reasons. Globals are modified regularly and property access optimizations do a good job for non-global objects aren't applicable for globals.
<strong>(roots)</strong>–The root entries in the retaining tree view are the entities that have references to the selected object. These can also be references created by the engine for its own purposes. The engine has caches which reference objects, but all such references are weak and won't prevent an object from being collected given that there are no truly strong references.

<strong>(closure)</strong>–a count of references to a group of objects through function closures
<strong>(array, string, number, regexp)</strong>–a list of object types with properties which reference an Array, String, Number or regular expression.
<strong>(compiled code)</strong>–simply, everything related to compiled code. Script is similar to a function but corresponds to a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> body. SharedFunctionInfos (SFI) are objects standing between functions and compiled code. Functions are usually have a context, while SFIs do not.

<strong>HTMLDivElement</strong>, <strong>HTMLAnchorElement</strong>, <strong>DocumentFragment</strong> etc–references to elements or document objects of a particular type referenced by your code.
<strong>Example:</strong> Try this <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/heap-profiling-summary">demo page</a> to understand how the Summary view can be used.
<h3>&emsp;Comparison view</h3>

Find leaked objects by comparing multiple snapshots to each other. To verify that a certain application operation doesn't create leaks (for example, usually a pair of direct and reverse operations, like opening a document, and then closing it, should not leave any garbage), you may follow the scenario below:
Take a heap snapshot before performing an operation.
Perform an operation (interact with a page in some way that you believe to be causing a leak).

Perform a reverse operation (do the opposite interaction and repeat it a few times).
Take a second heap snapshot and change the view of this one to Comparison, comparing it to snapshot 1.
In the Comparison view, the difference between two snapshots is displayed. When expanding a total entry, added and deleted object instances are shown:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/heap-profiling-comparison">demo page</a> to get an idea how to use snapshot comparison for detecting leaks.
<h3>&emsp;Containment view</h3>
The Containment view is essentially a "bird's eye view" of your application's objects structure. It allows you to peek inside function closures, to observe VM internal objects that together make up your JavaScript objects, and to understand how much memory your application uses at a very low level.

The view provides several entry points:
<strong>DOMWindow objects</strong> are objects considered as "global" objects for JavaScript code.
<strong>GC roots</strong> are the actual GC roots used by VM's garbage. GC roots can be comprised of built-in object maps, symbol tables, VM thread stacks, compilation caches, handle scopes, global handles.

<strong>Native objects</strong> are browser objects "pushed" inside the JavaScript virtual machine to allow automation, for example, DOM nodes, CSS rules.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/heap-profiling-containment">demo page</a> for finding out how to explore closures and event handlers using the view.
<strong>A tip about closures</strong>

It helps a lot to name the functions so you can easily distinguish between closures in the snapshot. For example, this example does not use named functions:
<code><span>function</span> <span>createLargeClosure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> largeStr <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>1000000</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>var</span> <span>lC</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// this is NOT a named function</span><br><span>return</span> largeStr<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>return</span> lC<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>
Whilst this example does:

<code><span>function</span> <span>createLargeClosure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>var</span> largeStr <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>1000000</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>var</span> <span>lC</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>lC</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// this IS a named function</span><br><span>return</span> largeStr<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>return</span> lC<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code>

<h3>&emsp;Dominators view</h3>

The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/memory-101/#dominators">Dominators</a> view shows the dominators tree for the heap graph. It looks similar to the Containment view, but lacks property names. This is because a dominator of an object may lack direct references to it; the dominators tree is not a spanning tree of the graph. But this only serves for good, as helps us to identify memory accumulation points quickly.
<strong>Note:</strong> In Chrome Canary, Dominators view can be enabled by going to Settings &gt; Show advanced heap snapshot properties and restarting the DevTools.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devtools-docs/blob/master/docs/demos/memory/example10.html">retaining paths and dominators</a>.

<h2>Look up color coding</h2>
Properties and property values of objects have different types and are colored accordingly. Each property has one of four types:
<strong>a: property</strong>—regular property with a name, accessed via the . (dot) operator, or via brackets (<code>[]</code>) notation, e.g. <code>[foo bar]</code>

<strong>0: element</strong>—regular property with a numeric index, accessed via brackets (<code>[]</code>) notation
<strong>a: context var</strong> - variable in a function context, accessible by its name from inside a function closure;
<strong>a: system prop</strong> - property added by the JavaScript VM, not accessible from JavaScript code.

Objects designated as <code>System</code>do not have a corresponding JavaScript type. They are part of JavaScript VM's object system implementation. V8 allocates most of its internal objects in the same heap as the user's JS objects. So these are just v8 internals.
<h2>Find a specific object</h2>
To find an object in the collected heap you can search using <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd></kbd> and give the object ID.

<h2>Uncover DOM leaks</h2>
The heap profiler has the ability to reflect bidirectional dependencies between browser native objects (DOM nodes, CSS rules) and JavaScript objects. This helps to discover otherwise invisible leaks happening due to forgotten detached DOM subtrees floating around.
DOM leaks can be bigger than you think. Consider the following sample - when is the #tree GC?

<code>  <span>var</span> select <span>=</span> document<span>.</span>querySelector<span>;</span><br><span>var</span> treeRef <span>=</span> <span>select</span><span>(</span><span>"#tree"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> leafRef <span>=</span> <span>select</span><span>(</span><span>"#leaf"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>var</span> body <span>=</span> <span>select</span><span>(</span><span>"body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><br>  body<span>.</span><span>removeChild</span><span>(</span>treeRef<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>//#tree can't be GC yet due to treeRef</span><br>  treeRef <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>//#tree can't be GC yet due to indirect</span><br><span>//reference from leafRef</span><br><br>  leafRef <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span><br><span>//#NOW can be #tree GC</span></code>
<code>#leaf</code> maintains a reference to it's parent (parentNode) and recursively up to <code>#tree</code>, so only when leafRef is nullified is the WHOLE tree under <code>#tree</code> a candidate for GC.

<h2><br><span class="orange">How to Use the Allocation Profiler Tool</span></h2>
Use the allocation profiler tool to find objects that aren't being properly garbage collected, and continue to retain memory.
<h2>How the tool works</h2>

The <strong>allocation profiler</strong> combines the detailed snapshot information of the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots/">heap profiler</a> with the incremental updating and tracking of the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/">Timeline panel</a>. Similar to these tools, tracking objects' heap allocation involves starting a recording, performing a sequence of actions, then stop the recording for analysis.
The tool takes heap snapshots periodically throughout the recording (as frequently as every 50 ms!) and one final snapshot at the end of the recording.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/eQkiSycjOtiM8pGHNCFH.png">

<strong>Note:</strong> The number after the @ is an object ID that persists among multiple snapshots taken. This allows precise comparison between heap states. Displaying an object's address makes no sense, as objects are moved during garbage collections.
<h2>Enable allocation profiler</h2>
To begin using the allocation profiler:

Make sure you have the latest <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">Chrome Canary</a>.
Open the Developer Tools and click on the gear icon in the lower right.
Now, open the Profiler panel, you should see a profile called "Record Heap Allocations"

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/f5LWyjVhPWDTihZsMBRU.png">
<h2>Read a heap allocation profile</h2>
The heap allocation profile shows where objects are being created and identifies the retaining path. In the snapshot below, the bars at the top indicate when new objects are found in the heap.

The height of each bar corresponds to the size of the recently allocated objects, and the color of the bars indicate whether or not those objects are still live in the final heap snapshot. Blue bars indicate objects that are still live at the end of the timeline, Gray bars indicate objects that were allocated during the timeline, but have since been garbage collected:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/nSsCYXi2rkMk2SBaH9Gj.png">
In the snapshot below, an action was performed 10 times. The sample program caches five objects, so the last five blue bars are expected. But the leftmost blue bar indicates a potential problem.

You can then use the sliders in the timeline above to zoom in on that particular snapshot and see the objects that were recently allocated at that point:
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/6VYMytA90PywfFglF7mu.png">
Clicking on a specific object in the heap will show its retaining tree in the bottom portion of the heap snapshot. Examining the retaining path to the object should give you enough information to understand why the object was not collected, and you can make the necessary code changes to remove the unnecessary reference.

<h2>View memory allocation by function</h2>
You can also view memory allocation by JavaScript function. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/#allocation-profile">Investigate memory allocation by function</a> for more information.

<strong>Add a new recording</strong>. Click on the <strong>+</strong> icon to <a href="#record">add a new recording</a>.

<strong>View all recordings</strong>. The dropdown shows the list of saved recordings. Select the <strong>[number] recording(s)</strong> option to expand and manage the list of saved recordings.

<strong>Export a recording</strong>. You can export the user flow as <a href="https://pptr.dev">Puppeteer</a> script to customize the script further.

<strong>Delete a recording</strong>. Delete the selected recording.
<h2>Edit steps</h2>
Let's walk through the options to edit the steps within a workflow.

Expand each step to see the details of the action. For example, expand the <em>Click Element "Cappucino"</em> step. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/ADbB4FFeiBBZqbxKRw0s.png">
The step above shows 2 <strong>selectors</strong>. The <strong>Recorder</strong> will automatically detect 2 selectors for most of the steps by default.

When replaying the user flow, the <strong>Recorder</strong> will try to query the element with one of the selectors by sequence.
For example, if the <strong>Recorder</strong> successfully queries the element with the first selector, it will skip the second selector and proceed to the next step.
You can add or remove any selectors. For example, you can remove the <em>selector #2</em> because just <code>aria/Cappucino</code> is sufficient in this case. Hover over the <em>selector #2</em> and click on <strong>-</strong> to remove it. 

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/qEat3jT1Og68urhmSkef.png">
The <strong>selector</strong> is editable too. For example, if you want to select <em>Mocha</em> instead of <em>Cappucino</em>, you can edit the selector value to <em>aria/Mocha</em> instead. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/OdihJ4BROOXZ93eidr4b.png">

<a href="#replay">Replay</a> the flow now, it should select <em>Mocha</em> instead of <em>Cappucino</em>.
Try to edit other step properties such as <strong>type</strong>, <strong>target</strong>, <strong>value</strong> and more.
There are options to add and remove steps too. This is useful if you want to add an extra step or remove an accidentally added step. Instead of re-recording the user flow, you can just edit it. Click on the <strong>3-dot</strong> kebab menu next to the step to open the menu.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/rs8gfXvOFh0Jrnw3F15j.png">
For example, the <em>Scroll</em> event after the <em>Mocha</em> step is not necessary. You can select <strong>Remove step</strong> to remove it.
Says, you want to <strong>wait until there are 9 coffees</strong> display on the page before performing any steps.

In the <em>Mocha</em> step menu, select <strong>Add step before</strong>.
A new step is created. 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/jEOHv9iiVfqMQvKRbueR.png">

Edit the step with the following details:
type: <strong>waitForElement</strong>
selector #1: <strong>.cup</strong>

operator: <strong>==</strong> (click <strong>add operator</strong> button)
count: <strong>9</strong> (click <strong>add count</strong> button)

<h2><br><span class="orange">Edit files with Workspaces</span></h2>
<strong>Goal</strong>: This tutorial provides hands-on practice in setting up and using Workspaces so that you can use Workspaces in your own projects. Workspaces enable you to save changes that you make within DevTools to source code that's stored on your computer.

<span>Caution</span>
<strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Before beginning this tutorial, you should know how to:
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web page</a>.

<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/">Use DevTools to make basic changes to CSS</a>.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#Running_a_simple_local_HTTP_server">Run a local HTTP web server</a>.
<h2>Overview</h2>

Workspaces enable you to save a change that you make in Devtools to a local copy of the same file on your computer. For example, suppose:
You have the source code for your site on your desktop.
You're running a local web server from the source code directory, so that the site is accessible at <code>localhost:8080</code>.

You've got <code>localhost:8080</code> open in Google Chrome, and you're using DevTools to change the site's CSS.
With Workspaces enabled, the CSS changes that you make within DevTools are saved to the source code on your desktop.
<h2>Limitations</h2>

If you're using a modern framework, it probably transforms your source code from a format that's easy for you to maintain into a format that's optimized to run as quickly as possible. Workspaces is usually able to map the optimized code back to your original source code with the help of <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps">source maps</a>. But there's a lot of variation between frameworks over how they use source maps. Devtools simply can't support all the variations.
Workspaces is known to not work with these frameworks:
Create React App

If you run into issues while using Workspaces with your framework of choice, or you get it working after some custom configuration, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-chrome-developer-tools">start a thread in the mailing list</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=google-chrome-devtools">ask a question on Stack Overflow</a> to share your knowledge with the rest of the DevTools community.
<h2>Related feature: Local Overrides</h2>
Local Overrides is another DevTools feature that is similar to Workspaces. Use Local Overrides when you want to experiment with changes to a page, and you need to see those changes across page loads, but you don't care about mapping your changes to the page's source code.

<h2>Step 1: Setup</h2>
Complete this tutorial to get hands-on experience with Workspaces.
<h3>&emsp;Set up the demo</h3>

<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/workspaces">Open the demo</a>. In the bottom-left of the editor, click the button labelled <strong>Tools</strong>.
Under <strong>Tools</strong>, select <strong>Import/Export</strong> &gt; <strong>Download Project</strong>.
Close the tab.

Unzip the source code and move the unzipped <code>app</code> directory to your desktop. For the rest of this tutorial this directory will be referred to as <code>~/Desktop/app</code>.
Start a local web server in <code>~/Desktop/app</code>. Below is some sample code for starting up <code>SimpleHTTPServer</code>, but you can use whatever server you prefer.
<code><span>cd</span> ~/Desktop/app<br><span># If your Python version is 3.X</span><br><span># On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"</span><br>python3 -m http.server<br><span># If your Python version is 2.X</span><br>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>

Open a tab in Google Chrome and go to locally-hosted version of the site. You should be able to access it via a URL like <code>localhost:8080</code>. The exact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)#Use_in_URLs">port number</a> may be different.

<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The demo

<h3>&emsp;Set up DevTools</h3>
Press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the <strong>Console</strong> panel of DevTools.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/RjZAIMvHhWe2HnMp4XUU.png">

<strong>Figure 2</strong>. The <strong>Console</strong> panel
Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.
Click the <strong>Filesystem</strong> tab.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/eEo5tlYXGVAX6gc4ZY3t.png">
<strong>Figure 3</strong>. The <strong>Filesystem</strong> tab
Click <strong>Add Folder To Workspace</strong>.

Select <code>~/Desktop/app</code>.
Click <strong>Allow</strong> to give DevTools permission to read and write to the directory. In the <strong>Filesystem</strong> tab, there is now a green dot next to <code>index.html</code>, <code>script.js</code>, and <code>styles.css</code>. These green dots mean that DevTools has established a mapping between the network resources of the page, and the files in <code>~/Desktop/app</code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/uPHSpNhpCTrOdwtOyP9D.png">

<strong>Figure 4</strong>. The <strong>Filesystem</strong> tab now shows a mapping between the local files and the network ones
<h2>Step 2: Save a CSS change to disk</h2>
Open <code>~/Desktop/app/styles.css</code> in a text editor. Notice how the <code>color</code> property of <code>h1</code> elements is set to <code>fuchsia</code>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/aYtE6OhxyFc6D6Ur0eXY.png">
<strong>Figure 5</strong>. Viewing <code>styles.css</code> in a text editor
Close the text editor.

Back in DevTools, click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.
Change the value of the <code>color</code> property of the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element to your favorite color. Remember that you need to click the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong> in order to see the CSS rules applied to it in the <strong>Styles</strong> pane. The green dot next to <code>styles.css:1</code> means that any change you make will get mapped to <code>~/Desktop/app/styles.css</code>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/izj9zoJvOeyE4zHJvCC0.png">

<strong>Figure 6</strong>. Setting the <code>color</code> property of the <code>h1</code> element to <code>green</code>
Open <code>~/Desktop/app/styles.css</code> in a text editor again. The <code>color</code> property is now set to your favorite color.
Reload the page. The color of the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element is still set to your favorite color. This works because when you made the change, DevTools saved the change to disk. And then, when you reloaded the page, your local server served the modified copy of the file from disk.

<h2>Step 3: Save an HTML change to disk</h2>
<h3>&emsp;Try changing HTML from the Elements panel</h3>
<span>Warning</span>

<strong>Warning:</strong> The workflow that you're about to try doesn't work. You're trying it now so that you don't waste time later trying to figure out why it's not working.
Click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.
Double click the text content of the <code>h1</code> element, which says <code>Workspaces Demo</code>, and replace it with <code>I  Cake</code>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/aIjt9kcloYh3DT7XlIWV.png">
<strong>Figure 7</strong>. Attempting to change HTML from the <strong>DOM Tree</strong> of the <strong>Elements</strong> panel
Open <code>~/Desktop/app/index.html</code> in a text editor. The change that you just made isn't there.

Reload the page. The page reverts to its original title.
<h4>
Optional: Why it doesn't work</h4>

<strong>Note:</strong> This section describes why the workflow from <a href="#elements">Try changing HTML from the Elements panel</a> doesn't work. You can skip this section if you don't care why.
The tree of nodes that you see on the <strong>Elements</strong> panel represents the page's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">DOM</a>.
To display a page, a browser fetches HTML over the network, parses the HTML, and then converts it into a tree of DOM nodes.

If the page has any JavaScript, that JavaScript may add, delete, or change DOM nodes. CSS can change the DOM, too, via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content"><code>content</code></a> property.
The browser eventually uses the DOM to determine what content it should present to browser users.
Therefore, the final state of the page that users see may be very different from the HTML that the browser fetched.

This makes it difficult for DevTools to resolve where a change made in the <strong>Elements</strong> panel should be saved, because the DOM is affected by HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
In short, the <strong>DOM Tree</strong> <code>!==</code> HTML.
<h3>&emsp;Change HTML from the Sources panel</h3>

If you want to save a change to the page's HTML, do it via the <strong>Sources</strong> panel.
Click the <strong>Sources</strong> tab.
Click the <strong>Page</strong> tab.

Click <strong>(index)</strong>. The HTML for the page opens.
Replace <code>&lt;h1&gt;Workspaces Demo&lt;/h1&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h1&gt;I  Cake&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. See <strong>Figure 11</strong>.
Press Command+S (Mac) or Control+S (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to save the change.

Reload the page. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element is still displaying the new text.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/AMhS744qZFBSt0UHqFjv.png">
<strong>Figure 8</strong>. Line 12 has been set to <code>I  Cake</code>

Open <code>~/Desktop/app/index.html</code>. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element contains the new text.
<h2>Step 4: Save a JavaScript change to disk</h2>
The <strong>Sources</strong> panel is also the place to make changes to JavaScript. But sometimes you need to access other panels, such as the <strong>Elements</strong> panel or the <strong>Console</strong> panel, while making changes to your site. There's a way to have the <strong>Sources</strong> panel open alongside other panels.

Click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab.
Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS). The <strong>Command Menu</strong> opens.
Type <code>QS</code>, then select <strong>Show Quick Source</strong>. At the bottom of your DevTools window there is now a <strong>Quick Source</strong> tab. The tab is displaying the contents of <code>index.html</code>, which is the last file you edited in the <strong>Sources</strong> panel. The <strong>Quick Source</strong> tab gives you the editor from the <strong>Sources</strong> panel, so that you can edit files while having other panels open.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dp21fCa89ezyttjmgzVT.png">
<strong>Figure 9</strong>. Opening the <strong>Quick Source</strong> tab via the <strong>Command Menu</strong>
Press Command+P (Mac) or Control+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the <strong>Open File</strong> dialog. See <strong>Figure 10</strong>.

Type <code>script</code>, then select <strong>app/script.js</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/eoOAA9Pt6Qz3Xfy2PpbZ.png">
<strong>Figure 10</strong>. Opening <code>script.js</code> via the <strong>Open File</strong> dialog

Notice the <code>Save Changes To Disk With Workspaces</code> link in the demo. It's styled regularly.
Add the following code to the bottom of <strong>script.js</strong> via the <strong>Quick Source</strong> tab.
<code>console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'greetings from script.js'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'a'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>style <span>=</span> <span>'font-style:italic'</span><span>;</span></code>

Press Command+S (Mac) or Control+S (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to save the change.
Reload the page. The link on the page is now italic.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Debug Progressive Web Apps</span></h2>
Use the <strong>Application</strong> panel to inspect, modify, and debug web app manifests, service workers, and service worker caches.

Related Guides:
<a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps">Progressive Web Apps</a>
This guide only discusses the Progressive Web App features of the <strong>Application</strong> panel. If you're looking for help on the other panes, check out the last section of this guide, <a href="#other">Other Application panel guides</a>.

<h2>Summary</h2>
Use the <strong>Manifest</strong> pane to inspect your web app manifest and trigger Add to Homescreen events.
Use the <strong>Service Workers</strong> pane for a whole range of service-worker-related tasks, like unregistering or updating a service, emulating push events, going offline, or stopping a service worker.

View your service worker cache from the <strong>Cache Storage</strong> pane.
Unregister a service worker and clear all storage and caches with a single button click from the <strong>Clear storage</strong> pane.
<h2>Web app manifest</h2>

If you want your users to be able to add your app to their mobile homescreens, you need a web app manifest. The manifest defines how the app appears on the homescreen, where to direct the user when launching from homescreen, and what the app looks like on launch.
Related Guides:
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest">Improve user experiences with a Web App Manifest</a>

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners">Using App Install Banners</a>
Once you've got your manifest set up, you can use the <strong>Manifest</strong> pane of the <strong>Application</strong> panel to inspect it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/lcj1XOPDeY6HMzWOE12x.png">

To look at the manifest source, click the link below <strong>App Manifest</strong> label (<code>https://airhorner.com/manifest.json</code> in the screenshot above).
Press the <strong>Add to homescreen</strong> button to simulate an Add to Homescreen event. Check out the next section for more information.
The <strong>Identity</strong> and <strong>Presentation</strong> sections just display fields from the manifest source in a more user-friendly display.

The <strong>Icons</strong> section displays every icon that you've specified.
<h3>&emsp;Simulate Add to Homescreen events</h3>
A web app can only be added to a homescreen when the site is visited at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits. While developing or debugging your Add to Homescreen workflow, this criteria can be inconvenient. The <strong>Add to homescreen</strong> button on the <strong>App Manifest</strong> pane lets you simulate Add to Homescreen events whenever you want.

You can test out this feature with the <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/">Google I/O 2016 progressive web app</a>, which has proper support for Add to Homescreen. Clicking on <strong>Add to Homescreen</strong> while the app is open prompts Chrome to display the "add this site to your shelf" banner, which is the desktop equivalent of the "add to homescreen" banner for mobile devices.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/dcHC145P0QVJTCapLWFd.png">
<strong>Tip</strong>: Keep the <strong>Console</strong> drawer open while simulating Add to Homescreen events. The Console tells you if your manifest has any issues and logs other information about the Add to Homescreen lifecycle.

The <strong>Add to Homescreen</strong> feature cannot yet simulate the workflow for mobile devices. Notice how the "add to shelf" prompt was triggered in the screenshot above, even though DevTools is in Device Mode. However, if you can successfully add your app to your desktop shelf, then it'll work for mobile, too.
If you want to test out the genuine mobile experience, you can connect a real mobile device to DevTools via [remote debugging]<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/">remote debugging</a>, and then click the <strong>Add to Homescreen</strong> button (on DevTools) to trigger the "add to homescreen" prompt on the connected mobile device.
<h2>Service workers</h2>

Service workers are a fundamental technology in the future web platform. They are scripts that the browser runs in the background, separate from a web page. These scripts enable you to access features that don't need a web page or user interaction, like push notifications, background sync, and offline experiences.

If a service worker is installed to the currently open page, then you'll see it listed on this pane. For example, in the screenshot above there's a service worker installed for the scope of <code>https://events.google.com/io2016/</code>.
The <strong>Offline</strong> checkbox puts DevTools into offline mode. This is equivalent to the offline mode available from the <strong>Network</strong> panel, or the <code>Go offline</code> option in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/command-menu/">Command Menu</a>.
The <strong>Update on reload</strong> checkbox forces the service worker to update on every page load.

The <strong>Bypass for network</strong> checkbox bypasses the service worker and forces the browser to go to the network for requested resources.
The <strong>Update</strong> button performs a one-time update of the specified service worker.
The <strong>Push</strong> button emulates a push notification without a payload (also known as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/how-push-works">tickle</a>).

The <strong>Sync</strong> button emulates a background sync event.
The <strong>Unregister</strong> button unregisters the specified service worker. Check out <a href="#clear-storage">Clear storage</a> for a way to unregister a service worker and wipe storage and caches with a single button click.
The <strong>Source</strong> line tells you when the currently running service worker was installed. The link is the name of the service worker's source file. Clicking on the link sends you to the service worker's source.

The <strong>Status</strong> line tells you the status of the service worker. The number on this line (<code>#1</code> in the screenshot above) indicates how many times the service worker has been updated. If you enable the <strong>update on reload</strong> checkbox you'll notice that the number increments on every page load. Next to the status you'll see a <strong>start</strong> button (if the service worker is stopped) or a <strong>stop</strong> button (if the service worker is running). Service workers are designed to be stopped and started by the browser at any time. Explicitly stopping your service worker using the <strong>stop</strong> button can simulate that. Stopping your service worker is a great way to test how your code behaves when the service worker starts back up again. It frequently reveals bugs due to faulty assumptions about persistent global state.
The <strong>Clients</strong> line tells you the origin that the service worker is scoped to. The <strong>focus</strong> button is mostly useful when you've enabled the <strong>show all</strong> checkbox. When that checkbox is enabled, all registered service workers are listed. If you click on the <strong>focus</strong> button next to a service worker that is running in a different tab, Chrome focuses on that tab.
If the service worker causes any errors, a new label called <strong>Errors</strong> shows up.

<h2>Service worker caches</h2>
The <strong>Cache Storage</strong> pane provides a read-only list of resources that have been cached using the (service worker) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache">Cache API</a>.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/KLqhHBwpNPFGTiv1kUTR.png">
Note that the first time you open a cache and add a resource to it, DevTools might not detect the change. Reload the page and you should see the cache.
If you've got two or more caches open, you'll see them listed below the <strong>Cache Storage</strong> dropdown.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/mK84c0i8pMq3hPTXCNpv.png">
<h2>Quota usage</h2>
Some responses within the Cache Storage pane may be flagged as being "<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/glossary#opaque-response">opaque</a>". This refers to a response retrieved from a different origin, like from a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/glossary#CDN">CDN</a> or remote API, when <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol">CORS</a> is not enabled.

In order to avoid leakage of cross-domain information, there's significant padding added to the size of an opaque response used for calculating storage quota limits (i.e. whether a <code>QuotaExceeded</code> exception is thrown) and reported by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/08/estimating-available-storage-space"><code>navigator.storage</code> API</a>.
The details of this padding vary from browser to browser, but for Google Chrome, this means that the <em>minimum</em> size that any single cached opaque response contributes to the overall storage usage is <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=796060#c17">approximately 7 megabytes</a>. You should keep this in mind when determining how many opaque responses you want to cache, since you could easily exceeded storage quota limitations much sooner than you'd otherwise expect based on the actual size of the opaque resources.

<h2>Clear storage</h2>

The <strong>Clear Storage</strong> pane is a very useful feature when developing progressive web apps. This pane lets you unregister service workers and clear all caches and storage with a single button click. Check out the section below to learn more.

<h2><br><span class="orange">Understand security issues</span></h2>
Use the <strong>Security</strong> Panel in Chrome DevTools to make sure HTTPS is properly implemented on a page. See <a href="https://web.dev/why-https">Why HTTPS Matters</a> to learn why every website should be protected with HTTPS, even sites that don't handle sensitive user data.
<h2>Open the Security panel</h2>

The <strong>Security</strong> panel is the main place in DevTools for inspecting the security of a page.
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/">Open DevTools</a>.
Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab to open the <strong>Security</strong> panel.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/WnYbcLXh2TCkhoVh9Jub.png">
<strong>Figure 1</strong>. The Security panel
<h2>Common problems</h2>

<h3>&emsp;Non-secure main origins</h3>
When the main origin of a page is not secure, the <strong>Security Overview</strong> says <strong>This page is not secure</strong>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/37YwtqHGHTituFBvm74p.png">

<strong>Figure 2</strong>. A non-secure page
This problem occurs when the URL that you visited was requested over HTTP. To make it secure you need to request it over HTTPS. For example, if you look at the URL in your address bar, it probably looks similar to <code>http://example.com</code>. To make it secure the URL should be <code>https://example.com</code>.
If you've already got HTTPS set up on your server, all you need to do to fix this problem is configure your server to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

If you don't have HTTPS set up on your server, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> provides a free and relatively-easy way to start the process. Or, you might consider hosting your site on a CDN. Most major CDNs host sites on HTTPS by default now.
<strong>Tip</strong> The <a href="https://web.dev/redirects-http/">Redirect HTTP Traffic To HTTPS</a> audit in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> can help automate the process of making sure that all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
<h3>&emsp;Mixed content</h3>

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content">Mixed content</a> means that the main origin of a page is secure, but the page requested resources from non-secure origins. Mixed content pages are only partially protected because the HTTP content is accessible to sniffers and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://wd.imgix.net/image/admin/T1250jd5mFG2827izkwI.png">
<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Mixed content

In <strong>Figure 3</strong> above, clicking <strong>View 1 request in Network panel</strong> opens the <strong>Network</strong> panel and applies the <code>mixed-content:displayed</code> filter so that the <strong>Network Log</strong> only shows non-secure resources.

<h2><br><span class="orange">View page resources</span></h2>

This guide teaches you how to use Chrome DevTools to view a web page's resources. Resources are the files that a page needs in order to display correctly. Examples of resources include CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files, as well as images.
This guide assumes that you're familiar with the basics of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">web development</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#start">Chrome DevTools</a>.
<h2>Open resources</h2>

When you know the name of the resource that you want to inspect, the <strong>Command Menu</strong> provides a fast way of opening the resource.
Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac). The <strong>Open File</strong> dialog opens.

Here's a breakdown of the non-obvious items in <strong>Figure 6</strong>:

<strong>top</strong> is the main document <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">browsing context</a>.
<strong>airhorner.com</strong> represents a domain. All resources nested under it come from that domain. For example, the full URL of the <strong>comlink.global.js</strong> file is probably <code>https://airhorner.com/scripts/comlink.global.js</code>.
<strong>scripts</strong> is a directory.

<strong>(index)</strong> is the main HTML document.
<strong>iu3</strong> is another browsing context. This context was probably created by an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element embedded in the main document HTML.
<strong>sw.js</strong> is a service worker execution context.

Click a resource to view it in the <strong>Editor</strong>.
