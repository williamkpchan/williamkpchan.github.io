<center><h1>A quick introduction to the dplyr mutate function</h1>

<div id="toc"></div></center>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Let's quickly run through the basics of mutate.  </p>
<p>Before we do that though, let's talk about <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<h3>What is dplyr?</h3>
<p>If you're reading this blog post, you're probably an R user.  And there's a good chance that you're trying to figure out how to use the functions from <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not 100% familiar with it, <a href="https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/dplyr-intro-data-manipulation-with-r/"><code>dplyr</code> is an add-on package</a> for the R programming language.  The <code>dplyr</code> package is a toolkit that is exclusively for data manipulation.  More specifically, it is a toolkit for performing the data manipulation tasks that I listed above.  It has one function for each of those core data manipulation tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>select()</code> selects columns from data</li>
<li><code>filter()</code> <a href="https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/dplyr-filter/">subsets rows of data</a></li>
<li><code>group_by()</code> aggregates data</li>
<li><code>summarise()</code> summarises data (calculating summary statistics)</li>
<li><code>arrange()</code> sorts data</li>
<li><code>mutate()</code> creates new variables</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, <code>dplyr</code> only does these tasks.  It essentially has one function for each of them. (Note that these <code>dplyr</code> &#8220;functions&#8221; are sometimes called &#8220;verbs&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Part of what makes <code>dplyr</code> great is that it is &#8220;compact.&#8221;  There are only 5 or 6 major tools and they are simple to use.</p>
<p>Now that we've discussed what <code>dplyr</code> is, let's focus in on the <code>mutate()</code> function so you can learn how to use mutate in R.</p>
<h3>What is the mutate function?</h3>
<p>The <code>mutate()</code> function is a function for creating new variables.  Essentially, that's all it does.  Like all of the <code>dplyr</code> functions, it is designed to do one thing.</p>
<h3>How to use mutate in R</h3>
<p>Using <code>mutate()</code> is very straightforward.  In fact, using any of the <code>dplyr</code> functions is very straightforward, because they are quite well designed.</p>
<p>When you use <code>mutate()</code>, you need typically to specify 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the dataframe you want to modify</li>
<li>the name of the new variable that you'll create</li>
<li>the value you will assign to the new variable</li>
</ul>
<p>So when you use <code>mutate()</code>, you'll call the function by name.  Then the first argument is the dataframe that you want to manipulate. </p>
<p>For example, if you had a dataframe named <code>df</code>, that would be the first item inside of the parenthasis (i.e., the first &#8220;argument&#8221; to the mutate function): </p>
<p><img src="	https://vrzkj25a871bpq7t1ugcgmn9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mutate-in-r_syntax-explanation.png"></p>
<p>Remember that <code>mutate()</code> – like all of the <code>dplyr</code> functions – strictly operates on dataframes.  It's not set up to work with lists, matrices, vectors, or other data structures.</p>
<p>Ok, so the first argument is the name of the dataframe.</p>
<p>The second argument is a &#8220;name-value&#8221; pair.  That might sound a little arcane, so let me explain it.</p>
<p>When you use <code>mutate()</code>, you're basically creating a variable.  The new variable needs a name, but it also needs a value that gets assigned to that name.  So when you use mutate, you provide the name and the new value &#8230; a name-value pair.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at our syntax example again:</p>
<p><img src="https://vrzkj25a871bpq7t1ugcgmn9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mutate-in-r_syntax-explanation.png"></p>
<p>You can see here in this dummy code example that we're creating a new variable called <code>new_variable</code>.  The value assigned to <code>new_variable</code> is the value of <code>existing_var</code> multiplied by 2.  Note that in this example, we're assuming a dataframe called df that already has a variable called <code>existing_var</code>.  </p>
<p>That's really it.  To use mutate in R, all you need to do is call the function, specify the dataframe, and specify the name-value pair for the new variable you want to create.  </p>
<h2>Example: how to use mutate in R</h2>
<p>The explanation I just gave is pretty straightforward, but to make it more concrete, let's work with some actual data.</p>
<p>Here, I'll show you how to use the <code>mutate()</code> function from <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<p>First, let's load a few packages.  We'll load <code>dplyr</code> so we have access to the <code>mutate()</code> function.  We'll also load the <code>ISLR</code> package.  <code>ISLR</code> is a package that contains several datasets.  For the record, this package is actually related to the excellent book, an Introduction to Statistical Learning &#8230; a book about machine learning.  We won't be doing any machine learning here, but if you're interested, get that book.</p>
<p>Ok. Here's the code to load the packages.</p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">
#--------------
# LOAD PACKAGES
#--------------
library(dplyr)
library(ISLR)
</pre>
<p>We'll be working with the <code>Auto</code> dataframe from <code>ISLR</code>.</p>
<p>Before we actually do anything with the data, let's just inspect it.</p>
<p>Here we'll print out the dataframe.</p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">
#-------------
# INSPECT DATA
#-------------

print(Auto)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://vrzkj25a871bpq7t1ugcgmn9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/auto-data-print-1024x506.png"><br />
When you print it out, you can see that the data is a little hard to read.  <code>print()</code> will print out every row of data.  </p>
<p>Before we move on, let's fix that.</p>
<p>The reason that the <code>print()</code> function prints out every row of data is because the <code>Auto</code> dataframe is an old-fashioned <code>data.frame</code> object, not a <code>tibble</code>.  Tibbles print better. Keep in mind that tibbles actually <u>are</u> dataframes, but they are modified dataframes. One of the things that is different about tibbles is that they print out with better formatting.</p>
<p>That being the case, I'm going to quickly coerce <code>Auto</code> to a <code>tibble</code> using <code>as.tibble()</code>.</p>
<p>As I do this, I'll also rename it to <code>auto_specs</code>.  The name <code>Auto</code> is a little non-descript, and it starts with a capital letter, which I don't like.  So very quickly, I'll rename it while I'm coercing it to a tibble. </p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">
#-------------------------------
# RENAME DATA &amp; COERCE TO TIBBLE
#-------------------------------
auto_specs &lt;- as.tibble(Auto)

print(auto_specs)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://vrzkj25a871bpq7t1ugcgmn9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/auto-data_tibble_print-1080x368.png"></p>
<p>This is much better.</p>
<p>You can see that when we print it out now, the <code>auto_specs</code> has a slightly more readable structure.  This is because we coerced this data to a <code>tibble</code>.</p>
<p>Ok.  Now we're ready to use <code>mutate()</code>.</p>
<p>This is very straightforward.  </p>
<p>We're going to call the <code>mutate()</code> function, and the first argument (the first item inside the paranthesis) is the dataframe we're going to modify, <code>auto_specs</code>.</p>
<p>After that (and separated by a comma) we have the name-value pair for our new variable. The name of the new variable is <code>hp_to_weight</code> and the value is <code>horsepower</code> divided by <code>weight</code>.</p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">
#----------------------------------
# CREATE NEW VARIABLE WITH mutate()
#----------------------------------

auto_specs_new &lt;- mutate(auto_specs, hp_to_weight = horsepower / weight)

print(auto_specs_new)
</pre>
<p>That's basically it.  Using mutate in R to create a new variable is as simple as that.</p>
<h3>A quick warning &#8230; save your data</h3>
<p>There's one thing that I want to point out.  Notice that to the left hand side of the <code>mutate()</code> function, I've used the assignment operator, <code><-</code>.  </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I did this so that the new output of <code>mutate()</code> is "saved" to the <code>auto_specs</code> data.</p>
<p>All of the <code>dplyr</code> functions work with dataframes.  The inputs to the <code>dplyr</code> functions are dataframes.  The outputs are also dataframes. So, mutate outputs a dataframe.</p>
<p>But by default, the <code>dplyr</code> functions send the output directly to the console.  </p>
<p>What that means is that the <code>dplyr</code> functions do <em>not</em> automatically change the input dataframe.  </p>
<p>Let me repeat that. The <code>dplyr</code> functions do <em>not</em> automatically change the input dataframe.</p>
<p>What that means is that if you <em>don't</em> use the assignment operator to save the output with a name, the changes will not be saved to the input dataset.</p>
<p>To see this, try running <code>mutate()</code> without saving the output to a new dataframe.  Run the <code>mutate()</code> function, and then print out the original input dataframe.</p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">
mutate(auto_specs, hp_to_weight = horsepower / weight)

colnames(auto_specs)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://vrzkj25a871bpq7t1ugcgmn9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/auto-data-colames-1080x57.png"></p>
<p>Take a look at the column names. <code>hp_to_weight</code> is not one of them!</p>
<p>That's because <code>mutate()</code> does not directly modify the input dataframe.  It leaves the input dataframe unchanged and then produces an output dataframe which is sent to the console by default (i.e., the console just prints the output).</p>
<p>If you want to <em>save</em> the output, you need to use the assignment operator and and save the output to an object name:</p>
<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">
auto_specs_new &lt;- mutate(auto_specs, hp_to_weight = horsepower / weight)
print(auto_specs_new)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://vrzkj25a871bpq7t1ugcgmn9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/auto-data-with-new-variable-1080x373.png"></p>
<p>Notice that when we print out <code>auto_specs_new</code>, it now has the new variable <code>hp_to_weight</code>.</p>
<p>Let this be a reminder: if you want to add a new variable to a dataframe with <code>mutate()</code>, and you want that change to be permanent, you need to save the output by using the assignment operator.</p>
