<div class="full module moduleText" id="mod_36616169"><h2 class="subtitle">What perfumes are made of</h2><div  class="txtd" id="txtd_36616169"><h3>Ingredients of perfume</h3><p>Perfumes are made up of base perfume oils -- plant, animal or synthetic. Most are then watered down with alcohol (Ethanol) to make them light. Although you can make some from just fresh flower parts and water such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.squidoo.com/makeperfume?bypass=true#module12588022">Recipe #1</a> below.</p><p>PLANT:</p><p>The flowers and blossoms are mostly used. However, other parts such as leaves, twigs, roots, rhizomes, bulbs, seeds, fruit, wood and back can also be used. You can make your own or buy <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.squidoo.com/makeperfume?bypass=true#module9934961">essential oils</a> which are simply the "oil of" the plant material. Essential oil is also known as ethereal oils.</p><p>Other Plant Sources include Lichens such as oakmoss and treemoss thailli and seaweed. Seaweed is not often used due to the high cost and low potency.</p><p>ANIMAL:</p><p>Perfumes are also made from the musk of some animals such as Asian Musk Deer or Civets; Ambergris aka Amber, a fatty compound secreted by sperm whale; Honeycomb from the honeybee; Castoreum from North American Beaver odor sacs.</p><p>SYNTHETIC:</p><p>Several chemical compounds can also be used through organic synthesis to produce perfumes including: Terpenes, Coumarin, Linalool and Calone. These produce smells not know in nature.</p></div>

For instance, perfume and perfume oils are two different things. Our modern, store bought perfumes traces its beginnings to perfume oils.</p><p>In ancient Egypt, perfume oils were given as special gifts to royalty. Today, perfume oils have degraded down to what we know as perfume which we can buy at perfume counters in our favorite shops and department stores.</p><p>The basic difference between the two is in the strength and concentration of scent. Perfume oils are highly concentrated and will yield a purer fragrance which will last much longer than its modern counterpart.</p><p>This makes perfume oils much more valuable and expensive than regular perfumes.</p><p>Some individuals find that they develop allergic reactions to the high concentrations of essential oils so it is prudent to test just a little on your skin. After all, a little is all you need.</p></div>

Basically, they are extracted concentrated scents from plants.</p><p>What's really interesting to me is that sometimes, the different parts of a particular aromatic plant can produce different smells and the nuances of each can be used and blended along with other essential oils from totally different plants to create that wonderfully unique fragrance.</p><p>I was never good at chemistry so I was surprised just how easy it is to make my own perfume. I purchase the essential oils I use instead of extracting them myself from the plants. You decide which you'd rather do.</p><p>If you purchase essential oils, however, make sure you get them from a reputable source so that you can be sure that you get 100% essential oils rather than those with additives. The higher the concentration of the essential oils, the more aromatic it is.</p><p>Carrier Oil</p><p>Such as Almond, Apricot Kernel or Jojoba.
