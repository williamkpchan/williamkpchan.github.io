<h2><span class="orange">Installing Inkscape on Windows</span></h2>
Inkscape is available for Microsoft Windows operating systems from XP up toWindows 10. There are two basic methods for installing Inkscape ontocomputers with a Windows operating system. One method is downloadingand installing directly from Inkscape and the other is installing itfrom the Microsoft App store. A description of both methods ispresented here.
Attention
If you had previously installed Inkscape onto your computer, you will needto uninstall that version before installing the new version.
<h2>Method 1: Downloading and installing directly from Inkscape</h2>
Using a Web browser, go to the Inkscape website’s <a href="https://inkscape.org/releases/">download page forWindows</a> and select the best download for your system. 
If you are unsure if you need the 32-bit or 64-bit version, read the section about: Identifying Your System Architecture first.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape4.png">

Select an installation method from the available choices (: <b>portable</b>) and wait for it todownload. 
You should either see a window giving you the option to savethe file, or a pop-up appear in your web browser withthe file’s name and a timer stating how long until the download iscomplete.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape5.png">

Once the download is complete, either click on the file in the lowerleft corner of your screen to start the installation process or, if needbe, go to your file explorer, open your downloads folder and selectthe file from there. 
It should be the first file at the top of thefolder.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape6.png">

<strong>OR</strong>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape7.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape8.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape9.png">

If you get a <b>User Account Control</b> pop-up from Windows similarto the following one click “OK” and wait for the Inkscape installation program to start.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape10.2.png">

Select what language you want to use during the installation andclick <b>OK</b>. 
Then click <b>Next</b> on both the followingwelcome screen and license agreement screen.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape11.png">

On the <b>Choose Components</b> screen you can select which featuresyou want to install or not install. 
In most cases the default options should provide all that the user needs, so click <b>Next</b>.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape12.png">

On the <b>Choose Install Location</b> window leave the destinationfolder as <code><b>C:\Program</b> <b>Files\Inkscape</b></code> and click<b>Install</b> unless you want Inkscape to be installed in aspecific location on your computer.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape13.png">

(Optional step)
If you do want to install Inkscape in a specific location on yourcomputer, click the <b>Browse</b> button and in the resulting windoweither make a new folder for Inkscape and select it or select thedestination folder you want Inkscape to be installed to.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/InkScape14.png">

Once you click <b>Install</b>, a progress bar will appear showinghow long it will take for your program to install.
After the installation is complete, click <b>Finish</b> andthe installer will automatically open Inkscape for you. 
You areready to begin working with Inkscape.

Congratulations! You have now installed Inkscape onto your Windowscomputer.
If you need further help, please visit <a href="https://inkscape.ort/learn/faq/#windows-specific-issues">the FAQ section for Windowsspecific problems</a> on the Inkscape website.
<h2>Identifying Your System Architecture</h2>
Before you can begin to download Inkscape, you must first know what typeof operating system (OS) you have, 32-bit or 64-bit. 
If you already knowwhat type of operating system you have please skip this section and gothe section on downloading Inkscape.
<h2>Method 1: Using Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
Press <kbd >Win</kbd> + <kbd >r</kbd> to open the Windows Run dialog.
Type “msinfo32” and press <kbd >Enter</kbd>.
Now in the new dialog, toward the middle of the screen, you should see anoption that says <b>System Type</b>. 
Write down the associated information.
You will need this to select the correct Inkscape download file for yoursystem.

<h2>Method 2: Using the mouse</h2>
Click on the magnifying glass to open a search dialog and type‘system’.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/install_win_start_sys.png">

Click to open the <b>System</b> control panel.
Depending on the version of MS Windows on your computer, you may see one of the dialogs shown below. 
Now on that dialog, towards the middle of the screen, you should see anoption that says <b>System Type</b>. 
Write down the associated information.
You will need this to select the correct Inkscape download file for yoursystem.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/install_win_system.png">


<h2><span class="orange">The User Interface</h2>
Inkscape shows a window for each opened document. Each window contains
the toolbars and a white, empty area.</p>
In this manual, we use the <span class="pink">Wide</span> view which puts the first toolbar
on the right. You can get this view with the menu by selecting <span class="blue">View ‣ Wide</span>.</p>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/interface_areas.png" />
<span class="orange">The main areas of the Inkscape user interface</span></p>

The application <strong>menu bar</strong> along the top provides general menu
options. Some are similar to other software programs (<span class="blue">File
‣ Save</span>, <span class="blue">Edit ‣ Copy</span>, etc.). There are also
Inkscape-specific items.

The <strong>tool controls bar</strong> just below adjusts to the currently selected
tool. It displays the tool’s options.

Vertically on the left, the <strong>toolbox</strong> contains the main drawing
tools. Only one tool can be selected at once.

The large blank area is the <strong>canvas</strong>, where the image is edited.

A black outline represents the visible <strong>page area</strong>.

On the right side of the window, there are two toolbars. To the left
is the <strong>commands bar</strong> which gives quick access to common commands,
which are also available via the dropdown menus. If not all the
commands are shown, there is a right-facing arrow that gives access
to the hidden choices.

To the right is the <strong>snap controls bar</strong>. We suggest you deactivate
snapping for now, by pressing the topmost button in the bar, or by
pressing <kbd>%</kbd>.

There are <strong>rulers</strong> at the top and on the left of the canvas to help
with grid and guideline placement.

<strong>Scrollbars</strong> are available to the right and bottom to move around on
the canvas.

The <strong>color palette</strong> is near the bottom of the window. Its
most basic usage is to change the fill color of an object.

At the very bottom, the <strong>status bar</strong> provides information such as the
colors of the selected object, layers, cursor coordinates, and zoom
level. It also contains a field where Inkscape can display helpful
texts, such as the number and type of selected objects, or tips about
keyboard shortcuts and usage hints. Whenever Inkscape doesn’t do what
you think it should be doing, look here first.

Dialogs for specific functionality are available will by default appear
attached to the right of the canvas, in the <strong>docking area</strong>.


<h2><span class="orange">Managing the workspace</span></h2>
<h2>Document Properties Dialog</h2>
By default, Inkscape creates documents in a size that fits your operatingsystem language (that is, in the US, you get a different default documentthan in Germany, for example). 
To change the page size, click<b>File : Document properties…</b> (or click on the next to lasticon on the commands bar, which looks like 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/doc-prop.png">
, or use the <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd> keyboard shortcut). 
In the section <b>Page Size</b> on the <b>Page</b> tab, select or define the size you wish.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/document_properties_dialog_win10_1.png">

The default measurement unit for page size can be changed in the <b>Page Size</b> section of the same <b>Page</b> tab.
The large rectangular line that you see on the canvas, in a new blankdocument, is the page border. 
If you compare the page border to therulers, you can see that it represents the page size. 
Note that the pageborder is never seen in exported or saved files.
Most of the time, everything that you want to show up in your finisheddrawing, must be inside this border. 
Elements placed outside of the pageborder usually can’t be seen when you share your drawing, and can bethought of as drafts, experiments or available resources.
If you do not want to see the page border while you’re working, you canuncheck the option <b>Show page border</b> in the <b>Page</b> tabto hide it. 
You can also configure the page shadow and color of that shadow,in that section, if you like.
In Inkscape, the canvas appears white. 
Even though it does not use thetraditional checkerboard pattern to indicate transparency (by default),it really is transparent. 
If you’d like to see a checkerboard patternfor transparency, please check the <b>Checkerboard background</b> optionin the section <b>Background</b> on the Page tab.
When a drawing is exported to a : <b>PNG</b> format, areas on the page wherethere is no object will be transparent. 
You can change this by puttingan opaque object behind your drawing (usually a rectangle, the same sizeas the page).
Another way to change this is by clicking on the color bar in the<b>Background</b> section of the <b>Page</b> tab, and setting the<b>A</b> slider (“A” for : <b>Alpha</b>) to 255, or all the way to theright. 
You can also change the color, if you like. 
Note that this settingonly affects how the image looks in Inkscape or when you export to PNG.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/background_color_dialog_win10.png">

<h2>Options in ‘View’ Menu</h2>
Many people use Inkscape with no scrollbars and no snapping. 
Anyunneeded bars can be hidden in the menu <b>View : Show/hide</b>. 
The canvas can be moved using the middle mouse button.

<h2><span class="orange">Ways of Drawing in Inkscape</span></h2>
Inkscape offers several ways for creating vector images, which can, of course, be combined:
using the geometric shape tools
using the path tools, much like a pencil on paper
starting from a photo, a scanned image, or any raster graphic by using a tracing engine
using one of the many available features that let you create elements of a drawing automatically

Often there are more than one ways to achieve the same result. 
Soon you will develop your own habits and preferences for drawing with Inkscape. 
Only very rarely, there is one way, and <strong>only</strong> one way, to accomplish something.
In this section, we’ll start out by exploring the easiest way to create a drawing in Inkscape: the shape tools. 
We will also get to know some of the most commonly used tools or features. 
If you have any prior experience with raster graphics (such as editing photos), you will also begin to discover how creating and editing vector graphics is so very different.

<h2><span class="orange">The Shape Tools</span></h2>
Geometric shapes, despite their simple look, are useful for many drawingtechniques (and not only vector drawing). 
With path operations (Union,Difference, etc…), you can quickly get awesome results from someelementary shapes. 
You can even further improve that with path tools.Both path operations and path tools are detailed in later sections.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/shape-tools-icons.png">

Let’s draw some geometric shapes. 
All the shape tools follow similarrules to let you create and edit your shapes. 
But each tool has specificoptions: for example, a circle can become a pie wedge, or a rectanglecan have its corners rounded.
To create a geometric shape:
enable the relevant tool in the toolbar by clicking on it;
on the canvas, press the mouse button and hold while you drag the mouse;
release the mouse button to display the shape.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/shape-tool-click-and-drag_2.png">

<em>Click and drag to create a shape.</em>
Once the mouse is released and the shape is displayed, various handleswill become visible. 
Many of Inkscape’s tools use handlesfor one purpose or another. 
But it’s the handles of the geometric shapeswhich are used for creating many fancy and exciting effects. 
The handlesmay be tiny circles, squares and/or diamonds. 
Sometimes, the samehandles can be available for different tools. 
We will learn more abouteach handle’s function in the following chapters.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/shape-tools-handles_1.png">

<em>Primitive shapes provide handles as squares, circles or diamonds.</em>
Many features of Inkscape are accessible through keyboard shortcuts, andsometimes even <em>only</em> through key shortcuts. 
While drawing your shape:
press <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> while you drag the mouse, with the Rectangle andEllipse tools, to create <strong>squares</strong> and <strong>circles</strong>;
press <kbd >Shift</kbd> while you drag to draw from the center, ratherthan from one corner.

Try drawing some shapes, with and without those keys to get an idea ofhow they can be used.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/ellipses-cloud-example.png">

<em>Sketching a cloud from ellipses.</em>

<h2><span class="orange">The Selector Tool</span></h2>
<a href="_images/selector-tool.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/selector-tool.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;"></a> <kbd >F1</kbd> or <kbd >S</kbd>
The Selector tool is a fundamental tool in the program, since almost everythingmust be selected before it can be edited.
Working much like a hand, the Selector tool also <strong>moves, scales, skews androtates</strong> objects.
To move an object:
position the mouse over an object;
press the mouse button and hold, while dragging it to the desiredposition (hold <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> to move the shape in horizontal orvertical direction only);
release the mouse button.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/select-tool-move-scale.png">

<em>Drag to move the selection. 
Transformations (such as moving, scaling,rotating) are easy thanks to the two-way arrows. 
Click the selection asecond time to access skew and rotating functions.</em>
To scale (change the size of) an object:
click on it to select it;
position the mouse over a two-way arrow on a side or a corner;
press the mouse button and hold while dragging it to the desired size(hold <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> if you want to preserve the proportions);
release the mouse button.

To skew an object:
select it, then click it again;
position the mouse over a horizontal or vertical two-way arrow;
press the mouse button and hold, while dragging it to the desiredamount of skew (also hold <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> for 15° steps)
release the mouse button.

To rotate an object:
select it, then click it again;
grab a curved two-way arrow in any corner;
drag it until the object reaches the desired angle (hold<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> for rotating in steps of 15°).

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/select-tool-skew-rotate.png">

In some cases, you want to edit more than one object at once. 
So theSelect tool can select more than one object at once.
To select more than one object, there are mainly two ways:
click the first object, then hold <kbd >Shift</kbd> while clicking eachadditional object once;
or press the mouse button and drag out a rectangular selection boxwhich encloses all the objects.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/select-tool-selection-frame.png">

<em>Each selected object is framed with a dashed line (known as thebounding box), while the two-way arrows for transformation are placedaround the entire selection (one or more than one object).</em>
You can combine the two methods: hold <kbd >Shift</kbd> to keep previouslyselected objects selected, and drag out a selection box to add moreobjects to the selection. 
Doing this the other way around works, too: afterselecting more than one object by dragging a selection box, hold <kbd >Shift</kbd>while you individually click on more objects.
Also notice how the <kbd >Shift</kbd> key allows you to sort of toggle a selection:click to add to the selection, click again to remove.

<h2><span class="orange">Squares and Rectangles</span></h2>
<a href="_images/rectangle_tool.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/rectangle_tool.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;"></a> <kbd >F4</kbd> or <kbd >R</kbd>
To draw a rectangle:
Select the Rectangle tool from the toolbox on the left.
Click and drag the mouse diagonally, using the same motion as when dragging aselection box.


The rectangle will appear immediately after you releasethe mouse button. 
To draw a perfect square, hold down <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> whileclick-dragging with the mouse.
The square-shaped handles can be used to change the rectangle’s size.However, when you only want to change either the height or the width ofthe rectangle, it’s hard to control with the mouse alone. 
Here you canuse <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> to restrict the size change to either width or heightof the rectangle.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/rectangle_square_handles_1.png">

<em>When you hold down Ctrl while dragging the square-shaped handles, it iseasy to limit the change in the rectangle’s size to a single direction.</em>
The circle-shaped handles are for rounding the corners. 
Grab a circlehandle and move it just a tiny bit. 
You’ll see that all four cornerswill be rounded. 
Additionally, a second circular handle has appeared now. 
Eachhandle changes the amount of rounding in one direction. 
It is notpossible to only round a single corner of the rectangle independant fromthe others. 
They will all change together.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/rectangle_circular_handles.png">

<em>Moving the circle handles rounds the corners. 
Each circle handlechanges the radii in a different direction.</em>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/rectangle_corner_radii.png">

<em>The “Rx” and “Ry” values on the control bar, determine the radius ofthe imaginary circle which the rounding is based upon.</em>
To restore the initial, sharp-cornered shape of a rectangle or square,click on the far right icon in the tool control bar <a href="_images/rectangle_make_corners_sharp_icon.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/rectangle_make_corners_sharp_icon.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;"></a>. 
This is very useful, when you’re still learning how to master theusage of the circular handles!
When you need to draw a rectangle with accurate dimensions, you can usethe tool controls bar:
the field labelled <b>W</b> is for the width;
the field labelled <b>H</b> is for the height;
the <b>Rx</b> and <b>Ry</b> fields define the rounding radius forthe corners.

The dropdown behind each number entry field allows you to select the unit youneed for your rectangle.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/rect-tool-controls-bar_win10.png">


<h2><span class="orange">Circles, Ellipses and Arcs</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/draw-ellipse.svg">
<kbd >F5</kbd> or <kbd >E</kbd>
To draw a circle or ellipse, click and drag the mouse diagonally, using the samemotion as when dragging a selection box. 
The circle will appear immediately afteryou release the mouse button. 
To draw a perfect circle, hold down the <kbd >Ctrl</kbd>key while you drag the mouse. 
Holding <kbd >Shift</kbd> will start drawing from thecenter of the shape.
The Ellipse tool also allows you to draw arcs and circle segments (or “piewedges”). 
To draw an arc, grab the round handle and drag it, always keeping themouse pointer on the inside of the (imaginary) circle.
To draw a segment (“pie wedge”), drag the round handle, always keeping the mousepointer on the outside of the (imaginary) circle.
After the first drag, you’ll see a second round handle appear. 
You can set aspecific angle for these shapes on the control bar, using the <b>Start</b>and <b>End</b> fields. 
Note that the three buttons to the right of thosefields do not become activated until after you have dragged the circle handles.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/ellipse_tool_square_handles.png">
<b>Dragging the square handles converts a circle into an ellipse.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/ellipse_tool_round_handles.png">
<b>The round handles convert the shape into an arc or segment (“pie wedge”),depending on the position of the mouse (inside or outside the imaginarycircle) as you drag the handle.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/ellipse_tool_tool_controls.png">
<b>The <b>Start</b> and <b>End</b> fields, on the tool controls barindicate the angles between which the pie or arc extends.</b>
To quickly restore the circle/ellipse shape, click the far right icon in thetool controls bar: 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/draw-ellipse-whole.svg">.
To convert an ellipse into a perfect circle, click on one of the square handleswhile pressing <kbd >Ctrl</kbd>. 
The top and left square handles change the size ofthe ellipse in vertical and horizontal direction, respectively.
To create a circle with a specific size, you can use the fields for the horizontal and vertical radius <b>Rx</b> and <b>Ry</b> in the tool controls bar.

<h2><span class="orange">Stars and Polygons</span></h2>
<a href="_images/star-tool-icon.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/star-tool-icon.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;"></a> <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >F9</kbd> or <kbd >*</kbd>
The Star/Polygon tool is perhaps the most exciting tool for beginners,and sets Inkscape apart from other vector editing software! It offersnumerous creative options which can be edited on the canvas with ease.
As with the other geometric shape tools, drag the mouse on the canvas using asimilar process as dragging a selection box. 
The default star, which has5 points, will be displayed with its 2 diamond-shaped handles, as soonas the mouse button is released.
If you need your star rotated in a specific angle, you can hold down<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> while drawing it. 
This will make it ‘snap’ in 15° steps. 
If youdrag the mouse downwards, the tip where the mouse cursor is will bepositioned exactly at 6 o’clock (or south).
The handle that is situated in the crease between two of the star’s tipschanges the inner diameter. 
The other handle changes the length of the star’stips.
When you press <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> while dragging the star’s handles, you can changethe tips’ length and the inner radius without also rotating or twistingthe star.
The field labelled <b>Spoke Ratio</b> on the tool controls bar will alsowork without any turning or twisting the star. 
You can use the up and down arrowsbeside the field to change the number there, too. 
Even holding the mouse cursorabove the field and using the scroll wheel will work.

<em>The handle in the crease between two tips lets you make changes to theinner diameter of the star. 
Without holding down Ctrl, it can bedifficult to avoid twisting the star. 
The other handle is used to changethe length of the tips.</em>
If you prefer to draw a polygon, click the icon on the control bar,which is shown below.

<em>In Polygon mode, the shape only has a single handle: This handleenlarges or shrinks the shape. 
The star can be twisted, if you do nothold the Ctrl key.</em>
With these few options, it’s already possible to create many differentshapes, starting from a single star. 
But there are even more options! Toadd more tips to a star or more sides to a polygon, either enter thenumber of tips you want, in the field <b>Corners</b> in the tool controlsbar or click on the up/down arrows right beside it.
To round the tips of a star or the corners of a polygon, you can holddown <kbd >Shift</kbd> while dragging any of the handles. 
The farther youdrag them, the more rounding you will get (drag the mouse horizontallyfor best results). 
Or as before, either use the arrows next to the field<b>Rounded</b> in the tool controls bar, or change its value by entering anew one.
When you press <kbd >Alt</kbd> while dragging a handle, this will add somerandomness to the star or polygon. 
Or as before, use the number field with thearrows to change the value for <b>Randomized</b>. 
A star’s tipswill then all be of different length, and a polygon will look distorted.

<h2><span class="orange">Spirals</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/spiral_tool.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;"></a> <kbd >F9</kbd> or <kbd >I</kbd>
This geometrical shape isn’t needed frequently, but sometimes, it provesto be very useful.
To draw a spiral, click and drag with the mouse on the canvas. 
When the left mouse button is released, the spiral will be finished. 
You will notice two diamond-shaped handles on the spiral.
These handles change the length of the spiral. 
You can try this outright on the canvas: Just grab one of the handles and drag it along thespiral’s turns to get the desired number of turns and to make the spirallarger or smaller.
If you hold down <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> while dragging the handles, the spiral will getlonger (or shorter) in 15° steps.
When you combine pressing <kbd >Alt</kbd> with pulling the inner handleupwards or downwards, it will change the divergence (tightness) /convergence (looseness) of the spiral, without changing its overall size.Dragging upwards makes the turns move toward the outside of the spiral.Dragging downwards will make them move closer to its center.
The easiest way to change the number of turns of a spiral quickly by alarge amount is to enter the desired number into the field labelled<b>Turns</b> in the tool controls bar. 
This will not change the spiral’sdiameter.
If you ever feel lost when working with the spiral tool, you can use therightmost icon in the tool controls bar to remove all changes and toreset the spiral to its initial shape.

<kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >F4</kbd> or <kbd >x</kbd>
The <strong>3D-Box</strong> tool draws a (simulated) three-dimensional box. 
Tounderstand how it works, it helps to know a little bit about drawing inperspective. 
This tool is of interest to people who want to drawarchitecture or interiors. 
It makes it really easy to create furnitureor rooms, because it automatically creates perspective, by making use ofvanishing points.
After click-and-dragging with the tool active, a box appears on thecanvas. 
This is best done somewhere near the center of the page area.Otherwise, the box can sometimes end up quite deformed. 
By default, twovanishing points are placed in the vertical middle of the page borders,one on the right, the other on the left.
When you look closely at the 3D-box that you have drawn, you will seethe following:
A small <strong>black crosshair</strong>, which designates the center of the box.When you click and drag it with your mouse, the box will move alongwith it, apparently in 3D space. 
Depending on its position inrelation to the vanishing points, you will be able to see the box’sbottom, or its top. 
If you move the box to the left or right, itsshape will change in accordance with the vanishing lines.
Numerous (to be exact, 8) <strong>white, diamond-shaped handles</strong> allow youto extend or shrink the box along the x, y or z axis by dragging themwith the mouse.
The <strong>white, square-shaped handles</strong> symbolize the vanishing pointsand can be moved in the same fashion as the other handles.

Note that these specific changes can only be achieved when you use the3D-box tool. 
If you move the box with the Selection tool, both the boxand the vanishing points will move.
The tool controls for this tool allow you to set parameters for the 3vanishing points for the x, y and z axis. 
The buttons with the icon depicting twoparallel lines 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/toggle_vp_y.svg">
will make the vanishinglines parallel and have an immediate effect on the box on the canvas.

<h2><span class="orange">Stacking Order</span></h2>
If you have drawn objects that overlap each other, you can select an object and then click “Raise” or “Lower” under the “Object” menu to change the stacking order.

<h2><span class="orange">Free Drawing</span></h2>
The freehand drawing tools make it possible to draw directly onto the Inkscape canvas using the mouse or a graphics tablet stylus. 
Depending on what and how you would like to draw, you can select the best tool for the task. 
These tools are not based on geometrical shapes. 
You can draw exactly the shape you need. 
With some practice, you will get better and better in achieving exactly the result that you desire. 
And of course, you can always modify the elements in your drawing with the path tools.
In this section, we’re going to first learn about how to use the <strong>Pencil, Pen and Calligraphy tools</strong>. 
This way, we will gently learn about the new concept of : <b>paths</b>, which are at the core of vector drawings. 
Later on, we will explore how to edit these paths.

<h2><span class="orange">The Pencil Tool</span></h2>
<a href="_images/pencil_tool_icon.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pencil_tool_icon.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;"></a> <kbd >F6</kbd> or <kbd >P</kbd>
The behavior of the Pencil tool depends on the settings in its controlsbar. 
To draw with this tool, press the left mouse button and drag themouse around the canvas. 
The Pencil will leave a green trace thatfollows the location of the mouse cursor. 
When you let go of the mousebutton, the shape you created will get its stroke (and/or its fill, ifyou have one set).
Two tiny, square handles appear at the start and end of the drawn path.When you start drawing on one of these handles, this will continue thepath, instead of creating a new object.  And if you stop drawing thesame path in one of those squares, it will close the path (meaning thereare no openings).
Let’s have a look at the options of the Pencil tool. 
The <b>Shape</b>dropdown menu offers different brushes that influence the shape of the path:
<dl ><dt>Triangle in and out</dt><dd>This makes the path look a little more elegant, thinning or thickening alongits length. 
Switch to the Node tool and drag on the pink diamond-shaped handleto adjust the width interactively.</dd><dt>Ellipse</dt><dd>The beginning and end of the path will be thinner than its middle part.Switch to the Node tool and drag on the round white handle to adjustthe width interactively.</dd><dt>From clipboard</dt><dd>You can make custom brushes by first drawing yourbrush shape, and then copying it. 
This will add it to the clipboardautomatically and can be used as a brush for the pencil and pentools.</dd><dt>Bend from clipboard</dt><dd>First you must copy a curve that already exists. 
The line that you draw willbe deformed like the path that you copied. And it will be adjustable, usingthe Node tool.</dd><dt>Last applied</dt><dd>Use the same shape you used last time. 
Use this if you want to continue usinga custom shape, for drawing multiple lines with the same style. 
This way, youcan go back to using the clipboard normally. 
It does no longer have to holdthe shape you want to draw.</dd><dt>None</dt><dd>The drawn path’s outline will be of the same width along the whole length ofthe path.</dd></dl>
You can set the amount of <b>Smoothing</b> for the path you want to draw.When you use a mouse for drawing, making this value larger will make the linelook less scrawly. 
When you use a graphics tablet with pen, you can use a lowersmoothing value, and it will still look nice.
<a href="_images/lpe_based_simplification.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/lpe_based_simplification.png" style="width: 122px; height: 66px;"></a>
The button <b>LPE based interactive simplify</b> allows you to draw a pathwhere you can adjust the smoothing after you have finished drawing thepath. 
Use the button <b>LPE simplify flatten</b> to lock the result of theinteractive smoothing. 
After it has been used, the path’s smoothing canno longer be adjusted.
Hint
‘LPE’ is the acronym for “Live Path Effect”, a set offunctionalities specific to Inkscape that can change pathsnon-destructively, to achieve spectacular results.
To reset your changes to smoothing to the default value, you can use thebutton where the hover text says <b>reset pencil parameters to default</b>.
The pencil tool has three different <strong>modes</strong>. 
The results you get alsodepend a lot on the level of smoothing:
<dl ><dt>Create regular Bézier path</dt><dd>The path that you get as a result is very close to the path that you drag with the mouse cursor on the canvas. 
Remember to adjust the smoothing, to make your line look more elegant.</dd><dt>Create Spiro path</dt><dd>Create stylish swirls and curls with only the mouse!</dd><dt>Create BSpline path</dt><dd>This mode reveals its use when you switch tothe Node tool. 
It makes it really easy to draw evenly smooth curves.</dd></dl>
The Pencil tool (as well as the Pen tool) creates <strong>dots</strong> when you holddown <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> while clicking on the canvas. 
When you hold down both<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Shift</kbd>, the dots’ size will be doubled. 
With <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> +<kbd >Alt</kbd>, random sized small dots will be created with every click, and with<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Alt</kbd> + <kbd >Shift</kbd>, each click will generate a random sizedbig dot.
Hint
Note that the dots are really circles.

The same path as above, only wider. 
The width of a path that usesobjects on the clipboard (and those that use ‘Shape: Ellipse’, both usethe ‘Pattern along Path’ Live Path Effect) can be changed with the Nodetool, using the white circular handle at the beginning of the path.

The width of a path with a PowerStroke Live Path Effect (used by ‘Shape:Triangle In / Out’) can be adjusted with the node tool by moving a pink,diamond-shaped node, to achieve a non-constant path width.

<h2><span class="orange">The Pen Tool</span></h2>
<a href="_images/pen_tool_icon.png">

When you’re first using this tool, it may appear complex, but very soonit will become a good friend that you will enjoy to use for creatingyour illustrations.
This tool’s purpose is to draw paths. 
Multiple paths, drawn next to andon top of each other, form a design. 
For a start:
Click with the left mouse button to create the first point(node) of the path.
Move the mouse and click again. 
Repeat this for as many nodes thatyou want to draw. 
All your nodes will be connected by straight lines(segments).
To finish the path, right-click with the mouse.


It’s also possible to draw curves with this tool. 
Every node you createhas two handles. 
These handles define the shape of the curve. 
To draw acurve directly, you can:
Click with the left mouse button to position the first node.
Keep the mouse button pressed and move the mouse slightly.
You are currently moving one handle of the node.
Left-click and drag to continue the path, or right-click to finishit.


The first method is predestined for creating precise drawings. 
First,you position the nodes, later, you can use the node tool to modify thepath.
You’ll be able to choose from several modes: Bézier, Spiro, BSpline,straight lines, paraxial (= only strictly parallel and perpendicular).Then, there is the <b>Shape</b> option that you have alreadylearnt about in the chapter about the <a href="pencil-tool.html"><b>Pencil tool</b></a>.
With some experience, you will learn how to place your nodesstrategically. 
When a path contains too many nodes, this will makeworking with it more difficult. 
On the other hand, when there aren’t enough ofthem, you will find that you have a lack of control when you are tweaking thepath.

<b>Every left-click adds a node.

What a goose quill was in antiquity, is Inkscape’s calligraphy tool inthe digital world. 
Ideally, it should be used with a graphics tablet andstylus, with one hand on the graphics tablet and the other one on thekeyboard, which moves the canvas, so one can write without interruption.

<h2><span class="orange">Editing Paths with the Node Tool</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/tool-node-editor.svg">
<kbd >F2</kbd> or <kbd >N</kbd>
The second-most used tool in Inkscape is the <strong>Node tool</strong>. 
It will be your friend when you need to <strong>edit a path</strong>.
What you need to know about paths
Every path consists of nodes that are connected to each other, like pearls on a string. 
The ends of this string can be connected like in a chain (closed path), or there can be two end nodes, that are only connected to one other node (open path).
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/paths_open_and_closed.png">
<b>On the left side, there is an open path. 
On the right side, it has been closed by connecting the two end nodes.</b>
Each node can only be connected to one or two other nodes. 
It’s impossible to attach a third line to a node. 
When you need to draw a branching, you must create a separate path for one of the branches.
In Inkscape, a node’s position is marked by a square, circle or diamondhandle on the line that represents the path.
A path’s shape can be changed radically by moving the nodes it consistsof:
Activate the Node tool.
Click on the path to select it.
Click and drag the node you wish to reposition.

<b>This node has an incoming and an outgoing path segment connected to it.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node_tool_move_node.png">
<b>You can move a node by grabbing it with the mouse.</b>
For more gradual changes, paths can be edited by their nodes’handles. 
Each node can have up to two circular handles that are connected toit by thin lines. 
These handles can be moved around with the mouse, too. 
The handles control the shape of the adjacent path segment.
Activate the Node tool.
Click on the path to select it.
Click on the node you wish to edit.
Click and drag on the node’s handle(s).


<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node_tool_shaping_segments.png">
<b>You can modify path segments by moving the node’s handles.</b>
You can also manipulate the lines between the nodes (the path segments) directly,using the Node tool. 
Click and drag on the path segment that connects two nodes,to change its curvature, without having to use the handles for this.

The Node tool offers a number of options we haven’t seen yet. 
In thischapter we will go through them, by looking at the different icons inits tool controls bar:
<dl ><dt>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node-add.svg">
Insert new node</dt><dd>A double-click on a path segment lets you add new nodes easily directly on thecanvas. 
If you need to add more nodes, or want to insert a node right in themiddle between two other nodes, you can click on the path segment or selectmultiple nodes, then use this button. 
More nodes allow you to moreprecisely determine the shape of a path.</dd><dt>

You have probably noticed that the node handles don’t all look the same. 
Inkscape has a number of different node types, that each behave in a specific way:
<dl ><dt>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node-type-cusp.svg">
Cusp nodes</dt><dd>Used for creating corners, or for being able to freely modify the curvature ofthe path. 
The handles can be moved independantly. 
A cusp node isdiamond-shaped.</dd><dt>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node-type-smooth.svg">
Smooth nodes</dt><dd>Used for drawing beautiful, flowing curves. 
Both handles and the node arealigned on a straight line. 
Smooth nodes look like ordinary squares.</dd><dt>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node-type-symmetric.svg">
Symmetric nodes</dt><dd>Used for drawing soft curves. 
The handles are not only on the same line, butalso both at the same distance from the node. 
Symmetric nodes look like squares, too, but their handles always move together.</dd><dt>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/node-type-auto-smooth.svg">
Auto-smooth nodes</dt><dd>Used for drawing nicecurves, without worrying about handles or segment shapes. 
The handlessit on a straight line, and their distance from the node adaptsautomatically when you move the node, so a smooth curve is drawn. 
A smooth node has a circular shape.</dd></dl>
To change a node’s type:
Switch to the <strong>Node tool</strong> by clicking on its icon.
Click on the path you want to modify.
Click on the node that you would like to convert to a differentnode type, or select multiple nodes.
Then click on the corresponding icon in the tool controls bar toset the node type.


Beginners often prefer to use cusp nodes, because they are easy to use,although very often, smooth nodes would be the better choice.

<h2><span class="orange">Editing Nodes on a Geometrical Shape</span></h2>
There are multiple ways to modify an object in your drawing. 
If the object is arectangle, an ellipse, a star or a spiral, i.e. 
a geometrical shape drawn withone of the shape tools, then this object is a <strong>shape</strong>, and not a <strong>path</strong>.
Shapes can only be modified by dragging their specific handles. 
In contrast toshapes, you will edit a path with tools that are meant for modifying paths.
However, <strong>shapes can be converted into paths</strong>, so the path tools can then beused with them.
To convert a shape into a path:
Select the shape with the Selector tool.
In the menu, select <b>Path : Object to path</b>.

Warning
A shape can always be converted to a path, but a path can neverbe converted back into an object!

<h2><span class="orange">The Tweak Tool</span></h2>

<kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >F2</kbd> or <kbd >w</kbd>
The Tweak tool is the ideal tool for illustrators who first draw their designs onpaper, then scan and vectorize their work. 
With it, you can modify pathson the canvas, using numerous options, without everswitching tools.
As the tool only works on <strong>selected objects</strong>, first select the path that you would like to modify. 
Then switch to the <strong>Tweak tool</strong> and <strong>click</strong> on the area that you wish to edit, or <strong>click and drag</strong> the tool over the canvas.
First, let’s have a look at its general options:

<h2><span class="orange">Colors</span></h2>
Colors of objects can be added and changed at any time when you’re working with Inkscape.
For a vector object, a separate style can be defined for its outline (or<strong>stroke</strong>) and its main color (or <strong>fill</strong>). 
This can be a <strong>plain color</strong>(e.g. 
dark red), a <strong>pattern</strong> (e.g. 
stripes or flowers), or a <strong>gradient</strong>(e.g. 
a smooth transition from green to blue).
Inkscape comes with a couple of patterns, but also makes it easy to create yourown <strong>custom patterns</strong>. 
Adding a plain color—that is, a uniform color—caneasily be achieved by using one of the ready-made palettes. 
Gradients arecreated directly on the canvas with a dedicated tool.
In this section, we are going to learn how to apply a plain color in variousways, how to create custom gradients and how to use stock patterns and createour own custom patterns. 
We will also learn how to modify the stroke style (e.g.make it dashed) and how to use markers.

<h2><span class="orange">The Color Palette</span></h2>
At the bottom of the Inkscape window, you can find the <strong>color palette</strong>.
The quickest way to apply a color to an object is to:
Select the object with the <strong>Selector tool</strong>.
<strong>Left-click</strong> on the color of your choice in the palette.
The color will be immediately applied to your object.


You can also click-and-drag the color on your object to use that colorfor your object.
Each vector object can have a stroke color and a fill color. 
To apply acolor to the stroke:
Select the object with the <strong>Selector tool</strong>.
Hold down <kbd >Shift</kbd> and <strong>left-click</strong> on the color field ofyour choice.
The color will immediately be applied to the object’s stroke.


If you do not like the colors offered by the current palette, you canuse one of the other palettes Inkscape supplies. 
To switch the palette:
Click on the <strong>tiny triangle</strong> to the right of the palette, nearthe margin of the Inkscape window.
Click on the name of another palette.


You will also notice that there are options for changing the palette’sappearance at the top of the palette menu, which allow you to makethe palette more or less tightly arranged.
Tip
<strong>Custom palettes</strong>
It’s also possible to create your own color palette. 
To do so, createan empty text file with the file extension <code><b>.gpl</b></code>, which contains thename of the palette in the first line, and your colors in RGB hexadecimalformat, each in a separate line. 
Save this file in the folder<code><b>/palettes</b></code>, which you create in the folder indicated at<b>Edit : Preferences : System: User config</b>.
Restart Inkscape to see the new palette in the list.

<h2><span class="orange">The Fill And Stroke Dialog</span></h2>
This dialog can be opened in various ways:
menu <b>Object : Fill and Stroke</b>
keyboard shortcut <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >F</kbd>
via its icon <a href="_images/fill_and_stroke_icon.png">

or by double-clicking on the fields for fill and stroke at the bottomleft of the Inkscape window.

The dialog has 3 tabs: one for the <b>fill</b>, one for the <b>stroke paint</b> andone for the <b>stroke style</b>. 
The first row of buttons in the tabs for fill and stroke paint are for setting the type of fill or stroke paint thatyou want to use:

Below, you can customize your color - we will return to that in the nextchapter. 
At the bottom of all 3 tabs, there are two fields that setvalues for the whole object:
<b>Blur</b>: when you click, or click-and-drag in this field, you canapply a blur to the whole selected object. 
Be warned: in most cases,values greater than 2% are pretty useless.
<b>Opacity</b>: when you click, or click-and-drag in this field, thiswill change the global opacity of the selected object - changing theopacity of fill and stroke equally.

When the palette does not contain the color you would like to use, you canselect a color in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog. 
We will now take acloser look at that dialog.
At the top of the dialog, there are 3 different tabs: for the <b>Fill</b>,the <b>Stroke paint</b>, and the <b>Stroke style</b>.
In both the <b>Fill</b> and the <b>Stroke paint</b> tabs, you will find5 different color selection modes: <b>RGB</b> (Red, Green, Blue),<b>HSL</b> (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), <b>CMYK</b> (Cyan, Magenta,Yellow, Key/Black), <b>Wheel</b> (Colorwheel) and <b>CMS</b> (ColorManagement System).
This book will not go into the details of the differences between these modes. 
Many people find the <b>HSL</b> color selector the easiest to use. 
The <b>CMS</b> color selector is reserved for advanced uses, and only makes sense in combination with the open source desktop publishing software <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> .
For choosing a color for your first drawings, you can select any of the firstfour options.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/color_selectors.png">
<b>The same light blue color in four different color selectors.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/blue_mountains.png">
<b>Our mountains are light blue at the beginning.</b>
To select your color, click or click-and-drag with the mouse in the differentsliders (or the wheel). 
Always remember to first select your object! The resultwill immediately be displayed on the canvas. 
When you’re happy with it, don’ttouch anything in the dialog!
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/green_mountains.png">
<b>But we prefer them green.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/green_mountains_green_stroke.png">
<b>And we choose a green stroke.</b>
Every color chooser also has a field labelled <b>A</b> at the bottom. 
‘A’ stands for ‘Alpha’, which is the opacity value of the selected color. 
The higher the value for alpha, the more opaque your color will be.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/green_mountains_low_alpha.png">
<b>If we lower the alpha value for the fill, we can see that the sun is about to rise behind our green mountains. 
Note that the stroke is still completely opaque.</b>
In case you were wondering about that little field labelled <b>RGBA</b> in the bottom right corner of the dialog: it is the name of the color in : <b>opacity</b> or ‘alpha value’ (just like the slider labeled <b>A</b>).

<h2><span class="orange">Copying a color</span></h2>
There are several ways to apply the same style to multiple objects:
<strong>Selecting multiple objects</strong>: select all the objects whose coloryou want to change (hold <kbd >Shift</kbd> and click, or drag a selectionbox around them), then open the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog, select a color. 
It will be applied to all selected objects automatically.
<strong>Use the Dropper tool</strong>: select an object, then activate the Droppertool by clicking on its icon 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/color-picker.svg">, then click on the canvas, on an area where it has the color that you want to apply. 
The selected object’s color will change accordingly.
<strong>Copy the complete style of an object to apply it toanother object:</strong> select the object, copy it to the clipboard with <kbd >Ctrl</kbd>+ <kbd >C</kbd>, then select the second object and paste only the style with<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >V</kbd>. 
This not only copies the fill andstroke color, but also the stroke width and style, a text’s font style and anypatterns or gradients.

<h2><span class="orange">Creating Gradients</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/color-gradient.svg">
<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >F1</kbd> or <kbd >G</kbd>
Inkscape allows you to comfortably create and modify gradients on-canvas.However, it is useful to always have the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialogwithin reach, so you can modify the colors easily.
The <strong>Gradient Tool</strong> can be activated in the tool bar. 
To apply a gradient to anobject, you need to first select an object. 
Then, click-and-drag over the objectwith the Gradient tool.
There will now appear two new handles on the object, one square, one circular,which are connected by a blue line. 
The square symbolizes the beginning of thegradient, and the circle its end.
By default, the tool creates linear gradients with two stops (i.e. 
2 handles withone color each). 
The color of the start stop is opaque, the color of the end stopis entirely transparent. 
This way, your object will look as if it is fading out.
To change a gradient’s direction and position, just move the square or thecircular handle with the mouse.
To edit a gradient’s colors:
select one handle of the gradient (circular or square) with the Gradient tool
in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog, select the color you want, or clickon a color in the palette to assign it to the selected gradient stop.


To create a gradient that has more than 2 colors, you can double-click with theGradient tool on the blue line that spans between the handles. 
This will createa new, diamond-shaped handle. 
You can now change its color. 
The result willimmediately show on the canvas. 
When you move the diamond-shaped handle along theline with the mouse, the colors of the gradient will move, too.
You can transform a linear gradient into a radial one by using the top rowbutton 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/paint-gradient-radial.svg">
in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog. 
You canalso replace the old gradient by creating a new one with the Gradienttool. 
For this, the button for radial gradients in the tool controls bar must beselected.
When an object has a <strong>radial gradient</strong> applied to it, the gradient issymbolized not by a straight line, but by an angle, that has a square handle inthe middle, and two circular handles at the end of its arms. 
The length of thearms represents the diameter of the radial gradient.
There can be separate gradients applied to an object’s fill and to its stroke.

<h2><span class="orange">Creating a Mesh Gradient</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/mesh-gradient.svg">
This tool is especially useful for those who want to create photorealisticdesigns, but it also has its uses for everyone who wants to create complexgradients in a single object.
To apply a mesh gradient to an object, select the object.
Now you have two options:
<dl ><dt>Option 1:</dt><dd>Activate the Mesh Gradient tool in the tool bar. 
Use it to click and drag onthe object.</dd><dt>Option 2:</dt><dd>Open the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog. 
There, select the <strong>MeshGradient</strong> mode 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/paint-gradient-mesh.svg">.</dd></dl>
Now, the mesh gradient will be displayed directly on the object. 
It has somedifferent kinds of nodes:
grey diamond-shaped nodes for assigning colors
white circular (or arrow-shaped) handles for shaping the mesh
Note
You will only be able to see and modify these nodes when you use the MeshGradient tool.
In the tool’s tool controls bar, note the fields labelled <b>Rows</b> and<b>Columns</b>. 
More rows or columns add more nodes that can each have aseparate color. 
This way, an object can be painted in a multitude ofcolors. 
New meshes will have the set number of rows or columns.
To add more rows or columns to an existing gradient, double-click on thevertical or horizontal mesh lines.
To apply a color:
select a grey node
select the color of your choice.

Tip
You can use the dropper icon 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/color-picker.svg">
at the bottom of the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog to more quickly apply colors that you already use in your drawing.
Just like the normal gradients, <strong>mesh gradients</strong> can be shared betweenobjects, when both objects use a gradient with the same name (e.g.mygradient1234). 
Select the gradient in the <b>Mesh Fill</b> list inthe <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog to reuse it on a different object.

<h2><span class="orange">Using Patterns</span></h2>
Inkscape comes with a couple of preset patterns. 
To apply them to anobject, you need to:
select the object on the canvas
open the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog, and in the <b>Fill</b> (or<b>Stroke paint</b>) tab, click on the icon for patterns 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/paint_pattern_icon.png">

You will then see a dropdown menu with many pattern names. 
Select any patternfrom the list to apply it immediately to the object.


<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pattern_polka_dots_medium_with_pattern_list.png">
<b>Object with stock pattern ‘Polka dots, medium’ and a view of thelist of available patterns</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Modifying Patterns</span></h2>
A pattern can easily be rotated, enlarged or shrunk. 
When the node toolis active, an interesting trio will appear in the top left corner:
a <strong>cross</strong>, which you can use to move the pattern
a <strong>white, circular handle</strong> that allows you to rotate the pattern.
a <strong>white, square-shaped handle</strong>, which enlarges and shrinks thepattern.

When you grab these handles with the mouse and drag them, they willaffect the pattern, and the result will immediately be visible.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pattern02.png">
<b>Standard pattern with vertical stripes.</b>

<b>The pattern has been rotated, using the circular handle.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pattern04.png">
<b>The pattern has been enlarged, by dragging the square handle.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Creating Custom Patterns</span></h2>
You can make your own patterns in Inkscape. 
A pattern can consist of a texture(i.e. 
a raster image like *.jpg or *.png that you imported), a group, a path,shape objects, …
Select the object that you would like use as a pattern, and then tell thesoftware to turn it into a pattern via <b>Object : Pattern :Objects to Pattern</b>. 
Your pattern will appear on the canvas, applied to arectangle. 
It will now also be available in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b>dialog, next to the stock patterns that come with Inkscape.
The <b>Pattern to Objects</b> option in the same menu allows you to do theopposite operation. 
This is useful when you want to modify a pattern, or want toextract an object from it.
Your first patterns may look a little surprising to you. 
When you startdesigning beautiful seamless patterns, you are engaging in the art ofillustration.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/custom_pattern.png">
<b>This octopus image is using a custom fish pattern.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Strokes</span></h2>
An object’s stroke is handled independently from its fill. 
Two of thetabs of the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog are dedicated to styling strokes.
You can assign a paint to a stroke. 
This works in the same way as assigning apaint to the fill does (but in the Stroke tab). 
The stroke paint can not only bea flat color, but also a radial or linear gradient, a pattern or even a gradientmesh.
In the <b>Stroke Style</b> tab, you can set the width of the stroke, theshape of its : <b>end caps</b> or select a dashpattern (simple stroke, various dash lengths,…).
Check the zoom level (in %) in the bottom right corner of the window to be surethat you’re applying a suitable width. 
The more you zoom in, the wider thestroke will appear.
The options for <b>Join</b> and <b>Cap</b> slightly modify the shapeof the stroke. 
The default values are fully sufficient in most cases.
The <b>Dashes</b> dropdown list gives access to a large selection ofdifferent dash styles, that give you regular dash patterns along the stroke. 
Thenumber field to the right allows you to shift the dash pattern to the desiredlocation.
It is impossible to apply blur only to an object’s stroke. 
The options for<b>Blur</b> and <b>Opacity</b> always apply to the object as a whole.

<h2><span class="orange">Markers</span></h2>
Markers are little symbols that can be added to the start of a path, to itsend, and to the line in between those. 
They will be placed on the path’sstroke. 
This is very useful when you want to create arrows and diagramsquickly!
Markers will be located exactly on the nodes of the path. 
The startmarker will appear on the first node of the path, the middle markers oneach node along the path, and the end marker on the last node of thepath.
Inkscape offers lots of different markers for you to choose from. 
Youcan look at them in the <b>Stroke Style</b> tab of the <b>Filland Stroke</b> dialog, in the row labelled <b>Markers</b>. 
The left-mostdrop-down menu is for the start marker, the one in the middle for the middlemarkers, and the right-most one for the end markers.
Markers automatically take on the fill and stroke of the path they areattached to. 
In older Inkscape versions, the extension<b>Extensions : Modify Path : Color Markers</b> will do thisfor you.
If your arrows point into the wrong direction, you can change thedirection of the path (<b>Path : Reverse</b>).

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/illu-marqueur1.png">

List of available markers.. 
(TODO: insert image)

<h2><span class="orange">Ordering Markers, Stroke and Fill</span></h2>
An object’s path determines its shape. 
The : <b>stroke</b> is centered onthe path, one half of it on the inside of the path, overlapping with thefill, the other half is on the outside. 
Markers, too, are centered on thepath.
In the <b>Order</b> section of the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog, youcan select the order in which these different parts of an object will be drawn.This way, you can place markers (and / or strokes) above or below the fill.

<h2><span class="orange">Creating Custom Markers</span></h2>
Just as you can create custom patterns, you can also create your own custommarkers. 
In order to do so, draw the marker you’re envisioning, then make itavailable for use by doing <b>Object : Object to markers</b>.
Your marker is now available at the top of the list of markers in the drop-downmenu (<b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog, third tab).
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/custom_markers_step1.png">
<b>We have drawn our markers and our path.

It also changes with the stroke width of the path.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Text in Inkscape</span></h2>
There is one menu which is dedicated to everything related to <strong>Text</strong>, which makes it easier to add text to adverts or logos. 
The text can be added as a normal text, or in a frame for a : <b>auto-wrapped text</b>.
At any time, the font, font size and color of the text can be changed. 
You can also make interesting modifications such as making a text follow the course of a path or flowing it into an irregularly-shaped frame.
Once a text has been converted to a path, the text can be deformed just like any other path, to achieve a specific visual design or typography.
Typographers will appreciate the option to create : <b>SVG fonts</b> with Inkscape. 
The dedicated dialog allows you to directly see the result, in a preview that updates as you type!

<h2><span class="orange">Writing Text</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/outil-texte.png">
<kbd >F8</kbd> or <kbd >T</kbd>
Once the Text tool is active, you will have two options at your handsabout how to create a text.
When you want to add a text that consists only of a single word or a short expression, the easiest way to add it is to:
Left-click on the canvas to place the cursor at the desired position.
Type the text directly afterwards. 
The text will all be put into asingle line, unless you hit <kbd >Enter</kbd> to continue in the next line.


When you want to put your (longer) text into a specific areathat you have reserved for it:
Click-and-drag on the canvas. 
This will create a frame for a flowedtext with a blue border, in which the text can be inserted.
Type on the keyboard. 
The text will appear in its frame and will notleave the frame area. 
When it reaches the border of the frame, itwill automatically flow into the next line. 
The border of the textframe will turn red when the text doesn’t completely fit into it.
You can change the dimensions of the text box by dragging on thewhite handle in the bottom right corner.

Note
The text will not stretch or grow to fill the allotted space at allcosts. 
It is up to you to adapt the size of the area or the font to yourneeds.

<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >T</kbd>, <b>Text : Text and Font</b>
The <b>Text and Font</b> dialog is ideal for modifying a text’s style. 
Most of the options that are available in that dialog can also be found in the horizontal tool controls bar at the top of the canvas:
TODO: list options for dialog and toolbar separately, this mixup is confusing. 
Adjust to 0.92.3 changes (how to explain those messed up line height settings???)
a field with a list of the fonts that are installed on yourcomputer
the font style (bold, italic, condensed, regular etc.)
the font size
the line-height or spacing between lines
the icons for the text alignment (left, right, centered)
two icons for quickly adding superscript or subscript
a field for setting the spacing between letters and one for thespacing between words
two fields for horizontally and vertically shifting single orselected letters (kerning) and one for rotating them
icons for changing the text’s direction and orientation.

In the dialog, you will see a small preview of the result of yoursettings, and a tab labelled <b>Text</b> that can hold the whole text withoutdisplaying any styling. 
Once you have all parameters tweaked to yourliking, you can click on <b>Apply</b> to make the result show up on thecanvas.
Inkscape does not come with any fonts. 
It will allow you to select fromthose that you have installed on your system. 
When you install a newfont while you are working on a drawing, you need to close all Inkscapewindows and restart the program to be able to select the new font.
The tab <b>Variants</b> allows you to activate specific features of certainfonts, like : <b>ligatures</b>.
There are several options that influence the text’s orientation. 
Inkscapeoffers support for vertical scripts, and also for text that is written from right to left, like Arabic or Hebrew. 
If your screen isn’t wide enough to display the whole list of option buttons for the Text tool, you will see a little arrow on the far right of the tool controls bar.

You can change a text’s color the same way as you change the color of any vectorobject in Inkscape. 
First, you need to select the text, or, using the Text tool,you can even select words or characters in a text, then you click on the colorof your choice. 
The text can have a separate paint for fill and stroke, like allthe objects in Inkscape. 
You can also apply a gradient to a text.

<b>Text variations</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Moving and Rotating Letters</span></h2>
Aside from deforming a text with the <b>Selector</b> tool, Inkscape offers numerous options to have fun with texts, adapting them to the design,while keeping them editable.
To use the following options you need to select the text, words, orletters you want to move with the text tool, and then increase ordecrease the value of the option in the tool controls bar (the defaultvalue for all of them is 0). 
The change will immediately be visible onthe canvas.
<h2>Options for moving and rotating letters</h2>
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Changing spacing between letters</h3>
The option allows you to change the distances between all letters in theselected text, or the selected letters. 
This is useful if your font size is very small, because it improves readability.
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Changing spacing between words</h3>
Here you can change the distances between all words in your text, or theselected part of the text.
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Changing horizontal kerning</h3>
The option changes the distance between the two letters in the position ofthe cursor. 
All letters that come after will move by the value you indicatein the input field.
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Changing vertical kerning</h3>
One of the options is for changing the position of a word or single lettersin relation to the base line. 
This means that the selected word or letterwill be moved up or down, and will no longer rest on the same line as itsfellows.
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Changing letter rotation</h3>
One last option allows you to also rotate single letters (or all selectedletters).
If your design requires a more radical change of the shape of the text,it is possible to make a text follow a path or to put it into anarbitrarily shaped frame.

<em>Adjusting the height to achieve typographical effects.</em>
Text with exaggerated kerning and rotation.

<h2><span class="orange">Putting Text on a Path</span></h2>
The adjustment of letters’ and words’ positions are merely the finishingtouch. 
More often, it is useful to start out by layouting the text as awhole in a drawing. 
Inkscape offers two options for this, which areaccessible via <b>Text : Put on Path</b> and <b>Text : Flow into Frame</b>.
<a href="_images/icon-texte-chemin.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/icon-texte-chemin.png" style="width: 30px; height: 30px;"></a>
To make a text that follows a path’s curvature, you need to do this:
Create a path that will serve as the base line for the words andletters of the text. 
The path can be created by using the shapetools and combining shapes with the Boolean operations, or bydrawing it directly with one of the tools that draw paths.
Write the text directly on the canvas, after clicking on it withthe mouse. 
It’s not useful to use flowed text in a frame for this.
With the Selector tool, select the path and the text. 
Then makeInkscape do the work by selecting <b>Text : Put onPath</b> from the menu.


The result will show up on the canvas immediately. 
The text can still beedited at any time: you can change its contents or style whenever youlike. 
The path will remain editable, too: you can shape its curves, addor delete nodes, move it, etc. 
and the text will automatically adjustto its changed shape.
Very often, this path only serves to position the text. 
If you deleteit, the text doesn’t have anything to follow anymore, and reverts to itsprevious shape. 
If you don’t want to see the path in your drawing,remove its fill and its stroke!
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/illu_texte5_A.png">
<b>Create a text and a path by whichever method you prefer…</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/illu_texte5_B.png">
<b>… and put the text on the path using <b>Text : Put on Path</b>.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Flowing Text into a Frame</span></h2>
Whether you’re creating a graphical poem (calligram), or whether yourtext needs a specific shape to fit into your layout, Inkscape offers youa tool to assist with this type of design.
<a href="_images/icon-texte-encadre.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/icon-texte-encadre.png" style="width: 30px; height: 30px;"></a>
To use it:
Write the text on the canvas (or copy-paste it).
Create the path or shape that the text is supposed to fill.
With the Selector tool, select the shape and the text, then use<b>Text : Flow into Frame</b>.


The path stays editable, the text will try to fill it as good aspossible. 
The text, too, can still be edited any time.
Very often, this is just the first step in arranging a text in adecorative fashion. 
Some finishing touches may be needed to improve thepositioning of certain words or letters, by using the options offered bythe Text tool.
To further tweak the text, there is one last, <strong>irreversible</strong> option: thetransformation of a text into a path. 
When you convert a text into apath, you will lose any possibility of editing the text’s contents. 
Thetext will no longer be available as a text object, but it now allows youto use all the available options for editing paths. 
For example, it willbecome impossible to change the font, the font weight (light, bold,heavy,…) or the style (italic, regular, condensed,…). 
Because ofthis, it is recommended to work on the rough and general shape of a textfirst, and to later move on to the finer details:
Finish everything that needs to be done with the Text tool, tobenefit from the tool’s property of keeping the text itself editable.
Only convert the text to a path at the very end, to be able to tweakthe small details of the text.

If you would like to share the SVG file on the web, or to export it intoa PDF file, that you want to share with other people, convert all textobjects to paths. 
Not all computers have the same fonts installed, andthe file may look very different to someone, if their computer uses afallback font to display the text.

<h2><span class="orange">Creating Custom Fonts</span></h2>
Fonts can be saved in different file formats: OTF, TTF and SVG (and some more).
With Inkscape, you can create SVG fonts. 
These fonts can later be converted toanother font file format, and be used in a text editor or graphics program. 
Thereare also a few programs that support SVG fonts directly (Inkscape 0.92.x is notone of them. 
This is planned for version 1.0, though).
The letters, numbers and special characters a font consists of are called: <b>glyphs</b>.
To create a custom SVG font:
Open the typography template with <b>File : New from Template : Typography Canvas</b>.
Open the <b>Font Editor</b> dialog from <b>Text : SVG Font Editor</b>.
In the column labelled <b>Font</b>, click on <b>New</b> to create a font. 
You can double-click on the generic name of the font to change it.
Open the <b>Layers</b> dialog from <b>Layer : Layers</b>.


Repeat the following for each glyph that you want to add to your font:
In the <b>Layers</b> dialog, add a new layer by clicking on the ‘+’ icon.Name it after your letter. 
Select the layer in the dialog.
Now, in the <b>Font Editor</b>, in the tab <b>Glyphs</b>, click on<b>Add Glyph</b>. 
Double-click on the <b>Glyph name</b> field toname your glyph, e.g. 
call it ‘Capital A’ or ‘Space’. 
In the<b>Matching String</b> field, enter the letter that it corresponds to.
Draw the path for your glyph on the canvas.
When you’re happy with your glyph, select it, and also select thecorresponding row in the dialog, then click on <b>Get curves fromselection</b>.

Tip
You can always test your font by typing a text into the field at the bottom ofthe <b>SVG Font Editor</b> dialog and looking at the preview above it.
Hint
You can use the little ‘eye’ icons in the <b>Layers</b> dialog to hide the layers with the glyphs that you have already finished. 
To protect the completed glyph layers from accidental changes, use the ‘lock’ icons.
When you are done, save the file as an Inkscape SVG (this is Inkscape’s standard file format).
Although this functionality is meant for typographers, amateurs, too, can quicklyget a working result and test their work as they go.
When your font is finished, you can use a software like <a href="https://fontforge.github.io/">FontForge</a> where you import your SVG font and can exportit into different formats to be able to use it with other software.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/font_editor.png">

<h2><span class="orange">Saving Your Work</span></h2>
Inkscape is stable software. 
However, some unfortunate actions can entail a crash. 
The best way to prevent this from causing problems is to regularly save your drawing. 
For this reason, the keyboard shortcut <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >S</kbd> should be used frequently. 
When you first save your drawing, give your file a name of your choice, and select one of these extensions:
<dl ><dt>.svg (Inkscape SVG)</dt><dd>to keep all the data in your file, even the data that is only useful forediting with Inkscape, and no other editor</dd><dt>.svg (Plain SVG)</dt><dd>for sharing your drawing with other people, who might not use Inkscape, but use SVG, e.g. 
when they view a web page that uses a picture that you created</dd><dt>.svgz (compressed Inkscape / Plain SVG)</dt><dd>compressed to save space on your harddisk</dd></dl><h2>Activating Autosave prevents loss of work</h2>
If Inkscape closes unexpectedly, in most cases, it creates a backup file, which is available in a location that will be indicated in a dialog window. 
The file name consists of the original file name with the time and date of the crash. 
It is recommended that (additionally to saving frequently) you activate Inkscape’s <b>Autosave</b> feature, which you can find in <b>Edit : Preferences : Input/Output : Autosave</b>.

<h2><span class="orange">Exporting a PNG file</span></h2>
Often, it’s useful to export your work into a raster graphics file format, toshow off or use it with other programs.
Open the dialog Export PNG Image with <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >E</kbd>, orby going to <b>File : Export PNG Image</b>. 
Now you will have acouple of different options for the export area:
<b>Page</b>: Export only the contents of the page area
<b>Drawing</b>: Export all objects that you have drawn on the canvas
<b>Selection</b>: Export only the area of the selected objects
<b>Custom</b>: Export according to the coordinates that you enter intothe fields at the top

Under the heading <b>Image Size</b>, indicate the size of your image inpixels, or the desired resolution. 
The other values will adapt automatically.Now select a name for the exported file and click on <b>Export</b>.
Beginners are sometimes surprised that their exported image has a transparentbackground. 
To change this, open <b>File : Document Properties</b>(<kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd>), then for a white background, set thealpha channel of the background color to 255 after a click on the<b>Background Color</b> field. 
Other colors can be selected for the exportbackground accordingly.
Inkscape exports your drawing without a margin. 
This can lead to the impressionthat the image is cut off, while it is not. 
If this bothers you, you can addmargins by using the collapsible field <b>Resize Page to Content</b> in thefirst tab of the <b>Document Properties</b> dialog. 
Note that this changesthe page size.

<h2><span class="orange">Exporting a PDF File</span></h2>
The PDF file format is a vector format that can also hold raster images.Inkscape can save directly to PDF. 
To do so, do <b>File : Save a Copy</b>,and select <b>Portable Document Format (*.pdf)</b> from the list of availablefile formats at the bottom.
Caution
Never save as PDF only, but always keep an SVG file, because thePDF file format supports a different set of features from the SVG file formatand you may lose data in the process.
A dialog will then allow you to set the following options:
<b>Restrict to PDF version</b>: Current choices are 1.4 or 1.5. 
If no specific version is required by the persons who will get the PDF file from you, you can leave it at the default 1.5.
<b>Text output options</b>: If your text needs to be searchable in the PDF and the font license allows you to embed the font, choose to <b>Embed fonts</b>. 
When the text is mostly decorative (as in a logo), it’s better to convert the text to paths. 
If you’re writing on a thesis or another scientific document, and know how to work with LaTeX, you can make use of the third option <b>Omit text in PDF and create LaTeX file</b>.
<b>Rasterize filter effects</b>: Blurs, shadows and any other filters cannot be used in PDF. 
This option tells Inkscape to make a ‘photo’ of any objects/areas in the drawing that have a filter. 
That way, the drawing will still look the same in a PDF. 
If you do not select this option, objects that are filtered will look different in the PDF.
<b>Resolution for rasterization (dpi)</b>: The higher the value, the more fine-grained the ‘photos’ of filtered objects will be. 
Common values are 96 dpi for screen display, and 300 or 600 dpi for printing.
<b>Output page size</b>: Lets you choose which part of the drawing to export to PDF.
<b>Bleed/margin</b>: Increases the size of the exported area by adding a margin of the selected width.
<b>Limit export to object with ID</b>: Only export the specified object.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pdf_export_dialog.png">
<b>The PDF export dialog offers many options. 
Usually, the default settings willwork fine. 
However, when the PDF is for printing (as opposed to screen display),it is recommended that you set the dpi value (resolution) for filtered objectsto at least 300.</b>
Tips
Inkscape can also open PDF files for editing. 
Try to avoid multiple round-tripsthrough different file formats, though, because each conversion loses data or addsunnecessary data.
Note that for creating perfect PDF files for printing, it’s better toturn to a dedicated desktop publishing software such as <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a>, which can also import SVG files.

<h2><span class="orange">Exporting to other File Formats</span></h2>
In addition to : <b>PNG</b>, Inkscape can export to a varietyof other file formats. 
A list of available formats in your own Inkscapeinstallation can be found at the bottom of the <b>File :Save</b>, <b>File : Save as</b> and <b>File : Save aCopy</b> dialogs.
Some formats only become available when a certain other program is installedon the computer. 
Third-party Inkscape extensions that you install yourselfcan also add new file formats to the list.
No matter which format you want to export to, it is recommended to only usethe <b>Save a Copy</b> functionality for this, and to save your originalfile as <b>Inkscape SVG</b>. 
This way, you can always come back and makeedits to your original drawing, and you will not lose helpful editor data,such as guides, grids, path effects, layers and more.
For some of these file formats, you will get a dialog promptingyou to select further options for export.
Note that most export file formats do not support all Inkscape features.

<h2><span class="orange">Importing Pictures into a Document</span></h2>
Sometimes, it can be necessary to use raster images in your drawing, beit for copying from a sketch you made, vectorizing a raster image, orfor adding a photo into your design. 
Depending on the purpose, a rasterimage can be linked to, or embedded. 
<strong>Linking</strong> to an image means thatInkscape loads the raster image from the place where it is stored intoInkscape everytime the file is opened. 
In consequence, if you move ordelete the raster image file or the SVG file, or share the file withsomeone else, the link between those two will break. 
Instead of theimage, you will see a red frame. 
So it is often safer to <strong>embed</strong> rasterimages into the SVG file instead. 
This will make the file larger, butyour drawing will not change due to moving your files around.
To import an image, use <b>File : Import</b>. 
In the dialog thatopens, you can select the file.
Then a dialog will ask you if you would like to link or embed the imagein question.
Don’t panic if you have selected the wrong option for embedding orlinking, you can change this any time. 
Select the image, right-click onit, and then either select <b>Extract Image</b> or <b>Embed Image</b>,to change to the other mode.
The imported image will be inserted at your mouse cursor’s position, or,if the mouse is not currently on the canvas, into the middle of thevisible area of your drawing.
Inkscape imports a huge variety of raster image file formats, but onlyexports to PNG. 
There exist extensions for Inkscape that allow to exportto JPG and other file formats.

<h2><span class="orange">Importing other File Formats</span></h2>
Inkscape can import and open a large variety of file formats. 
The availability of some import file formats depends on other programs installed on your computer. 
Third-party Inkscape extensions can be used to import additional file formats.
When you import certain file formats, Inkscape may open a dialog asking you to specify import options for the file.
For some file formats, Inkscape is only able to import a subset of all available features of that file format.

<h2><span class="orange">Overview</span></h2>
Now you have familiarized yourself with the basics of the Inkscape program. 
While Inkscape may appear complex when you first use it, with some practice, you will soon feel more confident.
In this chapter, you will discover functionality that can be used to automate or simplify many steps. 
However, don’t forget that originality comes from your imagination, and not from a software that autogenerates the results for you.
First, we will learn about some useful techniques, then we will get to see some interesting filters, extensions and path effects. 
Lastly, you will learn a little about customizing Inkscape.

<h2><span class="orange">Copying and Duplicating Objects</span></h2>
The famous <b>Copy</b> keyboard shortcut <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >C</kbd> also worksin Inkscape, but its brother <b>Duplicate</b>, with <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd>is very useful, too.
Copying with <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >C</kbd> copies the selected element into theclipboard. 
It can then be pasted into the document (or into another opendocument) by using the corresponding shortcut <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >V</kbd>. 
Thisinserts the object at the place of the cursor.
Duplicating, however, makes a copy of an object and positions this copy exactlyon top of the original. 
This can be very useful when your copy needs to be inthe same place as the original—you will not need to use the mouse or thealignment functions to move it back.

<h2><span class="orange">Cloning Objects</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/edit-clone.svg">
<kbd >Alt</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd> <b>Edit : Clone : Create Clone</b>
You can save yourself some time when you know how to use : <b>clones</b>.With <kbd >Alt</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd>, a clone can be created just as quickly as a copy or aduplicate. 
One only needs to remember that the option exists.
The new clone will appear right on top of the original, and will follow allmodifications made on the original, no matter if they affect its style (stroke,fill,…) or its shape.
The clone’s shape cannot be edited directly. 
Its colors can only be changed if the original has no color itself. 
Its size and rotation can be changed freely.
Tip
To remove a color from an object, you must ‘unset’ its paint, using thequestion mark button 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/paint-unknown.svg">
in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b>dialog.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/clones.png">
<b>All these stars are clones of the star in the top left corner. 
They have the same color and shape, but different sizes and rotations. 
Note that the selected clone does not have any star tool handles.</b>
To turn a clone into an independent, fully editable object, you need to<strong>unlink</strong> it from its original with <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Alt</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd>, <b>Edit : Clone : Unlink Clone</b> or by clicking on the corresponding icon 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/edit-clone-unlink.svg">
in the command bar.
To select the original of a clone, you can press <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >D</kbd> or use <b>Edit : Clone : Select Original</b> in the menu.

<h2><span class="orange">Grouping Objects</span></h2>
<strong>Grouping</strong>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/object_group_icon.png">
<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >G</kbd>, <b>Object : Group</b>
<strong>Ungrouping</strong>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/object_ungroup_icon.png">
<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >G</kbd>, <b>Object : Ungroup</b>
<strong>Grouping</strong> allows you to work with multiple objects as a single object: any changes you make will equally affect all members of the group, and the entire group can be copied, duplicated or cloned as a unit. 
Grouping your objects can help keep your canvas organized; for instance, if you’ve positioned several shapes in a nice even row, grouping them together will make sure that none of them become offset. 
Groups can also be nested within other groups.
<h2>Adding objects to a group</h2>
To demonstrate, consider a simple smiley face made of four objects: a big yellow circle, two black ellipses, and a curved line:
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/grouping_01.png">

Since we don’t want the eyes to get out of alignment, we should group them. 
Select both objects and then select Group from the commands bar, <b>Object</b> menu or keyboard shortcut:
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/grouping_02.png">

Note that we could also, if we wanted, group all four objects together at the same time. 
In this example, we’ll make three nested groups: one of the eyes, another of the face (mouth + eye-group), and a third of the whole head (head + face-group):
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/grouping_03.png">

Now the smiley face can be moved, rotated, and scaled as a single object.
<h2>Manipulating objects within a group</h2>
When you <strong>Enter</strong> a group, you gain the ability to select and manipulate its elements freely. 
To Enter a group you can either:
Double-click on the group
Right-click on it and select <b>Enter group</b> from the dropdown menu.
Left-click once on the group and press <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Enter</kbd>

Remember that groups can be nested! You may need to Enter multiple levels of groups before you reach the object you’re looking for.
When you’re done editing objects within a group, you need to Exit back out. 
To Exit a group you can either:
Double-left-click anywhere outside the group
Right-click on the group and select <b>Go to parent</b> from the dropdown menu.
Left-click once on the group and press <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Backspace</kbd>

Note that there is no indicator on the canvas of which group you are “in” at any given time (other than the feedback of which objects you can and cannot select individually). 
To find that information, look at the status bar or the Objects dialogue (<b>Object : Objects…</b>)
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Manipulating objects without entering a group</h3>
You can select and edit any individual item within a group, without either first entering or ungrouping said group, by holding <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> while left-clicking it. 
Note that this will select an item no matter how many nested groups “deep” it is – for example, in the smiley face up above, <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + clicking on one of the eyes would allow you to move it, even though it’s within a group within a group within a group.
Note that moving or manipulating an item in this way does not remove it from its group – once you release your selection, any further transformations of the group will continue to affect the object as before.

If the object you want to select is “underneath” another object, repeatedly pressing <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Alt</kbd> + left click will cycle through ALL objects in that location (high to low in z-order). 
Having the Object Properties tab open ( <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >O</kbd> ) can help to keep track of which object you’ve currently selected.
<h2>Removing objects from a group</h2>
To remove objects from a group you can either disband the entire group or pull one object out to the next level up.
To disband (“ungroup”) a group, you can either:
Select the group and choose <b>Object : Ungroup</b> from the menu bar or the Ungroup icon from the commands bar
Right-click on the group and choose <b>Ungroup</b> from the dropdown menu

Ungrouping returns <strong>all</strong> objects in the group to the next level up. 
If you want to extract only a single item while leaving the rest of the group in place, you need to first <strong>Enter</strong> the group. 
Then, either:
Select the object you wish to extract and choose <b>Object : Pop Selected Objects out of Group</b> from the menu bar
Right-click on the object and choose <b>Pop selection out of group</b> from the dropdown menu

Note that this will only move the object up one level higher – if you have multiple nested groups, you may need to repeat this process multiple times until the object is extracted to the desired level.

<h2><span class="orange">Align and Distribute</span></h2>

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/dialog-align-and-distribute.svg">
<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >A</kbd>
This dialog offers invaluable help. 
You can use it to align nodes andobjects vertically or horizontally, or to distribute them at equaldistances.
To use it for aligning nodes:
Open the dialog by clicking on its icon in the command bar to the right of the canvas.
Switch to the Node tool.
Select a couple of nodes.
Click on the node alignment button of your choice. 
The alignment will be applied immediately.


To align objects:
Open the dialog.
Switch to the Select tool.
Select the objects that you want to align.
Decide which one of the objects should not move at all. 
The object youselected first? The one you selected last? The biggest or the smallestone? Or perhaps you want to move all the objects in relation to the page? Inthe dropdown labelled <b>Relative to:</b>, select the option thatapplies.
Click on the alignment button of your choice. 
Use the tooltips that displaywhen you hover over them with the mouse to learn what each symbol means. 
Theselected alignment will be applied immediately.


<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/chaos.png">
<b>Before arranging the objects, they are distributed somewhat randomly on thecanvas.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/order.png">
<b>After aligning each row and column vertically and horizontally, theresult looks very neat.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/align_distribute_dialog.png">
<b>With the <b>Align and Distribute dialog</b>, it only takes a couple of clicks to arrange your objects neatly.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Tracing an Image</span></h2>
<a href="_images/trace_bitmap_icon.png">

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/trace_bitmap_icon.png" style="width: 40px; height: 40px;"></a> <kbd >Shift</kbd> + <kbd >Alt</kbd> + <kbd >B</kbd>, <b>Path : Trace Bitmap</b>
You can use this feature to turn a raster image to paths that you can useand edit in your design. 
This process is called ‘Tracing’ or ‘Vectorization’.If you expect a 100% faithful representation of your picture, though, only invector format, you will be disappointed.
The functionality is ideal to vectorize dark silhouettes in front of abright background. 
There is an option for keeping colors, but Inkscapewill then create one object for each color. 
You’ll find yourself facinga pile of objects, each of a different color. 
This can be difficult toedit, especially for a beginner.
To vectorize a picture:
Import a suitable bitmap image by using the menu<b>File : Import</b>.
Select the image with the Selector tool.
In the menu, go to <b>Path : Trace Bitmap</b>.
A dialog will open where you can set different options.
Use the <b>Update</b> button to get a new preview image whenever youchange the settings. 
When the result of the preview looks right, click<b>Ok</b>. 
The vectorized image will be available right on the canvas. 
Itwill be positioned exactly above your picture.
Tip
Sometimes, the vectorized version will be sosimilar to the original bitmap image, that you do not notice a difference.Use the Selector tool to move it to a different place on the canvas, so youcan examine it properly.
Let’s take a closer look at the options for this wonderful tool. 
The first taboffers several different choices in the <b>Mode</b> tab:
<dl ><dt>Brightness Cutoff Mode</dt><dd>This is the most frequently used mode. 
It will create a silhouette-like path that follows the shape of your image.</dd><dt>Edge Detection Mode</dt><dd>Useful if you only want to vectorize the contours of a shape.</dd><dt>Color Quantization Mode</dt><dd>This traces along borders between different colors.</dd></dl>
The mode <b>Multiple Scans</b> will give you a more detailed result, but itwill create a separate object for each scan.
Don’t forget to refresh the preview on the right of the dialog, and toclick on <b>Ok</b> to create the vector object.

There are 10 stackedobjects in the result.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/trace_bitmap_result_multi_colors_shifted.png">
<b>After ungrouping, the 10 objects can be moved.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Clipping and Masking</span></h2>
These two features are both employed in the same way: put the object that willserve as clip (or mask) above the object that you want to clip (or mask). 
Thenselect both objects, and use <b>Object : Clip : Set</b> or<b>Object : Mask : Set</b>. 
The top object will then becomeinvisible and work to hide parts of the bottom object.
Clips and masks give different results. 
A clip allows you to hide allparts of the bottom object that are outside the clip object. 
Thecolors of a mask object affect the opacity of the bottom object. 
Thedarker and the more transparent the mask, the more transparent themasked object will become. 
A white mask works just like a clip.

<b>On the left, the griffin’s head was clipped with the circle. 
On the right, the circle was used as a mask.</b>

<h2><span class="orange">Filters</span></h2>
One of the menu entries is dedicated to <strong>filters</strong>. 
More precisely, allof these are combinations of SVG filters. 
The possibilities ofcombination are infinite, and the Inkscape developers put somecombination suggestions into the menu and tried to find a descriptivename for each.
To apply a filter, you need to first select one or more objects, thenselect the filter you want to use. 
The result will immediately beavailable on the canvas.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/menu-filtre.png">

<h2>The Drop Shadow Filter</h2>
This filter promises to automatically add a shadow to the selected object thatwill be placed below the object. 
First, select one or more objects, then openthe filter’s dialog with <b>Filters : Shadows and Glows : DropShadow</b>.
The dialog allows you to define the amount of blur, the shadow’soffset, it’s type, and its color. 
The larger the blur radius, the more distantwill the object seem from its shadow. 
The farther away the values for the x andy offset are from 0, the more will it look as if the light comes from the side.
The dropdown for the shadow type allows you to choose between:
<b>Outer</b>: normal shadow
<b>Inner</b>: the object looks like it were a hole
<b>Outer Cutout</b>: just the outer shadow, the object will be invisible
<b>Inner Cutout</b>: just the inner shadow, without the object
<b>Shadow Only</b>: the full shadow, without the object

In the <b>Color</b> tab, you can change the shadow’s color and opacity (theintensity of the shadow).
If you want to play with different values, check the little box labelled<b>Live Preview</b>, then the result will be shown on the canvas. 
It willonly be applied to the object when you click <b>Apply</b>.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/ombre-portee-w.png">

<h2>Editing Filters</h2>
Inkscape offers a dialog for editing filters, which can be opened from the entry<b>Filter Editor</b> at the bottom of the <b>Filters</b> menu.
When the dialog opens, and there is no filter applied to the currently selectedobjects, it will be empty. 
When there is an object with a filter selected, youwill see the components of the object’s current filter.
The basic principle of the dialog is simple, but understanding all itsramifications is highly complex. 
One needs to have a deep knowledge in SVGfilters and matrix mathematics to be able to understand how to use theparameters of every available filter to achieve a specific result.
Because of this, the easier option may be to just play with the filter settingsrandomly, starting from one of the stock filters that is similar to the desiredresult.
Here is a list of some interesting filters:
<b>Distort : Chalk and Sponge</b>: turns objects into an interestingexplosion.
<b>Image Paint and Draw : Pencil</b>: converts the selected objects to asketch.
<b>Scatter</b>: Several filters that give different scatter effects.
<b>Blurs</b>: Offers several blur variations.
<b>Morphology</b>: Offers filters that have to do with the objects’contours.

It’s up to you to explore this further. 
The result of most filters dependsheavily on the selected objects.

<h2><span class="orange">Extensions</span></h2>
In this submenu, you will find functionality that does not target Inkscape’smain objective, but that has still been accepted into the Inkscape program byits developers.
They are grouped into some very distinct categories:
<b>Arrange</b>: Affects the stacking order and grouping of objects.
<b>Color</b>: Affects only the color of the selected objects.
<b>Document</b>: Changes and informs about specific document properties.
<b>Export</b>: Offers exporting functionalities and export preparation.
<dl ><dt><b>Gcodetools</b>: For generating GCodeand communicating with cutting</dt><dd>machines.</dd></dl>
<b>Generate from Path</b> and <b>Modify Path</b>: These extension scripts need a path to start with, so they can create something from it.
<dl ><dt><b>Images</b> and <b>Raster</b>: Both of these categories affect raster</dt><dd>images that are linked or embedded in the SVG file.</dd></dl>
<b>JessyInk</b>: For creating animated presentation slides.
<b>Render</b>: Generates new objects on the canvas.
<b>Stylesheet</b>: Associates your SVG with the web design.
<b>Text</b>: Offers additional functionalities for working with text.
<b>Typography</b>: For quickly creating SVG fonts (independently from SVGFont Editor).
<b>Visualize Path</b>: Offers multiple options to visualize differentproperties of a path.
<b>Web</b>: Allows you to add some simple Javascript or do some layoutingfor the web.

We will now take a closer look at some of the extensions.

<h2>Some Very Useful Extensions in Detail</h2>
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Interpolate</h3>
This extension draws the steps that convert one path into another one. 
Start bycreating a first path, and then another one that is the goal of thetransformation. 
Select both paths and open this extension’s dialog with<b>Extensions : Generate from Path : Interpolate</b>. 
It will askyou for the number of steps you want to generate.  When you hit<b>Apply</b>, the result will appear on the canvas. 
It consists of a groupof as many paths as you have indicated for the <b>Steps</b> value. 
Thepaths will all have the same style. 
You can ungroup them, when you want to editeach path separately and customize their styles.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/extension_interpolate.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Pattern along Path</h3>
This extension chains copies of an object, so they follow the curvature of apath that you have drawn. 
First draw your path. 
You can use the Pen/Bézier toolfor this. 
Then create your pattern. 
The pattern can be a path, even one thatconsists of multiple subpaths, and even a group.
Make sure that your pattern is on top of the path in the stacking order. 
Selectthe two objects, then open the extension dialog with <b>Extensions: Generate from Path : Pattern along Path</b>.
The dialog will ask you to decide whether the pattern should be repeated as manytimes as possible on the path, or if it should be stretched, to start at thepath’s start, and end exactly at its end point (and not after that). 
The<b>deformation type</b> option allows you to select whether to simply chainthe objects, or to make them look like they are printed on a ribbon. 
The otheroptions are about adjusting the objects’ position in relation to each other andto the path.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/motifchemin-w.png">


<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/extension_pattern_along_path.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Color Markers</h3>
This extension allows you to edit the color of object’s markers. 
They can eitherbe adapted to fit the object’s colors (which is the default), or you can selecta specific color yourself. 
You need to select the path with the markers that youwant to change, then open the dialog with <b>Extensions : ModifyPath : Color Markers</b>. 
When you have selected the options you need, click on<b>Apply</b>.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/colorermarqueur-w.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Edge 3D</h3>
After having selected a path, you can open the extension’s dialog with<b>Extensions : Modify Path : Edge 3D</b>. 
As Inkscape is a 2Dsoftware, the 3D effect can only be simulated. 
You can refine the 3D illusion byadjusting the values for the blur, the lighting angle and the width. 
The previewis very useful for tweaking the result. 
Hit <b>Apply</b> when you aresatisfied with what you see.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/contour3D-w.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Envelope/Perspective</h3>
These extensions allow you to automatically deform a path to meet a perspectiveor to fit into a 4-sided shape, which you indicate by drawing a rectangularshape.
For example, you may have drawn a piece of furniture in a room in perspective,and now you would like to put a design onto its faces. 
Draw a rectangle in theshape of the furniture’s face.
Then use the extension with <b>Extensions : Modify Path :Envelope</b> or <b>Perspective</b>. 
Now, the path will be deformed to fitthe selected frame.
Note that this extension will only work with paths

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/extension_envelope.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Barcode</h3>
This set of extensions that you can find under <b>Extensions :Render : Barcode</b> allows you to create lots and lots of different barcodes, QRcodes and even data matrices. 
You only need to enter your numbers or texts, andInkscape will do the rest for you.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/extension_barcode.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Printing Marks</h3>
If you would like to get your design printed and you need the typical printingmarks, then this extenstion, which you can find at <b>Extensions: Render : Layout : Printing Marks</b> will be tremendously useful.
You can select the kind of printing marks that you need (crop marks,registration marks etc.), and the extension will do the rest for you.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/marque-impression.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Text</h3>
In this category, we can see the extension labelled <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>,which is a generator for placeholder texts. 
When you open the extension’sdialog, it asks you to indicate the number of paragraphs and sentences, and theamount of length difference between single paragraphs. 
‘Lorem Ipsum’ is apseudo-Latin text, which can be used to fill the text boxes in your layout witha placeholder text. 
The generated text will be placed at the top of the page.

<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/extension_lorem_ipsum.png">

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Installing Extensions</h3>
It is easy to install extensions created by the community, or, for those whoknow how to write in the Python programming language, to write their own. 
Tolearn more about the inner workings of Inkscape extensions, visit <a href="https://inkscape.org/develop/extensions/">the Inkscapewebsite</a>.
Many extensions can be found in the <a href="https://inkscape.org/gallery/=extension/">website’s gallery</a>.
Note that these extensions are not curated, and that many extension developerschoose to publish their extension on other websites.
Generally, to install a new extension, you need to download and unpackits files. 
Copy the files into the directory listed at <b>Edit :Preferences : System: User extensions</b>. 
After a restart of Inkscape, thenew extension will be available. 
Some extensions may come with differentinstallation instructions.
A couple of extensions may depend on other programs, that will need tobe installed on your computer for them to work correctly. 
Usually, theauthor of the extension will provide instructions for this.

<h2><span class="orange">Live Path Effects</span></h2>
Even more effects are available in the <b>Path Effects</b> dialog, which you can access as <b>Path Effects</b> from the bottom of the <b>Path</b> menu entry.
When you don’t have a path selected, the dialog will prompt you to choose one before you can proceed. 
Click on the plus sign to see a list of available path effects. 
Select one of them, then click on <b>Add</b>. 
Now you will be presented with a list of options for the selected effect. 
In most cases, the path will already look different from before now.
You can adjust a path with a Live Path Effect by the options in its dialog, and also by manipulating the path’s handles on the canvas.
Here’s a description of some of the Path Effects (LPEs). 
Don’t hesitate to discover the functionality of the others on your own:
<dl ><dt>Power Stroke</dt><dd>Adds handles that allow you to change the width of the path, so it can be different at different points of the path.</dd><dt>Sketch</dt><dd>Transforms your path into multiple lines that look like a sketch drawn with a pencil.</dd><dt>Perspective / Envelope</dt><dd>Seriously helpful for drawing in perspective, thanks to the addition of 4 handles for the corners.</dd><dt>Knot</dt><dd>Creates gaps in the bottom parts of a path, when they cross with another part of the path.</dd><dt>Hatches</dt><dd>Transforms your shape into hatches that can be heavily customized.</dd><dt>Interpolate subpaths</dt><dd>The principle is the same as for the <b>Interpolate</b> extension, but the LPE approaches the topic differently.</dd><dt>Pattern along Path</dt><dd>The principle is similar to the extension with the same name, but the pattern parts will all be parts of the same path.</dd></dl>
Now we have taken a small tour around all the effects that add functionality to Inkscape and allow you to automate specific tasks. 
This book is only an introduction to Inkscape. 
Do not hesitate to further explore the software once you feel at ease with its basic functionality.

<h2><span class="orange">Customizing keyboard shortcuts</span></h2>
Inkscape allows you to use your own custom keyboard shortcuts. 
There are various reasons why you would want to change those:
you have used a different graphics software before, and would like to keep theshortcuts the same, so you don’t need to learn so many new ones
your keyboard layout makes it very hard to press some key combinations
certain key combinations are already in use on your computer, and you do not want to change them just for Inkscape
you want to assign a shortcut to a functionality in Inkscape that doesn’t have a shortcut by default

You can change the shortcuts at <b>Edit : Preferences : Interface : Keyboard Shortcuts</b>.
The dialog lets you choose between some prefilled keyboard shortcut maps that resemble those of other graphics programs.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/keyboard_shortcuts_choose_keymap.png">
<b>You can choose between a couple of presets for the keyboard shortcuts.</b>
In addition to this, you can overwrite any shortcut by:
selecting it from the list;
clicking on the field in the <b>Shortcut</b> column;
pressing the new shortcut, when it says <b>New accelerator</b> in thatfield. 
Pressing <kbd >Backspace</kbd> will reset the shortcut to its default value.


<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/setting_new_keyboard_shortcut.png">
<b>When it says ‘New accelerator’, press the new shortcut.</b>

Alpha is tied to the color. 
Independently of this, each object can have an additional value for its opacity. 
The opacity value affects the object as a whole (as opposed to alpha, which affects only the transparency of the stroke or the fill of the object).</dd><dt id="term-appimage">AppImage</dt><dd>A standalone packaging format for programs that run on Linux. 
AppImages are (mostly) self-contained executable files, that can be saved anywhere on your computer. 
To be able to run it as a program, you need to allow your computer to execute it by (usually) right-clicking on the file and editing its properties. 
This may mean to check a checkbox with the label ‘file is executable’.

A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1.</dd><dt id="term-cap">Cap</dt><dd>The shape that is put on the end nodes of a path. 
This can be a half circle or a half square, that is as wide as the path’s stroke. 
Or the path can just be cut off at a 90° angle.</dd><dt id="term-cascading-style-sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</dt><dd>A way to write out styling information for documents such as HTML and SVG. 
The CSS specification is developed by the W3C, just like the SVG file format. 
CSS determines how websites look in a browser. 
For SVG, it is one of two options to describe how an object is supposed to look.</dd><dt id="term-clone">Clone</dt><dd>A copy of another object that follows every change made to the original object. 
An object can have multiple clones that can all be positioned in different places in the drawing. 
Clones can be rotated and scaled independently of the original object. 
If the original’s fill or stroke is not set (unset), the clone’s fill (or stroke) can be edited. 
In all other cases, the clone’s fill and stroke will look just like the original’s.</dd><dt id="term-disk-image-dmg">Disk Image (.dmg)</dt><dd>A Disk Image is a special type of file that is commonly used for distributing software on macOS.

If you have never used reST before, please familiarize yourself with its syntax(links to cheatsheets below), or diligently copy-paste what you see here or inother parts of the documentation. 
Note that spaces (and how many there are) arealways relevant. 
Without them, the automatical document creator does notunderstand what you mean, and may give unexpected results. 
Backticks (this one:`, not apostrophes: ‘) are used frequently in delimiting different elements.
<h2>Second level heading (h2)</h2>
It’s best to have this document opened as the finished web page, and as thesource text in parallel. 
That way you can see the syntax, and how it will lookwhen the documentation has been auto-created.
This is text in a paragraph. 
Separate paragraphs by an empty line. 
<strong>This</strong> isprinted bold, and <em>this</em> is in italics. 
<code><b>This</b></code> is for codeand other smallcommandline commands that are used inline.
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Third level heading (h3)</h3>
Links to cheatsheets in a list:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/master/docs/demo/structure.rst">Structure Overview</a>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/master/docs/demo/demo.rst">Paragraph Level Markup Overview</a>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/master/docs/demo/lists_tables.rst">Lists &amp; Tables Overview</a>
<h4>Fourth level heading (h4)</h4>
A numbered list with useful links:
<a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape Website</a>
This is a paragraph in a list
An internal link to another book chapter uses its file name (without the ‘.rst’): <a href="3d-boxes.html"><b>Link to 3D Boxes</b></a>
If you want to link to another section in this manual (this can be in any file, or in this one), you must put a so called label there (with underscore).


Then you write the <b>link to that label</b></a> (no underscore) here.


If you want to refer to a section that starts with a heading, you do not need to use a label. 
You can just directly refer to it like this: Third level heading (h3).
A download link, e.g. 
for an example file that users can play with, will look like this: <a download="" href="_downloads/01c0340d640861509263d76add089817/glyph_a.svg"><code><b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>Glyph</b> <b>A</b> <b>file</b></code></a>



Images can be used within a sentence or line, or as a larger image with a description.
An image within a sentence can be something like this icon 
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/tool-pointer.svg">. 
You decide on a name for the image that you put into the text. 
Then, you specify its properties in a separate block. 
It’s best to put these blocks at the bottom of the document (scroll down to the end to see it). 
This type of image can be described as an ‘inline image’.


All images that show a part of the Inkscape interface should be formatted like this and have the class ‘screenshot’, a caption and an alt attribute. 
Screenshots should be in the png file format and the relevant area should be as large as possible:
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/calligraphy_tool_tracing.png">
<b>This is a caption for the image. 
Text should wrap around the caption. 
You can add a ‘target’ line above, if you want to link to something.</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pattern02.png">
<b>You can also use a <cite>two-column</cite> container, and the figures …</b>
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pattern04.png">
<b>… will fit on one or two columns, depending on the displaywidth.</b>


Images that are used for mere decoration look like this. 
You can use png images. 
If you want to use an SVG image, you must also provide a pdf with the same content and give it the same name. 
Then, you would need to replace the file extension by an asterisk in the page source.
<img src="https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/vector-format.png">

Available classes:
for alignment: left, center, right
for size: small, medium, large


If you want to tell the user how to get somewhere using the menu, use the menu selection markup, e.g. 
<b>Edit : Preferences : Input/Output : Autosave</b>


For a label in the interface, use the gui label markup, e.g. 
<b>Enable gradient editing</b>.


If you want to tell the user which key to press, use the keyboard shortcut markup, e.g. 
<kbd >Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd >C</kbd>.


For referencing a specific file on the user’s computer, use the markup for files, e.g. 
<code><b>~/.config/inkscape/preferences.xml</b></code>


If you need to quote someone, or another document, do this by indenting by 4 spaces:

<h2><span class="orange">From the Top</span></h2>
Inkscape is a professional-quality vector-graphics software program which runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
Design professionals and hobbyists worldwide use it to create a mind-boggling variety of graphics, including illustrations, icons, logos, diagrams, maps, and web graphics.
It uses W3C open standard SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its native format, and, very importantly, it is free and open-source software.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">About This Tutorial</span></h2>
The wheel has been invented a long time ago.
However, whenever a new model of bicycle or car is designed, a new model of tire might have to be created along with it to ensure driving ease and comfort.
This series of tutorials can be considered as a new tire for a new design of computer illustration program.
Its underlying principle is that you learn by doing, so the approach is hands-on.
Lessons are step-by-step.
You learn at your own pace.
Inkscape 1.0.1 has been around since 6 September 2020.
Features have been improved, bugs have been fixed, and the future holds great promise for a wealth of innovations.
I salute and praise the Inkscape community, all volunteers, who give of their time, thought, imagination, and care to provide the world with a tool that helps to fuel an artist’s passion to create.
Each chapter contains a project for you to explore.
As you work on each aspect of the project, you learn new concepts and techniques.
You are also invited to explore further, experiment, and just play with what you’re learning.
Images created for this tutorial were created using Inkscape 1.0.1 and Irfanview 4.56 on a Windows 10-based PC.
The Web pages are made responsive using Bootstrap 4.5.2.
As of this writing, Scribus, which is used in Tutorial 20, has just been upgraded to version 1.5.8 (almost hot off the press or hot off the CPU).

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">What You Need to Know Before You Start</span></h2>
You need to be comfortable with your computer and its operating system.
Know how to work with the keyboard, mouse, menus, and commands.
Also, be familiar with opening, saving, and closing files.
Review any printed or online Windows documentation if necessary.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Additional Resources</span></h2>
There is a treasure trove of support on and off the Web.
The best starting place for supplementary learning materials is the <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape web site</a>.
Tutorials are at the <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/">tutorials page</a> and book recommendations are at the <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/learn/books/">books page</a>.
There is also an active Inkscape community that welcomes newcomers at the <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/community/">Inkscape community page</a> with forums, blogs, galleries that you can contribute to, and more.
Feel free to join the community and contribute to Inkscape’s development and use as a “people’s computer graphics design program.”

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 1 – Getting Acquainted with the Work Area</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/Tutorial01Fig00.png" alt="Sample art work" class="lazy">
Learning the parts of the work area and how to navigate among them will help you make effective use of Inkscape.
The work area includes the canvas, page, scratch area, and toolbars.
In this tutorial on the work area, you will learn: how to open an Inkscape file.
how to select tools from the toolbar.
how to magnify and reduce the size of an image.
how to work with dialogs.
how to use the Inkscape Manual.
You will be working on an art file in this tutorial.
Double-click the Inkscape icon to launch Inkscape.
The work area appears after several seconds of uploading Inkscape into your computer’s CPU.
It might take up to a minute or more on a slow computer.
Be patient! Inkscape will come up.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/OpeningWorkArea.gif" alt="Image of initial work area" class="lazy">
Click on the <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/Tutorial01Fig00.svg"><b>Tutorial01Image01.svg</b></a> link in this tutorial and download the <strong>Tutorial01Image01.svg</strong> file to your computer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/Fig02.png" alt="Art work" height="500" width="355" class="lazy">
The image is larger than will fit on the screen — its bottom is hidden behind the horizontal scroll bar.
To resize the image so that it fits just right in the screen, click on the <b>Zoom in or out (F3)</b> icon 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom in or out icon" width="26">
in the toolbox on the left of the screen, and then click on the <b>Zoom to fit page in window (5)</b> icon in the toolbar above the work area  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomToFit.gif" alt="Zoom to fit page in window icon" width="26">.
The image now fits perfectly in the window.
We’ll work more with the Zoom function later in this tutorial.
Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s..., name the file <b>Music</b>, and navigate to a folder where you would like to store the file using the <b>Save in</b> menu.
In the <b>Save as Type</b> bar, leave the type of file format set to the <b>Inkscape SVG (*.svg)</b> default format, and click <b>Save</b>.
Inkscape will automatically append the <b>.svg</b> (<b>s</b>calable <b>v</b>ector <b>g</b>raphics) extension to the filename.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">What’s in the Work Area</span></h2>
The <b>Canvas</b>: The canvas is all the space inside the Inkscape window available for you to draw on.
It includes the area that houses the artwork you're working on and the area outside the page boundary.
The <b>Page</b>: The page, also called the <b>artboard</b>, is part of the canvas.
It is bounded by solid lines and represents the region containing printable artwork.
By default, the artboard is the same size as a 210 mm × 297 mm sheet of A4 paper, but you can enlarge it (for example, up to 11 in.
× 17 in.
and larger) or reduced to card-size.
The <b>Scratch Area</b>: The scratch area is all the area outside of the page boundaries.
You can use this space for storing pieces of imagery that you can use later in your artwork, trying out experiments, doodling, and more.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Viewing Your Artwork</span></h2>
When you first open a file, Inkscape displays it in <b>Normal</b> view mode.
In this mode, you can see how the artwork will print.
If you are working on an image that is really large or complex, you might prefer to view the work in <b>Outline</b> mode.
You will see only the outlines of individual objects.
Objects that are partially or totally hidden behind others will be visible as outlines, thus allowing you to manipulate them more easily.
You also give Inkscape a break because it doesn't have to redraw the screen every time you make a change.
Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>D</u>isplay mode &gt; <u>O</u>utline.
You now see only the outlines of objects.
Use this view mode to find objects that are not visible in <b>Normal</b> mode.
Now choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>D</u>isplay mode &gt; <u>N</u>ormal.
The image returns to its previous color version.
Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>C</u>olor display mode &gt; <u>G</u>rayscale.
Colors are transformed to their grayscale equivalents.
Use <b><u>G</u>rayscale</b> as a way of previewing your work before printing it using a laserjet printer or displaying it using a non-color medium.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Acquainted with the Toolbox</span></h2>
The Inkscape toolbox contains selection tools, drawing, painting, and erasing tools, and more tools whose uses you’ll find more about as you go through these tutorials.
You make a tool active by either clicking on it or using a shortcut key (also called a or <b>Hot Key</b>) combination as shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/Toolbar%20with%20Labels.png" alt="Toolbar with Labels" width="600" class="lazy">
Toolbar, Tool Hot Keys, and Hidden Tool Submenu.
The <b>Mesh</b>, <b>Dropper</b>, and <b>Connector</b> tools are available when you click on the double-arrow button  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/DoubleArrowButton.gif" alt="Double-arrow button at the bottom of the toolbar" width="26">
at the bottom of the toolbox.
You select a tool by either clicking on its icon in the toolbox or by pressing the tool’s keyboard shortcut key combination (<b>Hot Key</b> combination).
For example, you press F3 to select the <b>Zoom in or out</b> tool.
Selected tools stay active until you choose a different tool.
If you can't remember the shortcut key for a tool, you can position the cursor over that tool’s icon and a tooltip will appear showing you the tool’s name and shortcut key.
The <b>Inkscape manual</b> also contains a list of all the shortcut keys.
You’ll learn about the <b>Inkscape manual</b> later in this tutorial.
For the sake of easy reading, I will call tools by a shortened name.
For example: Select and transform objects tool — Select tool Edit paths by nodes tool — Node tool Zoom in or out tool — Zoom tool and so on … 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Changing the View of Your Artwork</span></h2>
You can magnify or demagnify your artwork using a few different tools.
Inkscape shows you the percentage of the image's actual size in the Zoom bar located in the lower right corner of the Inkscape screen: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomBar.png" alt="Zoom bar location" class="lazy">
When you use any of the viewing tools, only the screen display of your work is affected, not its actual size.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">View Commands</span></h2>
Magnify or demagnify the view of the artwork by doing the following: Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; Zoom In to enlarge the display of the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork.
Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; Zoom Out to reduce the display of the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork.
Each time you use a <b>Zoom In</b> or <b>Zoom Out</b> command, the view of the artwork is resized to the next predefined zoom amount.
You can see the percentage amount in the Zoom bar in the lower right corner of the screen.
You can also use the <b>View</b> menu to fit the artwork to your screen, or to view it at actual size.
Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; <u>P</u>age.
A reduced view of the entire document is displayed in the window.
The magnification is at 48%.
Pressing the number <b>5</b> (shortcut key) produces the same result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomToFitPageInWindow.gif" alt="Page view" class="lazy">
Page view.
Now choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; Page <u>W</u>idth.
The artwork is magnified so that the artwork page width spans the width of the Inkscape screen.
Pressing the number <b>6</b> (shortcut key) does the same thing.
Note the percentage amount of zoom in the Zoom bar (153%).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/PageWidthView.gif" alt="Page width view" class="lazy">
Page width view.
Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; <u>D</u>rawing.
The screen now shows the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork in exactly the same way as you saw it using the <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; <u>P</u>age command.
These two views are similar because the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork fits almost exactly on the drawing page.
If the image was smaller, then it would be magnified to fit the screen.
In the case above, the magnification is at 47% instead of 48%.
Another useful viewing function allows you to select a specific item in your artwork with the Select tool and expand the view to focus on the object of interest.
Try it out by: clicking on the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection Tool" width="26">)(Note the <b>Select and transform objects</b> tooltip that appears when you hover over the tool icon): 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ClickOnSelection.gif" alt="Click on the Selection tool" class="lazy">
then clicking on a spot in the artwork that you would like to get a closer look at: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/SelectObject.png" alt="Selecting an object" class="lazy">
and then choosing <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; <u>S</u>election.
The object you selected now fills the screen awaiting your close examination.
Note the <b>bounding box</b> surrounding the selected object that helps you distinguish the selected object from the others.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">The Zoom Tool</span></h2>
In addition to the View commands, you can use the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In or Out tool" width="26">
in the toolbox to magnify and reduce the view of artwork.
Use the <b>View</b> menu to select predefined magnification levels or to fit your artwork inside the document window.
Click the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In or Out tool" width="26">
in the toolbar to select the tool, and move the cursor into the document window.
Notice that a plus sign appears at the center of the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/MagnifierPlus.gif" alt="Zoom tool with plus sign">.
Position the Zoom tool over the topmost treble clef and click once.
The artwork is now displayed at a higher magnification.
Click two more times in the same spot.
The view is increased again, and you'll notice that the area you click is magnified.
The spot that you clicked on stays centered underneath the cursor.
Next, you'll reduce the view of the artwork.
With the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In or Out tool" width="26">
still selected, position the pointer over the uppermost bass clef and hold down the &lt;Shift&gt; key.
A minus sign appears at the center of the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/MagnifierMinus.gif" alt="Demagnifier tool">.
With the &lt;Shift&gt; key still depressed, click in the artwork twice.
The view of the artwork is reduced.
You can achieve a much more controlled and effective zoom by dragging a marquee to magnify a specific area of your artwork.
With the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In or Out tool" width="26">
still selected, hold the left mouse button down and drag over the area of the illustration you want to magnify; watch as a marquee appears around the area you are dragging, then release the mouse button.
The area that was included in the marqueed area is now enlarged to fit the size of the document window.

Resulting view Repeat this technique to get to the end of the sequence of treble clefs or bass clefs in the artwork! You can do some serious magnifying! (Inkscape allows you to get up to a magnification of 25,600%! That's really high magnification!) 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/EndOfTheLine.png" alt="Highly magnified area" class="lazy">
The end of the line.
<b>Note</b>: You can draw a marquee with the Zoom tool to enlarge the view of artwork, but you cannot draw a marquee to reduce it.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">The Zoom Tool bar</span></h2>
When you click on the Zoom tool, the Zoom Toolbar appears just above the view screen.
It contains icon versions of all the Zoom commands available to you in the <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom menu.
A tooltip appears when you hover over a tool icon.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomToolbar.gif" alt="Zoom toolbar" class="lazy">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomToFit.gif" alt="Zoom to fit page in window icon">
to resize the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork.
Click on the <b>Zoom to 1:1</b> icon  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomTo11Button.gif" alt="Zoom to 1:1 icon">.
The artwork is redrawn to 100% of the drawing size.
At this scale, one Inkscape drawing pixel equals one screen pixel.
Click on the <b>Zoom to 1:2</b> icon  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomTo12Button.gif" alt="Zoom to 1:2 icon">.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/NextZoomButton.gif" alt="Next Zoom button">
to retrace your viewing history.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">The Quick View Tool</span></h2>
This tool is great for letting you quickly view single, and perhaps tiny, items in a complicated piece of artwork without having to select a specific magnification.
With the Select tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">, select any of the individual clefs in the artwork.
A really small clef is a good choice.
With the clef selected (you'll see the selection bounding box), press the <b>q</b> key (capital <b>Q</b> works, also).
The clef is magnified to fit the screen so you can easily see its details.
Note that it is inside a bounding box to help you distinguish the clef as being selected.
Release the <b>q</b> key.
The original artwork appears.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">If Your Mouse Has a Wheel</span></h2>
If your mouse has a wheel, press &lt;Ctrl&gt; and roll forward to magnify your artwork incrementally.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt; and roll the wheel backward to demagnify incrementally.
Try it out on the <b>Music.svg</b> picture.
Place the cursor at one or another particular spot in the artwork and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-roll forward the wheel.
See how the spot where the cursor is located stays put.
Now, place the cursor somewhere else and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-roll backward.
The artwork is reduced in size with the cursor location staying in place.
Recenter and resize the artwork by clicking on the <b>Zoom to fit page in window</b> icon 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomToFit.gif" alt="Zoom to fit">
in the Zoom bar.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Moving Around the Canvas</span></h2>

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Using the Scroll Bars</span></h2>
You can move left, right, up, and down using the horizontal and vertical scroll bars.
With the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork zoomed to fit the drawing page, move it around left and right, and up and down using the scroll bars to get an initial feel for doing this.
Now, click on the Zoom tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In or Out tool" width="26">
and then click on the <b>Zoom to 2:1</b> icon  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomTo21Button.gif" alt="Zoom to 2:1 icon">
in the Zoom bar.
Note that the scroll bars have shrunk in size.
Move around the artwork and get a feel for how their sensitivity to movement has changed.
Click on the <b>Zoom to 1:2</b> icon  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomTo12Button.gif" alt="Zoom to 1:2 icon">.
See how the scroll bars have increased in size, especially the horizontal scroll.
Now move the artwork hither and thither, over and yonder.
Feel the difference in movement sensitivity.
You can move the drawing page only a limited amount horizontally, but you can move it out of sight vertically.
Play with different magnifications to get a good feel for how the scroll bars work.
Note that Inkscape can have difficulties keeping up with you if you scroll quickly.
If you are working with a large piece of work and need to look quickly in various places, you can scroll slowly enough that Inkscape can redraw your new location in time, or switch to <b>Outline</b> view, whereby Inkscape has less redrawing to do as you move.
As you gain experience with Inkscape, you will figure out ways to navigate your artwork with greater speed and efficiency.
There is no single cut-and-dry method for doing your work quickly.
You might choose to use one techique in one situation and another technique in yet another type of situation.
What you do depends upon how comfortable you feel with the techniques and what works best for you at this or that moment, and comfort comes with experience.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Using the Mouse Wheel</span></h2>
You can move left and right, up and down easily with the mouse wheel.
Mouse wheel forward moves you upscreen, mouse wheel backward moves you downscreen.
Pressing &lt;Shift&gt;-wheel forward moves you to the left of the screen, causing the view to move right.
Pressing &lt;Shift&gt;-wheel backward moves you to the right of the screen, causing the view to move left.
But don't just read these words! Do it! Center and resize the <b>Music.svg</b> artwork using the <b>Zoom to fit page in window</b> icon  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomToFit.gif" alt="Zoom to fit">
in the Zoom bar.
Roll the mouse wheel forward and see how fast the artwork drops down and disappears off the screen.
Now roll the mouse wheel backward a bit more slowly and watch the artwork reappear.
Center it on the screen.
Now press the &lt;Shift&gt; key and roll the mouse wheel forward.
The artwork moves to the right and off the screen as your view shifts to the left.
Bring the picture back by &lt;Shift&gt;-backward rolling the wheel.
Center the artwork.
Increase the size of the picture using the <b>Zoom to 1:2</b> icon 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/ZoomTo12Button.gif" alt="Zoom to 1:2 icon">.
Using combinations of rolling the mouse wheel and &lt;Shift&gt;-rolling the mouse wheel, traverse the train of treble clefs from largest to smallest.
Then, cross down to the smallest bass clefs and move through the train of bass clefs to the largest one.
<b>Note</b>: Remember that just moving the mouse wheel moves your view <strong>up and down</strong>, using &lt;Shift&gt;-mouse wheel moves your view <strong>left and right</strong>, and using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-mouse wheel <strong>enlarges and reduces</strong> your view.
I recommend committing these techniques to memory because they will come in very handy.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Removing the Scroll Bars</span></h2>
Both the horizontal and vertical scroll bars occupy space that you might need as you do your work.
You can toggle them off and on by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-b (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-B works, too).
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-b.
The scroll bars disappear.
Move around using any technique you'd like.
The view still moves as if the scroll bars were still there.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-b to turn the scroll bars back on.
Now you are aware that a little bit of screen space is covered up by the bars.
Whether you need to see the scroll bars or not depends upon your artwork and your preference.
If the bars hide important details around the edges, then turn them off.
If they help guide you as you locate items in the work, turn or keep them on.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Working with Dockable Dialogs</span></h2>
Dockable dialogs are dialog windows that can help to make modifying artwork easier by readily giving you access to many of Inkscape’s functions.
By default, they appear on the right side of the screen.
You can rearrange them, resize them (space permitting), stack them one ontop another, and turn them into icons for later use.
Below we see one dockable dialog for the Fill and Stroke function: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/DockableDialog1.gif" alt="One dockable dialog visible" class="lazy">
Clicking on the exit symbol  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/Xit.gif" alt="Exit symbol" width="15" height="14">
in the upper right corner of the dialog window will remove the dialog from the screen.
However, clicking on the small arrow symbol  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/IconifyArrow.gif" alt="Iconify symbol" width="15" height="15">
will reduce the dialog window to an icon which is placed as a strip along the right side of the screen.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/IconifiedDialog.png" alt="Iconified dialog" class="lazy">
If you have two or more dialogs up, you switch between them by clicking in one or the other.
You can also iconify both to open up space and yet keep the dialogs available for immediate use.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/DockableDialogs.gif" alt="Two dialogs up, one active" class="lazy">
Two dialogs up and available.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/DockableDialogsIconified.png" alt="Two dialogs iconified" class="lazy">
The previous two dialogs iconified.
You can literally tear off a dialog from its position on the right side of the screen and make it a free-floating window.
Left-click on the dialog’s title bar and drag it to the middle of the screen.
This capability of moving dialogs to other places on the screen might be a boon to artists and designers who work well with a fluidly manageable work area.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial01/images/FloatingDialog.gif" alt="Free-floating dialog" class="lazy">

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/DeBesteFriten.png" alt="Sample art work" class="lazy">
Choosing the correct selection method to make changes to objects is an essential skill to develop.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to correctly locate and select objects using the Selection tools, as well as protect objects by hiding and locking.
Later, you will build on these methods by integrating layers.
In this tutorial on the work area, you will learn how to: differentiate when to use the Selection, Edit path by nodes, or Select by grouping tools.
group and ungroup items.
clone items with the Select tool.
lock and hide items for organizational purposes.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Prepping for this tutorial</span></h2>
You might have heard the saying, "You have to select it, to affect it." When changing colors, sizes, adding effects or any number of attributes, you must first select the object to which you are applying the changes.
Consider this tutorial a primer in the fundamentals of the Selection tools.
More advanced selection techniques using layers are discussed in Tutorial 7, “Working with Layers.” Start Inkscape.

Click outside the top left of the first star and drag a marquee that encompasses each star on the first row to select all three.
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup, then press &lt;Esc&gt;.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), click on the first star.
Notice that since it is grouped with the other two stars, all three become selected.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/AllThreeStarsGrouped.gif" alt="Grouped stars with rubberband box" class="lazy">
Click one, all in the group become selected.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Adding to a Group</span></h2>
Groups can also be nested; that is, they can be grouped within other objects or groups to form larger groups.
With the top group of three stars still selected, &lt;Shift&gt;+click on the first star in the second row.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/AddingToTheGroup1.gif" alt="Adding a star to a group of three" class="lazy">

&lt;Shift&gt;+click on the middle star in the second row and also choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.
Press &lt;Esc&gt; when finished.
Now, click on any of the five grouped stars.
See how the top and middle rows of stars are enclosed in the bounding box.
Click anywhere outside the box to deselect the group, and then click on the third star in the second row.
Only that star is enclosed in the marquee.
It has not been included in the group yet.
&lt;Shift&gt;+click on one of the grouped stars to include the group to the "group of one." The bounding box encloses the two top rows of stars and includes a smaller box highlighting the one "special star." 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/AddingToTheGroup3.gif" alt="Adding a star to a group of three" class="lazy">
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.
Click outside the box and then click on the third star in the second row.
The box now encloses the top two rows of stars, indicating that the last star you included is now part of the group.
You have created groups within groups.
This is a common technique used when designing artwork, but can be confusing when editing existing files where grouping has been used.
Choose the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) and click on any one of the grouped stars.
They all become selected.
Click off the stars to a blank area on the artboard to deselect them.
Ungroup items by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup.
Note that you will have to repeat this action for each of the groups created.
In other words, to get these back to individual stars, we have to choose <u>U</u>ngroup four times.
<b>Note:</b> Read Tutorial 7, “Working with Layers.” If you have a complex setup of nested groups and want to ungroup just one item, you can locate and select that item much more easily using layers, and you don’t have to ungroup.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">The Edit Path by Nodes Tool</span></h2>
There are instances when you want to select and manipulate specific line segments and nodes without affecting other paths and nodes in an object.
You can with the Edit Path by Nodes Tool (Node tool, for short).
In this part of the tutorial, you will select certain points on the stars in the top row of stars used in the last example, and manipulate them.
Before you start, you need to know that regular geometric shapes, such as the stars, are described internally by scalable vector equations that need only the positions of one inner and one outer point (node) to fully determine the shape of the star.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/StarAnatomy.gif" alt="Anatomy of a star showing nodes" class="lazy">
To manipulate individual paths and nodes on a star, or other type of regular polygon for that matter, you need to strip the star or polygon of its original equations so that it is represented internally as a series of individual paths and nodes.
The original describing equations are eliminated, so there is no previous computer knowledge of what the shape was.
With this new internal representation, you can now change the position of individual nodes.
Click on <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen and open the <b>Tutorial02Image01.svg</b> file you downloaded earlier.
Marquee select the three stars in the top row.

The top 3 stars appearing as paths and nodes Click on the top point of the third selected star and drag it to the right.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/DraggingPointToTheRight.gif" alt="Dragging a single star point to the right" class="lazy">
Note how the selected node turns red, indicating that it is active.
When you release the left mouse button and move the cursor off the node, it turns blue to indicate that it is still active and ready to be moved.
Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo: Move nodes to undo your latest action of repositioning the star point.
Click on the white background to deselect the stars.
Now click on the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) and reselect the top three stars.
Click on the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Path by Nodes tool" width="26">).
Note how the stars now show nodes at all inner and outer points.
Using the Node tool, drag a marquee around the top points of the three selected stars.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/GroupSelectingWithEditPathsTool.gif" alt="Group selecting with the Edit Paths tool" class="lazy">
Release the left mouse button.
The selected points are now colored blue, indicating that they are now active.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/TopPointsSelected.gif" alt="Top points of stars selected" class="lazy">
Drag the top point of the right-most star to a new location.
See how all the selected top points move in parallel with the one node you are moving.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/GroupMove.gif" alt="Group moving nodes" class="lazy">
Experiment by clicking (and &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking ) on different nodes and moving them around.
This grouping technique is handy when you need to move one or more parts of one or more items the same distance in the same direction.
You can also select more than one node by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the nodes with the Node tool.
When you use this technique, select your items with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path, click on the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Path by Nodes tool" width="26">), use the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Path by Nodes tool" width="26">) to select the nodes you want to manipulate, and move the nodes as you need.
If you don’t like the positioning, you can always choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo: your latest action.
A quick alternative to using the Edit menu is to press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z, the shortcut key, to undo your last action.
(Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z multiple times to undo multiple actions.) 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Applying Selection Techniques</span></h2>
In this next part of the tutorial, you will use some of the techniques discussed as well as several others.
Download the art file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/Doggie_pieces.svg"><b>Doggie_pieces.svg</b></a> to your computer.
Make sure that the entire canvas is visible by pressing the <b>4</b> key (the shortcut key for the <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; <u>D</u>rawing command).
On the right you see the completed project, on the left are the objects needed to create the finished dog.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/Doggie_pieces.gif" alt="Pieces of a cartoon dog" class="lazy">
Start this lesson by hiding the Command bar, Tools Control bar, Toolbox, and color palette; you won’t need them for this part of the tutorial.
Hold down &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+p to hide the palette, or hide the Commands bar, Tools Control bar, Toolbox, and color palette individually using the <u>V</u>iew &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide submenu.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), select the brownish-red circle.
To avoid grabbing a bounding box handle and resizing the circle, click and drag the center of the circle to slide it to its new location as the nose of the dog.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), drag both ears, the tuft of hair, and the mouth into position.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/DoggieHalfwayThere.gif" alt="Doggie cartoon halfway constructed" class="lazy">
Use the Select tool to move parts into place.
<b>Note</b>: Be careful with the mouth.
It contains two objects, so with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), &lt;Shift&gt;+click to select the top and bottom objects, and move them together.
Select the dog’s head (light brown shape), choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click the Lock checkbox to keep the head in position.
Click outside the bounding box to turn it off.
You will not be able to select the dog’s head until you choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unlock All.
Leave it locked for now.
You are using the solid arrow, or Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), to activate an entire object and move it.
Each object that you select is made up of several anchor points.
To activate these anchor points individually, switch to the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">).
Click on the anchor point in the first peak, or tuft, of hair.
When the individual point is selected, it appears as a solid red diamond (active), whereas the other anchor points are gray diamonds (inactive).
When you move the Node tool off the active node, the node’s color changes to blue, indicating that it’s still selected but not currently active.
Click and drag the individual anchor point to change its position.

The eye is made of several parts.
Use either the marquee selection technique or the &lt;Shift&gt; key to select all three parts of the eye.
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.
Drag the eye into a position on the face to create a left eye.
While still pressing the left mouse button (don’t release it yet), press the space bar once.
The eye is copied and can now be dragged to a new location.
Drag the selected eye to the right to clone the left eye and position it as the right eye.
Release the mouse button.
The dog now has two eyes.
<b>Note</b>: If you also hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key when cloning, the newly cloned object is constrained and snaps to a straight, 90°, or 180° angle.
Also, if you need to create a multitude of similar objects, you can first click on the original object to select it but do not release the mouse button.
Drag the mouse along and tap on the space bar to create copies of the original object.
You can adjust their position later.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Hiding Selections</span></h2>
As you create more complicated artwork, existing objects may get in the way and make it difficult to make selections.
A good technique when designing in Inkscape is to Hide selected artwork, which can be done by selecting an object with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and clicking on the Hide checkbox in the Object Properties dialog.
A hidden object can not be moved or selected; it is essentially as though that object no longer exists on the canvas.
Bring all hidden objects back at the same time by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Advanced Selection Techniques</span></h2>
When working on complex artwork, selections may become more difficult to control.
In this tutorial, we combine some of the tutorials already covered with some additional features that will make selecting the correct items easier.
Download file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/AlleenMaarDeBesteFriten.svg"><b>AlleenMaarDeBesteFriten.svg</b></a> to your computer.
Have the Fill and Stroke dialog panel open.
If it isn’t visible, choose Window &gt; Fill and Stroke.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/AlleenMaarDeFriten.gif" alt="Just the French fries" class="lazy">
Note that the large words, <b>DE BESTE FRITEN</b>, cover and make it difficult to select items underneath.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), select the words, <b>DE BESTE FRITEN</b>, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click on the Hide checkbox in the Object Properties dialog.
The words will come back in the exact same location when we choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All at the end of the tutorial.
If the text <b>DE BEST FRITEN</b> in the figure above looks different from what you see on your computer, the particular font used might not be installed.
If you want to use this particular font, download it from this link, <a href="Poetica_Chancery_I.ttf">Poetica Chancery</a> or from this Web site at <a href="https://best-font.com/fonts/download-poetica-chancery-i-font.html">Best-Font.com</a>.
This Web site is one of many that have Poetica Chancery available for download.
Install the font on your computer, exit from Inkscape and then restart it, so Inkscape can see and use it.
Poetica Chancery is an elegant decorative font used to enhance the attractiveness of many a graphical piece of artwork.
You might find ample opportunity to use it as you develop your typographical skills and sense and sensibility of using typographical design.
Changing the fill of all the yellow stars to white could be time-consuming, but using the <b>Edit Same</b> feature reduces the trouble.
Select any one yellow star and then choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; Select Sa<u>m</u>e &gt; Fill <u>a</u>nd Stroke.
All the other stars become selected.
Make sure that the fill box is forward in the toolbar and select white from the Color palette at the bottom of the screen.
The stars all change to white.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/WhiteStars.gif" alt="Yellow stars changed to white" class="lazy">
Select one of the shapes creating the French fries and then choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; Select Sa<u>m</u>e &gt; <u>S</u>troke Color.
The french fry shape has a black-colored stroke so all strokes that are black are now activated.
Using the <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>F</u>ill and Stroke… &gt; Stroke style palette, type <b>5</b> into the <u>W</u>idth textbox to increase the line weight to 5 pt (make sure the units of measurement are points) and press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the value.
Click in an empty area to deselect the artwork.
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All to bring back the words <b>DE BESTE FRITEN</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/Friten5ptBordersWhiteStars.gif" alt="Finished project" class="lazy">
Save and close the file.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Exploring on Your Own</span></h2>
Experiment with shapes by creating a shape object, circle, star, rectangle, or whatever you like.
Clone it several times.
Apply different colors and strokes to the shapes and reselect them using the <b>Select Sa<u>m</u>e</b> menu item.
Try cloning multiple items at the same time.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Quiz</span></h2>
Why might an object that has no fill not become selected when you click on it? How do you edit the shape of an object? If something is blocking your view of a selection what can you do? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
Items that have no fill must be selected by clicking on their stroke (border).
Using the Edit paths by nodes tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Path by Nodes tool" width="26">), you can select one or more individual anchor points and make changes to the shape of an object.
If something is blocking your access to a selection, you can choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click on the Hide checkbox in the Object Properties dialog.
The object is not deleted, just hidden in the same position until you choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All.

If you like, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt; Zoom Out (<b>-</b>) to make the finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen as you work.
Move the artwork where you want it in the window using the &lt;Shift&gt;+arrow keys.
If you don't want to leave the image open, choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>C</u>lose.
Now create the start file to begin the lesson.
Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>N</u>ew to open a new, untitled document.
Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s…, name the file <b>Logo</b>, and navigate to the folder where you want to store the file using the Save In menu.
Leave the default file format as <b>Inkscape SVG (*.svg)</b>.
Inkscape will automatically append the filename with <b>.svg</b> as it saves.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Setting up the Document</span></h2>
You’ll begin this tutorial by displaying a grid to use as a guideline for drawing, setting the ruler units to inches, closing the color palette and Command toolbar that you won’t use, opening the Snap Controls bar to adjust the positioning of objects.
Close the color palette by pressing &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+p or choosing View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Palette.
To close the Commands toolbar, choose View &gt; Show/Hide &lt; Commands Bar.
For now, you won’t need to use it.
Choose View &gt; Page Grid to display a grid that’s useful for measuring, drawing, and aligning shapes.
The grid won’t print with the artwork.
If the rulers are not visible along the top and left side of the window, choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Rulers to display them.
The ruler units are set by default to pixels.
You can change ruler units for the current document.
The ruler unit of measure applies to measuring objects, moving and transforming objects, setting grid and guide spacing, and creating ellipses and rectangles.
(It does not affect the units in the Character, Paragraph, and Stroke palettes.) Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>D</u>ocument Properties.

When Inkscape is launched, the Snap Controls Bar is activated automatically.
Snapping in the figure above is enabled.
If you need to deactivate it to prevent automatic snapping of objects to anything, click on the topmost (or leftmost) icon in the bar (<b>Enable snapping (%)</b>).
All subordinate icons will also deactivate.
We’ll discuss more about the Snap Controls Bar later.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Using Basic Shape Tools</span></h2>
In this tutorial, you’ll create a simple logo using the basic shape tools in the toolbox.
The shape tools include the: <b>Create rectangles and squares tool</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/images/RectangleTool.gif" alt="Create Squares tool" width="26">), <b>Create circles, ellipses, and arcs tool</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/images/EllipseTool.gif" alt="Create Circles tool" width="26">), and <b>Create stars and polygons tool</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/images/CreateStarsTool.gif" alt="Create Stars tool" width="26">).
To reduce bulky prose, we’ll call these tools the Rectangle tool, Ellipse tool, and Polygon or Star tool, respectively.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing the Pencil Shape</span></h2>
In Inkscape, you control the thickness and color of lines that you draw by setting stroke attributes.
A stroke is the paint characteristics of a line or the outline of an object.
A fill is the paint characteristics of the inside of an object.
The default settings will let you see the objects you draw with a white fill and a black outline.
Select the Zoom tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom tool" width="26">) in the toolbox, and click in the middle of the window once or twice until you are zoomed in to about 150%.
(Notice that 150%, more or less, is displayed in the bottom left corner of the window.) Choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; G<u>u</u>ides to turn them on.
<b>Guides</b> automatically snap the edges of objects to nearby objects or their intersect points as you move them.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">How Guides Work</span></h2>
When the <b>Guides</b> feature is turned on and you move the cursor over your artwork, the cursor looks for objects, page boundaries, and intersections of construction guides to snap to that are within the tolerance range set in <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>D</u>ocument Properties &gt; Snap tab.
You can use <b>Guides</b> in the following ways when you create, move, and transform objects.
When you create an object with the pen or shape tools, use the <b>Guides</b> to position the new object’s anchor points relative to the other object.
When you move an object, use the <b>Guides</b> to align to the point on the object that you have selected.
You can align to the anchor point at the corner of a selected object near the bounding box.
To do so, select the object just inside the bounding box handle.
If the tolerance is 5 pixels or greater, you can snap to the corner point from 5 pixels away.
When you transform an object, <b>Guides</b> appear to assist the transformation.
Note: When <b>Snap to Grid</b> is turned on, you cannot use <b>Guides</b> (even if the menu command is selected).
Select the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/images/RectangleTool.gif" alt="Create Squares tool" width="26">), and drag it to draw a rectangle that's 0.75 inches wide and 1 inch tall.
(Use the rulers and the grid as guides.) This will be the body of the pencil.

Drag to draw first rectangle When you release the left mouse button, the rectangle is automatically selected and eight sizing handles appear on its bounding box.
To move the rectangle, you will need to put the cursor on the border of the rectangle and then drag it to its new location.
Trying to move it by dragging on its interior will have no effect unless it has a color fill.
Note the rectangle’s width (<b>W</b>) and height (<b>H</b>) in the Tool Controls bar:

Click on the rectangle’s border if it isn't still selected.
Then, click in the <b>W</b> (width) box and change the measurement to <b>.75</b>.
Do the same with the <b>H</b> (height) box, changing the measurement to <b>1</b>.
The rectangle’s dimensions will update accordingly.
You’ll draw another rectangle centered inside the first one to represent the two vertical lines on the pencil.
With the Rectangle tool still selected, position the pointer over the center point of the rectangle, hold down the &lt;Shift&gt; key, and drag out from the center point to draw a rectangle that's centered inside it.
Release the mouse button when the rectangle is the same height as the first rectangle (1 inch).
If the unit of measurement is not in inches (<b>in</b>), click in that box and choose <b>in</b> from the drop-down menu.
In the width (<b>W</b>) box, change the measurement to 0.42 so the inner rectangle won’t appear unnecessarily broad.
Holding down &lt;Shift&gt; as you drag the Rectangle tool draws the rectangle from its center point rather than from its top left corner.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Quiz</span></h2>
What are the basic shape tools? How do you draw a square? How do you select the color fill of an object? How do you select the stroke color of an object? What is the difference between a View grid and a grid drawn with the Grid extension tool? How do you rescale an object so that it scales up or down proportionately? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
The basic shape tools are the Rectangle tool, Circle tool, Polygon tool, and the Spiral tool.
Select the Rectangle tool, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;, and drag to create the square.
Select your object and, while the object is still selected, click on the desired color in the Color palette.
The interior of the object is colored with that particular color.
The stroke color is not affected.
Select your object and, while the object is still selected, &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the desired color in the Color palette.
The exterior boundary of the object is colored with that particular color.
The fill color is not affected.
The View grid acts as a guiding tool that you can use for precision placement of an object, including snapping.
The View grid does not print with the artwork.
A grid made with the Grid extension tool does print.
To rescale an object proportionately, hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; and click-drag with the mouse to resize.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating Straight Lines</span></h2>
In Tutorial 3, you discovered that using the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key in combination with shape tools constrains the shape of objects you create using Inkscape.
This is also true with the Pen tool.
Using the Pen tool with the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key constrains the paths you create to angles that are multiples of 15°.
In this part of the lesson, you will learn how to draw straight lines.
Download and open file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/Tutorial04Image02.svg"><b>Tutorial04Image02.svg</b></a>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating Curved Paths</span></h2>
In this part of the lesson, you’ll learn how to draw smooth, curved lines with the Pen tool.
In vector-drawing programs such as Inkscape, you can draw a curve, called a Bézier curve, using control points.
By setting anchor points and dragging direction handles (controls), you can define the shape of the curve.
Although drawing curves this way takes some getting used to, it gives you the greatest control and flexibility in creating paths.
Before we get started with a lesson file, choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>N</u>ew to create a new document in Inkscape.
Click on the Zoom icon in the toolbox ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In or Out icon" width="26">) and then click on the Zoom to Fit Page (5) icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/ZoomToFit.gif" alt="Zoom to fit icon" width="26">) in the toolbar that appears when you click on the Zoom icon.

Click and drag to create a curved path.
Continue clicking and dragging at various locations on the page.
The goal for this exercise is not to create anything specific, but to get you accustomed to the feel of the Bézier curve.
Notice that as you click and drag, direction handles appear that end in round direction points.
The angle and length of the direction handles determine the shape and size of the curved segments.
Direction lines do not print and are not visible when the anchor is inactive.
Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; D<u>e</u>select.
Choose the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">) and select a curved segment to display the direction handles again.
Moving the direction points reshapes the curves.
<i><b>Note:</b> Endpoints are diamond-shaped, and, when selected, appear red when the cursor is on them, blue when the cursor is off them; unselected, they appear grey.
Anchor points in the middle of a line or curve segment are squares.
Like segment endpoints, they are red when selected and the cursor is on them, blue when selected and the cursor is off them.
Direction points are circles.
These lines and points do not print with the artwork.</i>

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Components of a Path</h3>
A smooth anchor point always has two direction handles that move together as a single, straight unit.
When you drag the direction anchor point of either direction line on a smooth anchor point, both direction handles move simultaneously, maintaining a continuous curve at that anchor point.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/CurvedPathAnatomy.gif" alt="Anatomy of a curved path" class="lazy">
<b>A.</b> Anchor point.
<b>B.</b> Direction line.
<b>C.</b> Direction point (or handle).
In comparison, a corner point can have two, one, or no direction handles, depending on whether it joins two, one, or no curved segments, respectively.
Corner point direction handles maintain the corner by using different angles.
When you drag a direction point on a corner point's direction line, the other direction line, if present, does not move.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Building a Curve</span></h2>
In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to control the direction handles in order to control curves.

When you release the mouse and move the cursor
away from the direction line, the direction line stays put.
<i><b>Note:</b> The artboard might scroll as you drag the anchor point.
If you lose visibility of the curve, you can roll the mouse wheel to move your artwork up or down, or &lt;Shift&gt;-roll the mouse wheel to move your work left or right, or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-roll the mouse wheel to magnify or demagnify your work to bring the path back into view.</i> Click on the lower right base of the arch path and drag down.

What you created is an open path; now you are going to create the second path on this page.
If you click with the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Pen tool" width="26">) while the original path is still active, the path will connect.
To avoid doing this, right-click or press &lt;Enter&gt;.
Click and drag at the left base of path "B," again in the direction of the arch.
Click and drag down on the next square point, adjusting the arch with the direction handle before you release the mouse.
Don’t worry if it is not exact; you can correct this with the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">) when the path is complete.

If you make a mistake as you draw, you can undo your work by choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo or by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z.
Inkscape, by default, lets you undo a series of actions — limited only by your computer’s memory — by repeatedly choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo or pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z.
<i><b>Tip:</b> You have the ability to undo and redo multiple times in Inkscape.

<i>Keep the following guidelines in mind to help you draw any kind of curve quickly and easily:</i> <i>Always drag the first direction point in the direction of the bump of the curve, and drag the second direction point in the opposite direction to create a single curve.
Dragging both direction points in the same direction creates an S curve.</i> <i>When drawing a series of continuous curves, draw one curve at a time, placing anchor points at the beginning and end of each curve, not at the tip of the curve.</i> <i>Use as few anchor points as possible, placing them as far apart as possible.</i>

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Painting the Artwork</h3>
Now paint the objects as you like.
You will use the <b>Style Indicator</b>, which is an area in the lower left corner of the window containing the Fill Box, Stroke Box, Stroke thickness, and Opacity.
In the color illustration at the beginning of this tutorial, the stroke on the leaf, the stem, and the pear have been removed, and the fills were created with custom-made gradients.
The arrow is given a dark blue color.
Details were drawn on the leaf, the stem, and the round part of the pear using the paintbrush tool and the Pen tool.
We also stroked the curve where the arrow pierces the pear.
Move the cursor to the Color palette.
With the mouse wheel, roll the palette right or left until you see your color of choice.
Click on the Color box, click-drag it down and drop it in the <b>Fill</b> box of the <b>Style Indicator</b>.
Your object is filled with that color.
Alternatively, you can select the object you want to color-fill and just click on the box containing the color you want.
For example: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/DragColorIntoFillBox.gif" alt="Drag your color of choice into the Fill Box" class="lazy">
Dragging your color of choice into the Fill box of the Style Indicator.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/ColorFilledArrowhead.gif" alt="Arrowhead filled with dark blue" class="lazy">
Arrowhead filled with dark blue.
Now drag your color of choice down and drop it on the <b>Stroke</b> box of the Style Indicator to change the stroke color of a selected object.
Because you applied dark blue to your object in the previous step, the Fill box is dark blue.
The Fill and Stroke boxes can be very handy in showing you the color status of a selected object and manipulating its color.

Stroke color box is now dark blue.
The <b>1.5</b> next to the Stroke color box indicates the thickness of the stroke in pixels.
The <b>O</b> next to the <b>100</b> stands for the <b>opacity</b> (the opposite of transparency) of the selected object.
The selected object is currently 100% opaque.
Using the Opacity box allows you to set the degree of transparency from totally transparent (0%) to totally opaque (100%).
<b>Note:</b> The None color box ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/NoneColorBox.gif" alt="None color box" class="center">) is a buggy feature.
It works well if you want to delete a fill color.
However, if you want to delete a stroke, you need to &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the None box.
I recommend that you memorize this technique.
It can come in very handy when you are manipulating both shape and color of an object.

You’ve completed this tutorial on drawing straight lines and curves.
For additional practice with the Pen tool, try tracing over images with it.
As you practice more with the Pen tool, you'll become more adept at drawing the kinds of curves and shapes you want.
If you want to duplicate the colors in the pear logo at the beginning of this lesson, try your hand at using the Color palette to find and use a fill color.
To explore the brush strokes in the logo, look at <u>H</u>elp &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; Comprehensive Index &gt; C &gt; Calligraphy Tool &gt; Predefined and custom presets.
<i><b>Tip:</b> Because this tutorial does not cover all the Inkscape tools and techniques possible, please spend time with the Inkscape Manual to find out what else is available to you as your expertise grows.

Attributes</b> in the Table of Contents.
Experiment with the tools and techniques the <b>Fill and Stroke Paint</b> and <b>Stroke Style</b> sections present.</i> 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Exploring on Your Own</span></h2>
Now that you've used the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Pen tool" width="26">) to draw a pear with precise Bézier curves, try drawing the pear using the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Pencil tool" width="26">) to create a hand-drawn look.
You can edit lines that you draw using the Pencil tool and Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">) to change their shape, and you can use the Pencil tool Tool Controls bar, Path Simplify command, and Erase Existing Paths tool to edit the drawing further.
Open the <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/PearParts.svg"><b>PearParts.svg</b></a> file again and save it as <b>Pear2.svg</b>.
Select the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Pencil tool" width="26">) in the toolbox, and draw the pear on one continuous path without releasing the mouse button.
To close the path, click-drag the Pencil tool cursor to the starting point, which is a small open square.
The starting square will get a red fill when the cursor hovers above it, signaling that you can now close the path.
Release the left mouse button.
The path turns into a solid black path inside a bounding box.
Anchor points are set down as you draw with the Pencil tool, and you can adjust them once the path is complete.
The number of anchor points is determined by the length and complexity of the path and by the tolerance value set in the Inkscape Pencil tool Tool Controls bar.
In the figure below, the smoothness tolerance is set to <b>10</b>.
The Inkscape default value for the smoothness tolerance is <b>4</b>.
The higher the number, the smoother the curve; the lower the number, the more irregular the curve.
Note that the Smooth text box displays a percentage bar to show you graphically the degree of smoothness that will be applied to your curve.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/PencilToolControlBar.gif" alt="Pencil tool control bar" class="lazy">
Pencil tool control bar.
Smoothness tolerance is set to <b>10</b>.
Use the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Pencil tool" width="26">) redraw the shape of the pear with different tolerance settings.
Note how finely the pear path is defined with many anchor points at smoothness setting <b>10</b>, compared to a redrawing done with a smoothness setting <b>20</b>.
An alternative to smoothing a rough-drawn path is the Simplify Path command.
Use <u>P</u>ath &gt; Si<u>m</u>plify or press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L.
One application of the Simplify Path command to the left-most drawing reduces the number of anchor points significantly, as you can see below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/PencilToolSettings.gif" alt="Pencil tool settings" class="lazy">
Pencil tool results from different tolerance settings and one application of the Simplify command (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-L).
Plain paths are shown in the top row, corresponding paths with nodes are shown in the bottom row.

Simplify Path command applied twice on an open path.
Depending on where you begin to redraw a path and in which direction you drag, you might get unexpected results.
For example, you might unintentionally change a closed path to an open path, change on open path to a closed path, or lose a portion of a shape.
You can always undo a mistake by choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo or using the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z short-cut key combination.
Use the Simplify Path command (<u>P</u>ath &gt; Si<u>m</u>plify or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L) to round out the shape of a curved segment (deleting anchor points if necessary).
The number of anchor points is determined by the length and complexity of the new path, as well as by the smoothness tolerance values set in the Pencil tool Control bar (see 2.
above).

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Smoothing the Path with the Simplify Path command (<u>P</u>ath &gt; Si<u>m</u>plify or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L)</h3>
The Simplify Path command lets you smooth out an existing stroke or path.
The Simplify Path command retains the original shape of the path as much as possible.

<h4>To use the Simplify Path command:</h4>
If the path you wish to smooth is not selected, select it with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">).
Do one of the following: Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; Si<u>m</u>plify.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L (or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-l), the command is case-insensitive).
Continue choosing <u>P</u>ath &gt; Si<u>m</u>plify or pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L (or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-l) until the stroke or path has the desired smoothness.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/SimplifyPathAppliedThrice.gif" alt="Simplify path command applied three times" class="lazy">
Simplify Path command applied three times on an open path.
Note how the number of anchor points steadily decreases with each application.
Use the Delete Segment between Two Non-Endpoint Nodes tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/DeleteSegmentBetween2NonEndpointNodes.gif" alt="Delete segment between two non-endpoint nodes icon" width="26">) in the Edit Nodes toolbar to delete segments on the path of the pear, then redraw them using the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Pencil tool" width="26">).

<h4>Erasing a Path with the Delete Segment between Two Non-Endpoint Nodes tool
<h4> </h4>
</h4>
The Delete Segment between Two Non-Endpoint Nodes tool (Delete Segment tool, for short) ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/DeleteSegmentBetween2NonEndpointNodes.gif" alt="Delete segment between two non-endpoint nodes icon" width="26">) lets you remove a portion of an existing path or stroke.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
Describe how to draw straight vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines using the Pen tool.
How do you draw a curved line using the Pen tool? How do you draw a corner point on a curved line? How do you change a smooth point on a curve to a corner point? Which tool would you use edit a segment on a curved line? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review answers</span></h2>
To draw a straight line, you click twice with the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Pen tool" width="26">) — the first click sets the starting anchor point, and the second click sets the ending anchor point of the line.
To constrain the line vertically, horizontally, or along a 45° diagonal, hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; as you click with the Pen tool.
To draw a curved line using the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Pen tool" width="26">), you hold down the left mouse button and click-drag to create the starting anchor point and set the direction of the curve, and then you click to end the curve.
To draw a corner point on a curved line, click on the ending point of your first curve.
Click-drag the direction handle on the endpoint of the curve to fine-tune the direction of the path.
Either right-click or press &lt;Enter&gt; to finalize the curve segment.
Then click on the endpoint and click-drag the cursor in the direction the next curve segment will take.
Move the cursor to the next endpoint without click-dragging to draw the next curve.
Use the Edit paths by nodes tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">) to select the anchor point, and then click on the Make Selected Nodes Corner icon  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/MakeSelectedNodesCornerIcon.gif" alt="Make selected nodes corner icon" width="26">) in the toolbar.
&lt;Shift&gt;-drag a direction handle from the node to change the direction of one of the curves.
If both curves have different starting angles, &lt;Shift&gt;-drag the mouse to create a direction handle for each side of the cusp.
To edit a segment on a curved line, select the Edit paths by nodes tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">) and drag the segment to move it, or drag a direction handle on an anchor point to adjust the length and shape of the segment.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Filling with Color</span></h2>
Painting objects with colors, gradients, or patterns is done using a combination of palettes and tools — including the Color palette, the Swatches palette, the Gradient palette, the Stroke palette, and the paint buttons in the toolbox — that let you select and change an object’s paint and line attributes.
You’ll begin by filling an object with color.
Filling an object paints the area enclosed by the path.
The Color palette appears automatically on-screen when starting Inkscape.
(If the Color palette isn’t visible, display it by choosing <u>V</u>iew &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide &gt; <u>P</u>alette; a check mark indicates that the palette is open on-screen.)

The squiggly shape now has no fill.
The Fill box now has no fill (a fill of “None”), and the Stroke box has a pale green color.
(The color will become apparent in the next step.) With a fill of None, you can see through to the fill underneath – in this case, the gray color of the rectangle’s fill.
Now you’ll change the weight of the curve that you just stroked using the <b>Stroke style</b> palette.
<i>Stroke weight</i> is the thickness of a line.
The <b>Stroke style</b> palette is grouped with the <b>Fill</b> and <b>Stroke paint</b> palettes.
The green curve has a weight of 1 pixel.
With the squiggly shape still selected, click on the <b>Stroke style</b> tab.
If the shape has been deselected, then the features in the <b>Stroke style</b> palette will be appear grey and unhighlighted.
Click on the curve to reselect it, if this is the case.
Features in the <b>Stroke palette</b> become highlighted, and thus active.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Building Custom Swatches</span></h2>
You’ll start to create a custom color using the CMYK sliders in the Color palette.
First you’ll mix a fill color.
In the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> palette, click the <b>Fill</b> tab to make it active, if it isn’t already.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), click the middle of the hat in the bottom left rectangle to select it.

<b>Fill</b> palette for the middle part
of the lower left hat.
In the <b>Fill</b> palette, notice that the hat color is grayscale – that is, a percentage of black – and only the K (black) slider shows a value.
The color bar changes to display a scale ramp from white to black.
The other colors have a <b>0</b> value.
Now you’ll mix colors using the CMYK color model.
The <b>Fill</b> and <b>Stroke paint</b> palettes let you edit and mix colors – either colors that you create or colors that you have selected from a Swatches palette, from an object, or from a color library.
In this case, you’re selecting colors using the CMYK color model.
In the <b>Fill</b> palette, drag the CMYK sliders to select a light orange color, or type values in the text boxes and press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; to apply the changes.
(We specified C = 0%, M = 25%, Y = 54%, and B = 0%.)

You can use the different color models in conjunction with the Color palette sliders to precisely select a color by its different color values.
However, if you mix color models (such as CMYK and RGB) in the same file, Inkscape will convert the colors to the RGB mode in which the file is saved, RGB being Inkscape’s native color storage mode.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Saving and Naming a Color Swatch</span></h2>
The <b>Swatch</b> palette stores the colors, gradients, and patterns that have been preloaded into Inkscape, as well as those you create and save for reuse.
New colors added to the <b>Swatch</b> palette are saved with the current file.
Opening a new artwork file displays the default set of swatches that comes with the Inkscape program.
You will now add the light orange color you just mixed to the <b>Swatch</b> palette so it will be stored with this artwork file.
You can select a color to add from either the <b>Fill</b> or <b>Stroke paint</b> palettes.
Even though you deselected the artwork, the light orange color is still the current color in the <b>Fill</b> box in both the Style Indicator and the Fill palette.
If the artwork is deselected, select the orange area you just created in the middle of the lower left hat.
Note how the Style Indicator and Fill palette change to reflect the color status of the orange area.

If you create a series of new colors that are subtley different from each other, naming them in an organized way can help you keep track of them in your custom swatches palette.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Copying Paint Attributes</span></h2>
Inkscape lets you copy paint attributes of objects (such as their fill and stroke colors) in various ways and apply the attributes to other objects.
You’ll use the Dropper tool to copy colors from your artwork into the <b>Fill</b> palette.
Also called <i>sampling</i>, copying colors lets you replicate paint attributes even when you don’t know their exact values.
In the bottom left rectangle, click the gray top of the hat with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) to highlight it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SelectHatTop.gif" alt="Hat top selected" class="lazy">

Select the Dropper tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/PickColorFromImage.gif" alt="Eyedropper pointer" width="26">) in the <b>Fill</b> palette.
The highlighting arrows around the top of the hat disappear temporarily.
By default, the Dropper tool samples the color fill and stroke attributes of an object.
<b>Note:</b> the Dropper tool is not active when an object is not selected.
Once an object to be painted or repainted is selected, the Dropper tool is active and ready for color sampling.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Copying Appearance Attributes</span></h2>
Inkscape lets you copy appearance attributes that include both the fill and the stroke of an object as well as its transparency and effects.
You’ll create a drop shadow shape and change its transparency.
Then you’ll apply the shadow's appearance to another shape.
Select the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) in the toolbox, and click the hat brim in the upper right rectangle.
With the hat brim selected, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-d to make a copy of the brim (think <b>d</b> for <b>d</b>uplicate), and drag the copy slightly down and to the right.
Release the mouse button to leave a copy of the hat brim.
This copy will become a drop shadow.
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>L</u>ower 5 times to move the shadow shape underneath the hat brim.
You should still be able to see both the shadow shape and the hat brim.
<b>Note:</b> Pressing the &lt;page down&gt; key will also lower the hat brim in the figure stacking order.
It’s a good feature to memorize.
With the object (in this case, the hat’s shadow) still selected, use the Stroke paint palette to change its stroke to <b>None</b> by clicking on the <b>No paint</b> icon.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/NoPaintIcon.gif" alt="No paint icon" class="lazy">

Using the <b>Opacity (%)</b> control at the bottom of the <b>Fill</b> palette, change the shadow shape’s transparency from 100% to 50%.
You can type <b>50</b> at the right end of the slider bar and press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the transparency, or drag the slider bar indicator to 50.0 using the mouse.
If you choose to use the slider bar indicator, note how the cursor pointer changes from an arrowhead to an upward-pointing stylized arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/UpwardPointingArrow.gif" alt="Upward-pointing arrow">).

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Saturating a Color</span></h2>
Next, you’ll adjust the saturation of the new color you added to the hat’s top by changing the percentage of black in the color.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), click the top of the hat in the bottom left rectangle to select it.

in the color mix.
Adjusting the saturation lets you change the strength of a color without affecting the hue.
(However, if you drag a slider that is set to 0%, you will change the hue or color of the object, rather than the color’s saturation.) Click away from the artwork, and choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>S</u>ave.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Painting with Patterns</span></h2>
In addition to process and spot colors, you can also create your own pattern swatches.
Inkscape provides features with which you can create your own patterns.
Now you’ll fill some objects with a pattern, working with the hat in the top right rectangle.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), click in the center of the hat ribbon shape in the top right rectangle.
The Fill box in the Attribute box shows that the shape’s current fill is a very light yellow (<b>Y</b> = <b>4</b>).

We will now create a new Inkscape-style repeating pattern from an a previously made <b>.svg</b> file.
Download and open file <a href="Colorfetti.svg"><b>Colorfetti.svg</b></a>.
You now have two Inkscape workspaces open, one containing the Colorfetti pattern and the other, the collection of four hats.

With the Colorfetti image still selected, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Patter<u>n</u> &gt; Objects to Patter<u>n</u>.
You’ll see the bounding box handles flicker as the image is converted into a pattern and stored in the Pattern Swatch library.
You can now use the Colorfetti image as a fill pattern.
The <b>Pattern fill</b> palette appears in the Fill palette after you choose Objects to Patter<u>n</u>.
The pattern is given a label.
Here, it is <b>pattern14155</b>.

(Background hasn’t been deselected yet.) The new pattern swatch that you created exists only for this workspace.
If you want to use this pattern in another image file, you will have to copy the original <b>.svg</b> image into your workspace just as you did earlier here, and transform it from an object into a pattern by using <u>O</u>bject &gt; Patter<u>n</u> &gt; Objects to Patter<u>n</u>.
Then you can use it as a fill pattern.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
To fill an object with color, select the object and the <b>Fill</b> or <b>Stroke paint</b> tab in the <b>Fill and Stroke paint</b> palette.
Then do one of the following: Click a color in the color bar in the Color palette.
Drag the color sliders or type in values in the text boxes in the Fill palette.
Click a color swatch in the Swatches palette.
Select the Dropper pointer ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/PickColorFromImage.gif" alt="Eyedropper pointer" width="26">), and click a color in the artwork.
To name a color, click on the Swatch icon in the Fill palette ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial05/images/SwatchIcon.gif" alt="Swatch icon" width="26">).
Click in the Name field in the Swatch fill palette to highlight the number, type the name of the new color in the name field, and click away from the field to set the name.
To paint a shape with a transparent color, select the shape and fill it with any color.
Then adjust the <b>Opacity (%)</b> control at the bottom of the <b>Fill</b> or <b>Stroke paint</b> palette to less than 100%.
To desaturate a CMYK color, select the color and drag its slider to the left in the Fill or Stroke paint palette.
Dragging the slider causes the other sliders to move in tandem so the hue won’t change.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 6 – Working with Layers</span></h2>

Layers let you organize your work into distinct levels that can be edited and viewed as individual units.
Every Inkscape document contains at least one layer.
Creating multiple layers in your artwork lets you easily control how artwork is printed, displayed, and edited.

<h4>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: </h4>
Work with the Layers palette.
Create and name new layers and sublayers.
Move layers and sublayers to change their position in the layer stack.
Move objects between layers.
Lock layers to prevent editing.
Hide layers to make viewing and editing easier, and redisplay them.
Paste objects from another file into your artwork.
Create clipping masks to control how artwork is hidden or revealed.
Add an appearance attribute to a layer.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>

The artwork contains some of the basic objects for the clock illustration.
Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s, name the file <b>Clock.svg</b>, and save it in a convenient location.
Using the Layers palette, you can create multiple levels of artwork that reside on separate, overlapping layers, sublayers, and groups in the same file.
Layers act like individual, clear sheets containing one or more objects.
Where no filled (or nontransparent) objects overlap, you can see through any layer to the layer below.
You can create and edit objects on any layer without affecting the artwork on any other layer.
You can also display, print, lock, and reorder layers as distinct units.

Example of composite art and how layers break out 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating Layers</span></h2>
Every document in Inkscape contains one layer by default.
You can rename the layer and add more layers at any time as you create the artwork.
Placing objects on separate layers lets you easily select and edit them by their organization.
For example, by placing type on a separate layer, you can change the type all at once without affecting the rest of the artwork.
You’ll change the layer name to “Clock,” and then you’ll create another layer.
If the Layers palette isn’t visible on-screen, choose <u>L</u>ayer &gt; Layer<u>s</u> to display it.
Alternatively, you can click on the <b>View Layers</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/ViewLayersIcon.gif" alt="View Layers icon">) in the Commands Bar.

You can apply appearance attributes such as styles, effects, and transparency to layers, groups, and objects with the <b>Layers</b> palette.
When an appearance attribute is applied to a layer, any object on that layer will take on that attribute.
If an appearance attribute is applied only to a specific object on a layer, it affects only that object, not the entire layer.
You will apply an effect to an object on a layer.
Then you’ll copy that effect to a layer to change all objects on that layer.
In the <b>Layers</b> palette, collapse the <b>Face</b> layer and expand the <b>Frame</b> layer to reveal all its objects.
Right-click on any layer bar and choose <b>Lock all layers</b>.
Then, unlock the <b>Frame</b> layer and <b>Outer Lower Frame</b> sublayer.
You will apply an effect to the <b>Outer Lower Frame</b> sublayer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/CollapseFaceExpandFrame.gif" alt="Collapse the Face layer and expand the Frame layer." class="lazy">

Drop shadow.
You will now add drop shadows to the clock hands and numbers.
You will group the hands and numbers and copy them into their own layer and use the blur feature to make shadows out of them, and reposition them all as a group.
Rename the <b>Details</b> layer by double-clicking on the name and typing <b>Drop Shadows</b>.
Press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the name.
This layer should already be located below the <b>Numbers</b> and <b>Hands</b> layers.
This position indicates that the drop shadow objects are indeed located underneath the artwork’s original numbers and hands, giving an illusion of depth.
Lock all the layers except for the <b>Numbers</b>, <b>Hands</b>, and <b>Drop Shadow</b> layers.

Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save.
Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>C</u>lose to close the file.
You have completed building a layered file.
In some cases after the artwork is complete, you may want to place all the layers of art onto a single layer and delete the empty layers.
This is called flattening artwork.
Delivering finished artwork in a single layer file can prevent accidents, such as hiding layers, and not printing parts of the artwork, from happening.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Merging and Flattening Artwork</span></h2>
Merging and flattening are similar in that they let you consolidate paths, groups, and sublayers.
With merging, you can select which items you want to consolidate; with flattening, all visible items in the artwork are consolidated in a single, parent layer.
With either option, the stacking order of the artwork remains the same.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;To Merge Artwork into a Single Layer or Group:</h3>
Unlock just those layers that contain items you want to merge into one layer.
It is wise to have a new receptacle layer already created to put the selected items into.
Select the items that you want to merge in the <b>Layers</b> palette.
Marquee select your artwork and group (choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup) the items that are selected from the marquee select.
&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; or &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; to make the destination layer active.
At this point, the selected items are located in the destination layer.
Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; D<u>e</u>select or click off the selected artwork to deselect it.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;To Flatten Artwork:</h3>
Make sure that all the layers you want to flatten are visible.
Select the layer into which you will flatten the artwork or create a new destination layer.
You cannot flatten artwork into hidden, locked, or template layers.
They won’t accept incoming items.
Regardless of the layer you select, the options for the layer and the stacking order of the artwork don’t change.
Marquee select your artwork and group the items (choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup) that are selected from the marquee select into one object.
&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; or &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; to make the destination layer active.
At this point, all the items in the selected layers are located in the destination layer.
It might be wise to delete the original source layers.
Test each source layer against the flattened layer to verify that you do indeed have a copy of the original in the destination layer.
If you find a discrepancy between source and destination layers, either choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo or use the hot-key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z (case insensitive) to undo your most recent action or actions to help you troubleshoot.
If you find an error, you will be in a good position to resolve the graphics design error and maintain the integrity of your artwork.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
Name two benefits of using layrs when creating artwork.
How do you hide layers? Display individual layers? Describe how to reorder layers in a file.
How can you lock layers? How do you move objects from one layer to another? How do you create a layer clipping mask? How do you apply an effect to a layer? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review answers</span></h2>
Benefits of using layers when creating artwork include: You can protect artwork that you don’t want to change, you can hide artwork that you aren’t working with so that it’s not distracting, and you can control what prints.
To hide a layer, you click the eye icon The <b>Open Eye</b> icons ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/OpenEyeIcon.gif" alt="Open Eye icon" width="26">) to the left of the layer name.
To redisplay a layer, click the <b>Closed Eye</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/ClosedEyeIcon.gif" alt="Closed Eye icon" class="center" width="26">) to the left of the layer name.
You reorder layers by selecting a layer name in the <b>Layers</b> palette and dragging the layer to its new location.
You can also click on a layer to be moved to select it, and then click on the Up Arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/RaiseLayerBarArrow.gif" alt="Raise Layer Bar Arrow" width="26">) or Down Arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/LowerLayerBarArrow.gif" alt="Lower Layer Bar Arrow" width="26">) at the bottom of the <b>Layers</b> palette to move that layer up or down in the layer order.
The order of layers in the <b>Layers</b> palette controls the document’s layer order – topmost in the palette is frontmost in the artwork.
You can lock layers in a few different ways: You can choose Lock All Layers from the <b>Layers</b> palette menu to lock all layers.
You can choose Lock Others from the <b>Layers</b> palette menu to lock all layers but the active layer.
You can hide a layer to protect it.
Select the object you want to move.
Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; or &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; to highlight the layer bar of the destination layer.
Create a clipping mask on a layer by selecting the layer and then choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; Clip &gt; <u>S</u>et.
The topmost object in the layer will become the clipping mask.
Select the layer bar of the layer to which you want to apply an effect.
Make sure that the layer is visible ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/OpenEyeIcon.gif" alt="Open Eye icon" width="26">) and unlocked ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/images/OpenPadlockIcon.gif" alt="Open Padlock icon" width="26">) so you can edit it.
Select all objects in the layer (you might need to do a marquee select) and then apply the desired effect.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 7 – Transforming Objects</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/Composite.png" alt="Finished practice image file for Tutorial 7" width="500" class="lazy">
You can modify objects in many ways as you create your artwork – including quickly and precisely controlling their size, shape, and orientation.
In this lesson, you’ll explore the various transform tools, commands, and palettes as you create three pieces of artwork.

<h4>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: </h4>
Select, scale, move, rotate, and shear individual objects and objects in a group.
Rotate objects using default rotation centers and centers that you have moved.
Use the <b>Transform</b> palette to modify the shape of an object with precision.
Work with snap guides and snap objects to guide lines.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
In this lesson, you’ll transform parts of a logo to use in three pieces of artwork to create a letterhead design, an envelope, and a business card template.
Start Inkscape.
Download and <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Composite.svg"><b>Composite.svg</b></a>.
This file contains a composite of the three pieces of finished artwork.
The Citrus Bath &amp; Soap logo in the top left corner of the letterhead is the basis for all the modified objects.
The logo has been resized for the letterhead, envelope, and business card.
<b>Note:</b> You can also view the individual pieces of finished artwork by downloading and opening files <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07EndLetterhd.svg"><b>Tutorial07EndLetterhd.svg</b></a>, <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07Envelope.svg"><b>Tutorial07Envelope.svg</b></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07EndBusCard.svg"><b>Tutorial07EndBusCard.svg</b></a>.
If you like, use the Zoom tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In/Out tool" width="26">) to reduce the view of the finished artwork, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen as you work.
(Use the mouse wheel with and without pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key to move the artwork where you want it in the window.) If you don’t want to leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.
To begin working, you’ll open an existing file set up for the letterhead artwork.
Download and <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07StartLetterhd.svg"><b>Tutorial08StartLetterhd.svg</b></a>.
This start file has been saved with the rulers showing in inches, custom swatches added to the Swatches palette, and blue guidelines for scaling the logo and objects on the letterhead.

Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s, name the file <b>Letterhead.svg</b>, store it in a convenient location, and click on the <b>Save</b> button.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Scaling Objects</span></h2>
You scale objects by enlarging or reducing them horizontally (along the x axis) and vertically (along the y axis) relative to a fixed point of origin that you designate.
If you don’t designate an origin, the objects are scaled from their center points.
You’ll use three methods to scale the logo and two objects copied from the logo.
First, you’ll use the Transform palette to scale down the logo by entering new dimensions and designating the point of origin from which the logo will scale.
Make sure that the <b>Scale stroke width</b> icon and <b>Move gradient with object</b> icon are active at the right end of the Commands Bar:

Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) in the toolbox, click the logo to select the group of objects (type, background, lemon, orange slice, lime slice) that make up the logo.
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Transfor<u>m</u> to display the Transform palette.
The Transform palette appears docked on the right side of the screen.
The Transform palette contains options for moving, scaling, rotating, skewing, and distorting an object by manipulating the handles of its bounding box.
You can move an object relative to a point of origin of your choosing or absolute position on the artboard, scale an object keeping or not keeping aspect ratio, and distort an object by editing its matrix or creating a new matrix.

A check mark will appear to the left of the Snap Controls Bar option when you click on the option and the bar will appear.
If the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt="Enable snapping icon" width="26">) isn’t highlighted, click on it to activate it.
Then, click on the <b>Snap guides</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SnapGuidesIcon.gif" alt="Snap Guides icon" width="26">) to activate its functioning.
<b>Note:</b> The <b>Enable snapping</b> feature acts as a master switch that allows activating all other snapping features under it, including the <b>Snap guides</b> function.
If the particular snapping feature you want to use is not highlighted, check to see whether the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon is highlighted.
If it’s off, turn it on, then turn your option on.
Click on the logo with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) and drag the logo to the upper left-hand corner of the artboard where it fits into the small square defined by four guide lines.

Next you’ll copy the background object in the logo and scale the new object by dragging its bounding box to fit the background of the letterhead.
With the logo still selected, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup to ungroup the larger group in the logo.
See how the smaller subgroups remain grouped.
If desired, use the Zoom tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt="Zoom In/Out tool" width="26">) to zoom in on the logo.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), click away from the logo to deselect it, and then click below the word “Bath” to select the light-blue background object in the logo.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the background image.
All the objects in the logo become darkened a little bit because there is now a copy of the background color, which is actually a gradient, on top of all the objects.
Now drag the copy the background to the bottom left corner of the page, aligning it with the snap guides.
You can press the arrow keys to nudge it into place.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/BackgroundMoved.gif" alt="Move the background object." class="lazy">

Click away from the background object to deselect it.
Locking the background object makes it easier to select other objects you’ll add to the artwork without accidentally the background.
You can also lock all artwork above the selected object – for example, if you want to edit an object in the background that has objects on top of it – or all objects on other layers.
In addition, you can use the <b>Layers</b> palette to lock objects.
Once objects are locked, they cannot be selected or edited.
You can quickly lock multiple objects, groups of objects, and sublayers by locking the parent layer.
The lemon in the logo is comprised of two objects grouped together.
Now you’ll copy and move the lemon and place it at the bottom of the letterhead.
Click on the collection of citrus fruits in the lower part of the logo and choose <u>O</u>bject &lt; <u>U</u>ngroup to separate them into three distinct objects.
If the logo text is also included in the selection, Choose <u>O</u>bject &lt; <u>U</u>ngroup again to separate the text from the fruit objects.
If the fruits are grouped, ungroup them.
Now, select the lemon in the logo, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to copy it, and move the new lemon to the bottom right corner of the letterhead guide.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/MovingLemon.gif" alt="Move copy of lemon to lower right corner of page" class="lazy">

You’ll use the Scale tool to resize the new lemon.
Select the copy of the lemon if it isn’t selected already.
Click on the <b>Scale</b> tab in the <b>Transform</b> palette, set the unit of measurement to percent (<b>%</b>), set the width to 300 (300 percent), and click on the <b>Scale proportionally</b> checkbox to maintain the aspect ratio of width to height.
Click the <b><u>A</u>pply</b> button.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Rotating Objects</span></h2>
Objects are rotated by turning them around a designed point of rotation.
You can rotate objects by clicking on them twice, first to display their bounding boxes and handles to allow resizing, and second to display handles to allow rotation and shearing.
When the center of rotation appears after the second click, you can rotate the object about that point.
You can also drag that center of rotation to any other location you want where it will still act as a center about which your object will rotate.
You can rotate objects using the Transform palette to set a point of origin and a rotation angle.
You can also rotate objects using the Rotate palette to set its rotation angle.
In the examples below, the middle figure shows a lemon object rotated about its default center of rotation.
In the third example, the center of rotation has been dragged outside the lemon and a rotation of 30 degrees applied using the <b>Rotate</b> palette in the <b>Transform</b> palette.

Now you’ll create a flower.
You will first create the sepals by distorting the edges of a star.
You will then create the petals by rotating copies of an ellipse, converting them into paths, and then merging them into one object using the <b>Union</b> option for paths.
Select the Star tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/StarTool.gif" alt="Star and polygon tool" width="26">) in the toolbox, type <b>5</b> into the <b>Corners</b> text box to make a five-pointed star, leave the other settings at their default values, and position the pointer in the artwork next to the lemon.
Drag the tool to draw a five-pointed star that’s about the same size as the lemon.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/MakeStar.gif" alt="Make a five-pointed star" class="lazy">

Now you’ll make the flower petals.
You’ll create a white ellipse, move its center of rotation to one end, and use a combination of &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the ellipse and the <b>Rotate</b> palette to create the remaining four petals to create a five-petaled flower.
You’ll then convert the five ellipses into paths and then use the path <b>Union</b> option to merge them into one object.
Make an ellipse and color it white.
With the ellipse still selected, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.
Click on the ellipse again to bring up the rotate and shear handles.
The center of rotation should (of course) appear in the center of ellipse.
Drag the center of rotation to one end of the ellipse.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Shearing Objects</span></h2>
You will now shear the flower.
Shearing an object slants, or skews, the sides of the object along the axis you specify, keeping opposite sides parallel and making the object nonsymmetrical.
Marquee select the whole flower and choose Object &gt; Group to group them into one object.
Click on the <b>Skew</b> tab in the <b>Transform</b> palette.
Enter <b>-10</b> in the <b>Horizontal:</b> text field, leave the <b>Vertical:</b> text field at <b>0</b>, and select <b>°</b> (degrees) in the unit of measurement field.

Bring the letterhead artwork file that you were working on earlier.
You can use the &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; key combination to switch to the other active Inkscape window.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), draw a marquee around the logo so that all the objects in it are selected.
Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>C</u>opy to copy the logo to the Clipboard.
Press &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; again so you can switch back to the envelope Inkscape window.
Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>P</u>aste.
You’ll move the pasted logo to within ¼-inch of the top left corner of the envelope by specifying the x and y coordinates in relation to the ruler origin.
The ruler origin is the point where 0 appears on each ruler.
The ruler origin in this file begins at the lower left corner of the envelope, and the ruler units are in inches.
If the Snapping Toolbar isn’t visible, then choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide &gt; Sn<u>a</u>p Controls Bar.
Click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt="Enable snapping icon" width="26">) and the <b>Snap guides</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SnapGuidesIcon.gif" alt="Snap guides icon" width="26">) to make them active.
Drag the logo artwork to the upper left corner of the envelope where the guide lines intersect.
A tooltip window appears when the upper left corner of the logo image is very close to the guide line intersection, signaling you of the image’s proximity and that snapping to the corner will take place.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Reflecting Objects</span></h2>
You can make mirror reflections of objects by flipping them across an invisible vertical or horizontal mirror.
There are two reflect functions available when the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) is active.
They are located in the Commands Bar.

Now you’ll use the Vertical Reflect tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/VerticalReflectTool.gif" alt="Vertical Reflect tool" width="26">) to make a mirror image of the orange slice in the logo.
Use the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) to select the orange slice in the logo.
Zoom in if necessary.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to make a copy of the orange slice.
You’ll see the image flicker a little bit as the copy is made and placed directly on top of the original orange slice.

Enlarge the Orange Slice.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Changing the Perspective</span></h2>
Now you’ll use the Perspective tool to change the perspective of the orange slice.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;The Perspective Tool</h3>
The Perspective tool distorts a path or paths that have been grouped so that an object’s original bounding box is mapped to the edges of a quadrilateral (square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, etc.) and a perspective operation is applied to the path.
To use this function, create the envelope box (transformation quadrilateral) that will govern how the object will be distorted.
Use the Line tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Line tool icon" width="26">), the Bézier pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Bezier pen tool icon" width="26">), or the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/RectangleTool.gif" alt="Rectangle tool" width="26">).
Make sure that the first corner created is the lower left corner of the quadrilateral.
Then, convert the envelope box and the object or objects to paths.
Use the <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path and <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>S</u>troke to Path functions.
If you used the Rectangle tool and converted it to a path with <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path, you will most likely have to rotate the quadrilateral 90° anticlockwise to position the first corner node from the upper left to the lower left corner.
This is an idiosyncratic feature of the Perspective tool we have to work with.
To check for proper orientation, make the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width="26">) active, select the quadrilateral if it has been deselected, and press the &lt;Tab&gt; key.
The lower left node of the rectangle should become highlighted, indicating that the rectangle is oriented corrected.
If another node is highlighted instead, then rotate the rectangle until the highlighted node is the lower left corner.
The Perspective tool is idiosyncratic in how it works.
Before transforming your object, both it and the transformation quadrilateral must be converted into paths.
Click on your object and choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.
Do the same with the quadrilateral.
If your object is a group of objects, convert the individual objects into individual paths by: ungrouping them by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup or by clicking the <b>Ungroup selected groups</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/UngroupIcon.gif" alt="Ungroup selected groups icon" width="26">) in the Commands Bar.
Then, with the separate objects still group-selected, convert them into separate paths by choosing <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.
Now regroup these paths with <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup or by clicking on the <b>Group selected groups</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/GroupIcon.gif" alt="Group selected objects icon" width="26">) in the Commands Bar.
Select the grouped paths to be transformed (as a single object now), then select the transformation quadrilateral, in this order (<u>important!</u>), by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">).
Now and finally, choose <u>E</u>xtensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Perspective.
If you forget to convert the distortion envelope into a path or any of the objects, the Perspective tool will stop and give you a warning message that one or both objects weren’t converted.
One way to check whether an object was or wasn’t converted is to choose the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width="26">).
All path nodes show up when this tool is selected.
You can determine whether any object hasn’t been converted by the shape and color of its path nodes.
Sometimes, the Perspective tool doesn’t perform the way you want it to.
To troubleshoot, experiment with different techniques, such as grouping all the path objects you want to transform, and then using the Perspective tool.
If items are already grouped and you still receive a warning message, ungroup them and then regroup them again – this technique works in various cases.
Outline view (choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>D</u>isplay mode &gt; <u>O</u>utline) can be used to identify ghost outlines from objects with fills and strokes set to <i>None</i>.
Delete them.
They can produce unexpected results that show up in the transformed object.
<b>Remember:</b> the Perspective tool works <u>only</u> with paths.
<b>Important:</b> Start drawing the trapezoid from the lower left corner.
Then continue to make edges in a clockwise direction.
You are creating an ordered sequence of corner points that the Inkscape Perspective function understands and can work with.
Draw the distortion box.
To check if the lower left corner is the first made corner, click on the trapezoid with the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width="26">).
Then, press &lt;Tab&gt;.
If the first corner is highlighted, then the envelope box is correctly oriented.

Make a copy of the lime slice.
Position the new lime slice below and slightly to the right of the logo.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/CitrusLogo7.gif" alt="Move the copy of the lime slice." class="lazy">
Move the copy of the lime slice down and to the right.
Now you’ll use the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys in combination with the Select tool to scale the new lime slice.
Note that using the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys together with the Select tool allows you to resize an object from the center of its bounding box and maintain its aspect.
With the lime slice still selected, hold down both the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys and drag the bottom right corner handle down to scale the object from its center and make the lime slice bigger.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/CitrusLogo8.gif" alt="Rescale the lime slice so it is larger." class="lazy">
Resize the lime slice.
You will now distort the lime slice using the Perspective tool.
You need to prepare the lime slice object for the Perspective function before you apply it.
You will ungroup the component parts of the image, eliminate the color gradient (the Perspective tool does not work with gradients at this point in time, only solid colors), convert the individual objects into paths, and then distort.
With the lime slice image still selected (reselect it if it is deselected), use the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-G hot-key combination to ungroup the component parts that make up the slice.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/UngroupLimeSlice.gif" alt="Ungroup the lime slice." class="lazy">
Ungroup the lime slice.
Select one of the lime sections in the image.
Bring up the Color palette, click on the <b>Fill</b> tab if it isn’t active already, and click on the <b>Flat color</b> icon.
The gradient is now a solid color.
The Perspective function can work with the image more effectively now.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/EliminateGradient.gif" alt="Eliminate the gradient." class="lazy">
Eliminate the gradient.
You will now make a shape consisting of the rib "spokes" and the white inner circle.
Start by selecting only the individual ribs using the &lt;Shift&gt;-Select tool and color them red by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the Red swatch.
You &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the Red swatch on the Color palette in this case because the spokes are lines having a significant thickness, not two-dimensional objects that can have a color fill, such as long rectangles.
So, instead of clicking on the Red swatch (nothing will happen), &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the Red swatch.
Red is a good color to work with here because the spokes can get lost against any white background.
Red prevents that from happening.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectRibsColorRed.gif" alt="Select the ribs and color them red." class="lazy">
&lt;Shift&gt;-select the ribs and color them red.
Draw a red circle that completely covers the inner white circle and ribs.

Turn the circle into a red wheel rim.
&lt;Shift&gt;-select the red circumference and the red ribs.
You will now convert them into paths.

Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path and then choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>S</u>troke to Path.
You can see individual nodes when the Node tool is active.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/Convert2Paths.gif" alt="Convert objects and strokes to paths." class="lazy">
Convert objects and strokes to paths.
You will now convert the individual rib and circumference paths into one path using the <b>Union</b> function.
With the paths still selected, choose Path &gt; Union.
The individual paths combine into one path, something that the Perspective function can work with more effectively.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/PathsUnionized.gif" alt="Path union." class="lazy">
Apply the path union function.
The outer lime-colored circle has a lime-colored stroke and a white fill.
Change the white fill to lime so the background circle has just one color.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/TotalLimeGreen.gif" alt="Background lime-green circle." class="lazy">
Change the white circle fill to lime green.

Change the red ribs and circumference to white.
Because the image originally had a gradient in its make-up, there might be a remnant figure left behind when you replaced the gradient with a solid color.
An artefact like this can produce unexpected and undesired side-effects in the distortion process.
To find out, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>D</u>isplay mode &gt; <u>O</u>utline.
If you see a figure like the one below, select the inner spurious circle while you’re still in Outline mode and press the &lt;Delete&gt; button on the keyboard.

Draw a bounding box around the lime slice object and choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path convert the box into a path.
Here, the bounding box is colored lime green, which was the last color used from the Color palette.
Group the converted box (now a path) and the lime slice object using the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G hot key combination.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/FigureAndBoundingBoxGrouped.gif" alt="Group the lime image and the bounding box." class="lazy">
Group the lime image and the bounding box.
If you haven’t done so already, draw a distortion bounding box starting from the lower left corner of the box shape.
You can use the Line tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Line tool icon" width="26">) or the Bézier Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Bezier pen tool icon" width="26">).
If you use the the Rectangle tool, you’ll need to rotate the rectangle or square anticlockwise by 90° so the initial corner (consider it as Corner #1) is the bottom left corner.
Test to see if this is the case by choosing the <b>Node</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Edit paths by nodes tool" width="26">) while the box is still highlighted and pressing the &lt;Tab&gt; key.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
How do you resize an object? What transformations can you make using the <b>Transform</b> palette? How do you copy an object from one Inkscape file to another? How can you change perspective or distort an object? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
There are two ways you can resize an object: You can select an object with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) and drag a directional handle.
To rescale an object proportionately as you change its size, hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key as you drag the directional handle.
You can resize an object using the <b>Scale</b> option in the <b>Transform</b> palette.
You can enter its exact height, width, unit of measurement (inch, percent, millimeter, centimeter, pixel, pica), and resize individual objects separately.
The object is resized relative to the center of its bounding box.
The <b>Transform</b> palette allows you to make the following transformations: <b>Move:</b> by moving or strategically placing objects in your artwork (by specifying the x and y coordinates and the point of origin).
<b>Scale:</b> by specifying the width and height of selected objects, and whether proportionally or not.
<b>Matrix:</b> by editing the entries in a transformation matrix that controls the amount of translation, scaling, rotation, and skewing, all in one operation.
You can copy an Inkscape object by: selecting it in the source file with the Select tool  
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), and then choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>C</u>opy or pressing the hot key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C (<b>C</b> for <b>C</b>opy) to make a duplicate, making the destination file active by bring up its Inkscape window, and choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>P</u>aste or pressing the hot key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V to paste the object into its new home.
You can change the perspective of or distort an object by: Converting all objects into paths using the <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path function and converting all strokes to paths using the <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>S</u>troke to Path function.
Drawing a 4-sided distortion envelope (a quadrilateral) using the Line tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/LineTool.gif" alt="Line tool icon" width="26">), the Bézier pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/PenTool.gif" alt="Bezier pen tool icon" width="26">), or the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/images/RectangleTool.gif" alt="Rectangle tool" width="26">).

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/RadioWave.gif" alt="Finished practice image file for Tutorial 8" class="lazy">
Inkscape’s Transparency feature gives you the opportunity of adding a new dimension to your artwork that can exceed your expectations and expand your imagination.
You can create special effects using the transparency and color blending features, such as combining different blending modes and transparencies with clipping and masking tools.

<h4>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: </h4>
Use the Transparency feature.
Change the opacity of objects.
Use color blending modes.
Use group options for transparency.
Use color and opacity masking.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
In this lesson, you’ll add transparency to artwork in several ways.
You can vary the degree of transparency of an object’s fill or stroke (or both), a group of objects, or a layer from 100% opacity (completely solid) to 0% opacity (completely transparent).
When you decrease an object’s opacity, the underlying artwork becomes visible through that object as if you were working with stained glass.
Using transparency features, you can also create special effects, such as knocking out underlying colors or creating graduated transparencies or blends.
Transparency can be applied to multiple objects, groups, and even to entire layers.
In this lesson you will focus on the transparency and color blending features and their capabilities.
Learn how to apply transparency to layers in Lesson 7, "Working with Layers." Start Inkscape.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Basic color blending and blending modes</span></h2>
Color blending works with layers to produce its visual effects.
When an object needs to have its own special see-through effect, it is best to have that object in its own layer.
Several objects that use the same blending mode can be in the same layer for the sake of efficiency.
You will create a layer and move the leftmost wave to that layer to see how blending modes work.
<b>Note:</b> If you did not practice Tutorial 6, Working with Layers, I strongly recommend that you take time to become acquainted with layer techniques now.
The material is this tutorial will be easier to work with.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Exploring color blend modes</h3>

<h4>Multiply</h4>
Select the left wave if it isn’t already selected.
The <b>Left wave</b> layer bar Layers panel should be highlighted.
Click on the arrow at the right end of the <b>Blend mode</b> options bar and select <b>Multiply</b> from the dropdown option list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/MultiplySelected.gif" alt="Select the Multiply blend mode from the Blend Mode dropdown list." class="lazy">
Select <b>Multiply</b> from the Blend Mode dropdown list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/FirstWaveMultiplied.gif" alt="Multiply color blending applied to leftmost wave" width="600" class="lazy">
Result of applying the <b>Multiply</b> color blend mode to the leftmost wave.
<b>Multiply</b> multiplies the underlying color with the overlapping object’s color.
The result is always a darker color.
Multiplying any color with black produces black.
Multiplying any color with white leaves the color unchanged.
The effect is similar to drawing with multiple magic markers.
This blending mode is used often for drop shadows.

<h4>Difference</h4>
Select the middle (the <b>Middle wave</b> layer bar highlights), select <b>Difference</b> from the dropdown option list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/DifferenceSelected.gif" alt="Select the Difference blending mode" class="lazy">
Select the <b>Difference</b> blending mode.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/MiddleWaveDifference.gif" alt="Difference color blending applied to middle wave" width="600" class="lazy">
Result of applying the <b>Difference</b> color blend mode to the middle wave.
<b>Difference</b> creates the effect of seeing underlying objects as a color film negative.
Using it subtracts either the overlaying color from the underlying color or the underlying color from the overlaying color, depending on which one has the greater brightness value.
Blending with white inverts the underlying color values; blending with black produces no change.

<h4>Screen</h4>
Select the left wave, then select <b>Screen</b> from the <b>Blend mode</b> dropdown option list.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/ScreenSelected.gif" alt="Select the Screen blending mode" class="lazy">
Select the <b>Screen</b> blending mode.

Result of applying the <b>Screen</b> color blend mode to the right wave.
<b>Screen</b> multiplies the inverse of the overlying and underlying colors.
The resulting color is always a lighter color.
Screening with black leaves the color unchanged, and screening with white produces white.
The effect is similar to projecting multiple slide images on top of each other.
As you can see, the portion of the right wave that overlies the white background is invisible.
Only the top portion that overlies the background text shows.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Making an Opacity Mask</span></h2>
In this section, you will make a copy of the logo at the beginning of this tutorial.
When you look at the logo closely, you will see that it is composed of four layers: one containing small type, one containing the wave shapes, one containing stripes, and one containing large type.

Before the large logo text is put into place, you’ll create and add a decorative stripe pattern.
First, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; Page <u>G</u>rid.
The grid will help you measure out the design.
Then, increase the magnification of the area to the upper left of the left wave.
If the Snap Controls Bar isn’t active, choose <u>V</u>iew &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide &gt; Sn<u>a</u>p Controls Bar.
Select the <b>Enable Snapping (%)</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt=" Enable Snapping icon" width="26">), the <b>Snap nodes, paths, and handles</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/SnapNodesIcon.gif" alt="Snap node, paths, and handles icon" width="26">), and the <b>Snap to grids</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial08/images/Snap2GridsIcon.gif" alt="Snap to Grids icon" width="26">).

Set the <b>Opacity</b> to <b>50</b> percent and <b>Blend mode</b> to <b>Color Burn</b>.
<b>Color Burn</b> is a blending mode that gives you a darker result than the <b>Multiply</b> mode.
It increases contrast by darkening the original colors of the image.
This effect increases contrast with the blend colors.
The result is brighter, more highly saturated colors while reducing highlights.
Color Burn blending with white produces no change.
Practical uses in <b>Color Burn</b> blending include heightening brilliant colors of photogenic food dishes on a dark cloth or table background, sunset colors that contrast against a darkening landscape, or for putting greater focus on flowers in a display or on a bush or tree.

Finished artwork.
You have just concluded a tutorial where you became more closely acquainted with transparency and color blending tools, and with their use in combination.
You also learned that the clipping tool “cookie-cuts” through multiple layers to modify the borders of your artwork.
Try out different fonts for the logo text and different blending modes.
Rearrange the layers to get different results.
A layer is the computer graphic equivalent of tracing paper.
Just as you can change the order in which you can stack tracing paper as you create a piece of artwork, so can you change the stacking order of layers as you try out different ideas.
They exist to help you develop and fine-hone your skills.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
What is the difference between transparency and opacity? What is a blending mode and how is it applied? Can transparency and color blending be combined? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
Transparency and opacity are opposites of each other.
Transparency has to do with how much you can see through an object (how transparent it is); opacity has to do with how much you can’t see through an object, or how opaque it is.
Blending modes allow you to vary the way that colors in objects interact or blend with the underlying objects.
Modes can be selected from the Blend mode dropdown menu in the Layers palette.
Yes, transparency and color blending can be combined to produce a broad range of design effects, such as images produced with stained glass, tracing paper, lighting effects, and more.

One of the most powerful features of Inkscape is the ability to use type as a graphic element.
Like other objects, type can be painted, scaled, rotated, and so on.
You can also wrap type around objects, make it follow along the shape of a path, create type masks, import text files into containers, and modify the shapes of individual letters in a block of type.

<h4>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: </h4>
Create type in containers and along paths.
Import text files into type containers.
Apply an envelope effect to type, and edit the envelope contents.
Adjust type attributes and formatting, including the font, leading, and paragraph alignment.
Format text and adjust the text flow.
Use Open Type.
Wrap type around a graphic.
Create stylized letterforms with outlined type.
Create type masks.
Place text on a path.
Save a file in PDF format for online distribution and viewing.

You will need to have the Chaparral Pro font installed in your system.
Chaparral Pro is an OpenType® font that can be used on both Windows and Macintosh operating systems.
You can download it from here as a zipped package of Chaparral Pro font faces <a href="chaparral-pro.zip">Chaparral Pro font</a>, or from a font site on the Web, such as <a href="https://www.wfonts.com/font/chaparral-pro">Wfonts</a> or <a href="https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/chaparral-pro">Cufon Fonts</a>.

Once Inkscape has opened the starting file, choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s…, and save it as <b>TaiChi.svg</b> in a convenient storage location.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Adding Type to a Document</span></h2>
You can add type into an Inkscape document in different ways.
You can type directly into the artwork, copy and paste type from other documents, and import entire text files.
To begin adding type to your artwork, you’ll type the Tai Chi title on the poster.
Select the Text tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextTool.gif" alt="Text tool" width="26">) in the toolbox.
The Select tool cursor changes to the Text tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextToolCursor.gif" alt="Text tool cursor" width="26">).
Position the Text tool cursor so that the center of the cross hair is in the top left corner of the artwork.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextToolCursorPositioned.gif" alt="Text tool positioned" class="lazy">

Gray color copied to title text.
The <b>RGBA</b> label to the color code bar stands for <b>R</b>ed, <b>G</b>reen, <b>B</b>lue, and <b>A</b>lpha Channel.
An <b>Alpha Channel</b> value determines how transparent (or conversely, how opaque) an object is.
A value of <b>00</b> means that an object is fully transparent, while a value of <b>ff</b> means fully opaque.
Click on the <b>Text and Font</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextAndFontIcon.gif" alt="Text and Font Icon" width="26">) in the Commands Bar.

By default, the <b>Text and Font Command Bar</b> displays the selected font and its style, size, kerning, leading, and tracking values.
If the type selection contains two or more attributes, the corresponding text boxes are blank.
(<b>Leading</b> is the amount of space between lines or paragraphs.
<b>Kerning</b> is the space between two characters.
<b>Tracking</b> is the spacing between a string of characters.) Type <b>120</b> in the Font Size text box and press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; to increase the font size to 120 points.
The text box you drew earlier appears and a blinking angled line segment also appears.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TitleTextSize120_1.gif" alt="Change title text size to 120 points.
The text box and a blinking angled line segment appear." class="lazy">
Title text now at 120 points but doesn’t fit into the text box.
The title text has been magnified so much that it no longer fits into the text box.
To remedy this situation, click on the diamond on the lower right corner of the text box and drag it down and to the right until the title text appears in its entirety.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/ExpandTextBox.gif" alt="Expand the text box" class="lazy">
Expand the text box until the title text appears.
You can also select a font and font size using the <b>Text and Font</b> palette dropdown listings.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Reshaping Text with a Deformation Lattice</span></h2>
A <b>deformation lattice</b> is just a grid that allows you to manipulate a shape inside it.
The grid you’ll be using has points where grid lines intersect that you can move to reshape your object.
You will distort the text to make it follow the shape of the image of the person.
Select the title text and press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to make a copy of it.
&lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag the copy of the text off to the side of the artboard and leave the original text in place.
The copy of the text object serves as a backup copy.

You can add more than one path effect to your shape object.
When you want to use one particular effect, click on it to select it, it will highlight to show you that it is the currently active effect and immediately available for use.
Click on the Bend path node tool option.
The title text is immediately surrounded by a deformation bounding box with a bend tool line running through its length.

<b>Node Tool</b> is selected and deformation bounding box appears.
With the Node Tool cursor, click on the Bend tool line and drag it down to create a curve in the title text that mimics the curvature of the person’s upper body (the result does not have to be exact).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/BendToolCurved.gif" alt="The Bend tool line is curved." class="img-width">
Pull down on the <b>Bend Tool</b> line with the <b>Node tool</b> cursor to curve it.
You will now fine tune the placement and curvature of the poster title text.
Alternate between using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) to move, rotate, and resize the entire text object and using the Edit On-canvas tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/EditOnCanvasIcon.gif" alt="Edit On-canvas icon" width="26">) to fine-adjust the downward bend in the curvature.
When the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">) is active and you need to use the Bend tool, click on the Edit On-canvas tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/EditOnCanvasIcon.gif" alt="Edit On-canvas icon" width="26">) in the <b>Path Effects</b> palette so the Bend Tool line will reappear as the active tool.
If the Bend tool disappears for no reason, just click on the Edit On-canvas tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/EditOnCanvasIcon.gif" alt="Edit On-canvas icon" width="26">) to reactivate it.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating Type Paths</span></h2>
You can modify the shapes of individual letters in a block of type by converting the block to type paths or letterforms.
When you create type paths, each character becomes a separate object with compound paths outlining the character.
This is helpful when creating logos or other artwork that is distributed to many people and might not have the same fonts that you used.
Now you will create the number 300 and convert it into paths.
Click on the Text tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextTool.gif" alt="Text tool" width="26">) in the toolbox.
Position the cursor and click on a spot to the right of the filled rectangle in the upper right section of the page.
You will start typing here.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/StartTypingHere.gif" alt="Start typing here." class="lazy">
Start typing here.
Type <b>6</b> &lt;Enter&gt; <b>0</b> &lt;Enter&gt;<b>0</b> &lt;Enter&gt;.
The text looks like it flows down from the top.
We used Chaparral Pro, bold, 45 points for the font.
We also changed the Spacing between baselines ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/LineSpacing.9Percent.gif" alt="Spacing between baselines icon">) from <b>1.25 %</b> to <b>0.90 %</b>.

Typing in the number text object.
Group select the three numbers (click on one number or marquee select).
The three numbers are currently one group of text, so clicking on one number selects the entire group.

Select the number text object.
Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to path.
Inkscape now no longer considers these numbers as a single text object but as a group of individual paths whose shapes can be modified in many different ways.
Note that <thead> baseline marker square at the bottom left of the character <b>6</b> has disappeared.
We will create our own custom stylization.
Deselect the character <b>6</b>.
Choose the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/NodeTool.gif" alt="Node tool" width="26">) and click on the character <b>6</b>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating Type Masks</span></h2>
Masks crop part of an image so that only a portion of it is revealed through the shape or shapes that you create.
You can use type as a mask without having to convert the type to outlines first.
In this tutorial, you’ll create a mask using type and an embedded bitmap image.
An image of a cloudy sky was pasted into the document to use as the background of the mask.
You will add the heading "ASIAN STUDIES PROGRAM" in the top right corner of the poster and convert it to a type mask over the cloudy sky image.
Click on the Text tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextTool.gif" alt="Text tool" width="26">) in the toolbox, and then click in a clear area underneath the sky image where you will type the course title.
Type, in capital letters, ASIAN STUDIES PROGRAM.
Use Chaparral Pro, bold, 28 pt.
Press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; after each word to left justify-them.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/AsianStudiesProgramLeftJustified.gif" alt="Asian Studies Program left justified" class="lazy">

If it covers the text, then click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/Lower1StepIcon.gif" alt="Lower One Step icon" width="26">) in the Tool Controls Bar to place the image behind the text.
We placed the image so the lettering is superimposed over the upper left corner where there is relatively strong contrast in colors.
<b>Note:</b> the image that is to be used as a mask is like a cookie cutter that cuts out the cookies from the image underneath.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Typing Along a Path</span></h2>
You can enter type along a path in Inkscape.
In this exercise, you’ll add a freeform line of text to the poster.
We will use the Adobe Garamond Pro Regular font in this section.
If this font is not on your computer, you can download it from here, <a href="Adobe%20Garamond%20Pro%20Regular.zip">Adobe Garamond Pro Regular</a>, or from the Internet at <a href="https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Adobe-Garamond-Pro-Regular">Fonts geek</a> or <a href="https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/adobe-garamond-pro-2">Cufon Fonts</a>.
Unzip the files and install them.
If Inkscape is currently running, exit and restart it so it will “see” the newly installed font(s).
Select the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">).
Magnify the left arm of the figure so it’ll be easier to draw the type path underneath it.
Start the type path by clicking with the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">) under the drop shadow where the arm joins the body.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Having Text Flow into an Arbitrary Shape</span></h2>
With Inkscape, you can fit text into a shape envelope you create.
You can edit the text as you would regular text: changing font family, font size, color, and more.
In this exercise, you will create a custom text box that will contain type that conforms to the envelope’s shape.
Marquee-select all the contents of the artboard and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag the lower right corner sizing handle until it meets the right-hand guideline.
The width of the poster image should now fill all the width between the left-hand and right-hand guidelines.

With the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">), draw a containment box that follows the person’s shape on the right, preferably avoiding the drop shadow, goes straight to the right from the figure to the right guideline, then going straight down to the bottom guideline, over to the left on the bottom guide line, and then up, avoiding the drop shadow and reconnecting with the starting point.
Use the figure below as a template.
<b>Note:</b> You can draw the containment box any way you wish.
The direction in this exercise is completely arbitrary.
The Snap to grids function is meant to help you draw straight horizontal and vertical lines with minimal fuss.

<b>Note:</b> Inkscape occasionally doesn’t give you the exact number of points, but gives you a closest approximation, as you can see in the figure below, of 13.99 pt, instead of 14 pt.
Don’t be concerned about it — it’s a mathematical artifact of the resizing process inside Inkscape’s program machinery.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Saving Your File for Electronic Distribution</span></h2>
Now you’ll save a copy of the poster in Portable Document Format (PDF) so you can distribute it electronically, or link it to your Web site.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/ConfigurePDFSpecifications.gif" alt="Adjusting parameters for the PDF file">
Adjusting parameters for the PDF file.
<b>Note:</b> Inkscape’s default value for Text output is <b>Embed fonts</b>.
This value means that any PDF viewer will have to have all the fonts that the artwork uses available to view the file correctly.
If the fonts do not exist for that viewer, they will appear as a default font that might not reflect the artwork accurately.
It is wise to choose the <b>Convert text to paths</b> options so the text is font-independent and will render correctly every time.
Computers and Web browser technology has advanced over the years to where high resolution imagery is the standard.
Inkscape’s default raster resolution is 96 dots per inch.
Doubling that value significantly reduces the graininess seen in low-resolution images and improves their appearance.
High-quality printing might require even higher values, depending upon the technology used.
You have the option of increasing resolution to any custom value just by changing the value of the raster resolution.
The value is automatically saved in the file.

You have now finished this tutorial on typography.
We have only touched the surface of what you can do with text in graphic design — it is such a broad topic.
Explore whatever ideas arise, and play with the features Inkscape offers you in putting those ideas on-screen.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
Describe three ways to enter text into the artwork.
Describe two ways to change the font and size of type.
How do you create type that follows the shape of a path or an object? What is a reason for converting type to paths? How do you create a type mask? How do you create a PDF version of an Inkscape document? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
To enter text in the artwork, do any of the following: Select the Type tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextTool.gif" alt="Text tool" width="26">) and start typing.
Copy text from an external file to the Clipboard, and then paste into the artwork using <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>P</u>aste or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V (hot key combination for pasting).
Click inside a shape that has text already placed inside through the text flow feature with the Type tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/TextTool.gif" alt="Text tool" width="26">) and start typing.
To change the font and size of type, you can use the controls in the Text and Font palette, or choose commands from the Font and Size submenus in the Type Tool Commands Bar.
Convert type to paths when you want to transform (scale, reshape, and so on) letters individually in the word or block of type.
Paths are also useful for filling type with a gradient fill.
Paths also eliminate the need to send the font along with the file when sharing with others.
Create the path you want the text to follow using a shape, or by using the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">) or Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial09/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">).
Have the text available (already typed or pasted in).
Select both the text and the path, and choose <u>T</u>ext &gt; <u>P</u>ut on Path.
One way to create a type mask is to select the type that you want to be the mask, and select the object, bitmap image, or type that you want to show through the mask.
(The masking type must be in front of any other objects.) Then choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Clip &gt; <u>S</u>et to create the type mask.
To create a PDF version of an Inkscape file, you choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; Save <u>A</u>s…; then for type, you select Portable Document Format.

Using custom and ruler guides can help you produce quality artwork, such as logos, from scanned art.
Combine object arrangement or painting order with transparency and masking options to create dramatic results that vary based on which shapes are in front or behind.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: Turn scanned artwork into a template.
Use and create guides.
Re-create a scanned logo and convert it into vector art.
Constrain objects.
Clone objects.
Rearrange object order.
Integrate transparency with placement of objects.
Create a clipping mask.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
In this lesson, you’ll digitally re-create a logo that is supplied to you as a low-resolution scan.
This is a simple technique that can be applied to a multitude of projects including creating artwork from photographs, or update your company’s logo into a scalable vector form that can be used over and over again without degradation.
Before you begin, download and install the font <a href="wicked-mouse.zip">Wicked Mouse</a>.
You can also find the Wicked Mouse font on the Internet at <a href="https://www.dafontfree.io/wicked-mouse-font/">https://www.dafontfree.io/wicked-mouse-font/</a>.

Many times a client provides the only working logo that he or she has, and it’s already printed — perhaps even on a napkin! With no digital information, you can still recreate the client’s logo with the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">).

The logo and text objects are not aligned.
That is how they were scanned in.
You will make a template out of this imported image and draw new workable images on top of it.
First, you will make the black images partially transparent so you can easily distinguish between them and your drawings.
With the imagery still selected, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>F</u>ill and Stroke, and adjust the transparency (with the <b>Opacity (%)</b> bar) to <b>50</b>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating Custom Guides</span></h2>
You should be getting an idea of the direction that you are headed.
Using template layers is very much like the workflow you would use with artwork placed underneath a piece of tracing paper.
Before you start any project that requires some level of accuracy, you should set up guides.
In this tutorial, you will use standard ruler guides, as well as custom guides that you create yourself from pen paths.
<i>
<h4>Creating and Using Guidelines</h4>
</i>Inkscape has two kinds of guides that you can use: Standard ruler guides are non-printing straight lines that run vertically or horizontally on the page.
Guide objects are created by converting an object into a guide.
This can be helpful when aligning objects on a diagonal line, or if you need a shape to be guide.
Click and hold on the horizontal ruler.
Drag a ruler guide from the ruler to the bottom (or baseline) of the placed artwork.
Drag another guideline to the top of the artwork.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/DragGuideline2Baseline.png" alt="Drag horizontal guideline to baseline of logo figure" width="500" class="lazy">
Drag a horizontal guideline to the baseline of the logo figure.

Drag a horizontal guideline to the top line of the logo figure.
Click on the vertical ruler and drag out, creating ruler guides to surround both sides of the logo.

Drag a vertical guideline from the left.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/DragGuideline2FarRight.png" alt="Drag another vertical guideline from the left" width="485" class="lazy">
Drag another vertical guideline from the left.
You’ll now create pen paths that will be converted into custom guides.
This makes it easier to keep angles consistent throughout the artwork.
The paths that you are creating should overshoot the top and bottom so that you can make adjustments to them with less difficulty.
Select the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool" width="26">) and click below the baseline of the first "V." Then click over the top of the "v" following the angle.
If you did not get it exactly along the angle, switch to the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool" width="26">) and activate the end points individually to adjust them.

Follow the angle of the inside of the left side of the first V.
Choose the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), click on the first path created.
&lt;Shift&gt;-click on the second path that you created to add it to the selection.
Instead of creating the other side of the “V” with the Pen tool and to avoid risking inaccuracies, you will use the <b>Flip selected objects horizontally</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/FlipHorizontally.gif" alt="Flip objects horizontally icon" width="26">) in the Tool Controls Bar.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the grouped line segments, then click on the <b>Flip selected objects horizontally</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/FlipHorizontally.gif" alt="Flip objects horizontally icon" width="26">) to create a mirror-image of the original two line segments.

Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), begin moving the reflected paths into position over to the other side of the first "V." Hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key to constrain the paths to a horizontal movement as you drag them.

Instead of recreating paths for each “V” shape, you will clone them two times.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool" width="26">), select all four paths, and choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; Clo<u>n</u>e &gt; Create Clo<u>n</u>e.
Hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; and drag the cloned copy over to position it ontop of the next “V” shape in the artwork.
If you hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key after you start dragging, the paths will be constrained to moving in a straight horizontal or vertical path.
You must release the mouse before releasing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key to have the cloning to occur.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/MoveClone.gif" alt="Move the clone to the right." class="lazy">

If necessary, fine-tune any paths with the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool" width="26">).
Then choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; Select Al<u>l</u> or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-A to select all the paths.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Arrangement and Stacking Order</span></h2>
Inkscape stacks sucessively drawn objects, with the first object drawn on the bottom, much like a stack of papers on your desk.
As you add items to the stack, they will cover the previously created objects underneath.
This arrangement, or stacking order is important not only because it affects the way items look when they overlap, but also because the stacking order plays a large part in the creation of masks and the way objects appea when transparency is applied.
In this part of the tutorial, you will change object order to create an illustration for a fish store.

What makes a custom guide different from a ruler guide? What steps do you take to make a scan into a template? What is the difference between <b>Raise the current layer</b> and <b>Raise the current layer to the top</b>? Where must an object be in the painting in order to be used as a clipping mask? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
A custom guide is different from a ruler guide in that it can be created from any path or shape.
A ruler guide is only horizontal or vertical and is created by dragging the guide from the rulers.
To make a scan into a template, it is best to scan it and save the image as a bitmap image file.
Then choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>I</u>mport…, place it on the artboard or where you want to position it.
Select the image, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties…, check the <b>L<u>o</u>ck</b> checkbox to prevent it from being modified accidentally.
Using guides and the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial10/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool" width="26">), re-create the placed scan.
When you have finished redrawing the image, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unlock All.
Delete the original scan image.
<b>Raise the current layer</b> will only bring the selected layer ahead of the layer created right beneath it in the layer stacking order.
This is not the same as <b>Raise the current layer to the top</b>, which will immediately place the selected layer at the very top of the stacking order.
When you are creating a clipping mask, the object acting as the mask must be at the top of the object or layer stacking order.
Always make sure by selecting the object and choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; Raise to <u>T</u>op, or by clicking on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon in the Tool Controls Bar, or by having the clipping mask object in its own layer and having that layer be topmost in the layer stack.

The Interpolate tool blends the shapes and colors of objects together into a new blended object or series of intermediate shapes.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: Create and save gradients.
Add colors to a gradient.
Adjust the direction of a gradient blend.
Create smooth-color blends between objects.
Blend the shapes of objects in intermediate steps.
Modify a blend, including adjusting its path and changing the shape or color of the original objects.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating a Gradient Fill</span></h2>
Gradients can be used very much like colors to fill objects that you create.
A gradient fill is a graduated blend between two or more colors.
You can easily create your own gradients, or you can use the gradients provided with Inkscape and edit them for the desired effect.
To begin the tutorial, you’ll create a gradient fill for one of the chili peppers.
Using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), click to select the chili pepper in the back.
The pepper is painted with a solid color fill and no stroke, as indicated in the Fill and Stroke boxes at the bottom of the toolbox.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/BackChiliSelected.gif" alt="Back chili is selected." class="lazy">
The back chili is selected.

The Fill and Stroke boxes show that
the back chili has a solid fill and no stroke.
Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>F</u>ill and Stroke…, and click on the <b>Linear gradient</b> tab in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel that appears.
Your example might show a gradient background of black grading into transparency or another combination of colors if you have already been working with gradients.
The example here shows the original of the chili grading into transparency as an artifact of previous experiments.
Note that the Fill and Stroke boxes now show that a gradient has been applied and no stroke.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/BackChiliGradientApplied.gif" alt="Back chili has a gradient now and no stroke." width="700" class="lazy">
The back chili now has a linear gradient applied (no stroke).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/GradientAppliedNoStroke.png" alt="Back chili has a gradient now and no stroke." width="250" class="lazy">
The Fill and Stroke boxes show a gradient fill
(no stroke).
In the Fill and Stroke panel, click on the <b>Edit Gradient</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientIcon.gif" alt="Edit gradient icon" width="26">) just below the Gradient library listing.
An <b>Edit Gradient</b> tool appears as a rectangle enclosing the chili with a gradient adjustment tool (line segment with end handles) inside.
The square and circle that end the line segment represent what are called <b>gradient stops</b>, or just <b>stops</b>, where one color starts (the square handle) and the other ends (at the circular handle).
The Select tool cursor changes into the <b>Edit Gradient</b> cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt="Edit gradient cursor" width="26">).

<h4>Important! How the Gradient Tool works.</h4>
Note that the Linear Gradient tool uses the fill color you last used.
Otherwise, the color defaults to black.
The fill color starts out at <u>full opacity under the square stop</u>, and then grades to <u>full transparency under the circular stop</u>.
You need to remember this behavior of the Gradient tool.
To end the gradient in a different color, make a duplicate of the object you want to attach a gradient to and give it a solid fill color that is the color at the end stop.
Using the <b>Lower selection one step</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step tool" width="26">) in the Tool Controls Bar or pressing the &lt;PgDn&gt; key, lower the solid fill color copy of the object to underneath the original object with the gradient.
The result is an object filled with a color-to-color gradient.
Select the square stop with the <b>Edit Gradient cursor</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt="Edit gradient cursor" width="26">).
The square stop turns blue to show that it is active.
In the <b>Fill</b> palette in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel, click on the <b>RGB</b> tab (<u>R</u>ed <u>G</u>reen <u>B</u>lue) if that palette isn’t selected already.
Enter these RGB values in the Color palette: <b>R = 204</b>, <b>G = 0</b>, <b>B = 51</b>, and <b>A = 255</b>.
(Press &lt;Tab&gt; to select each text box.) Press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; to apply the last value typed.
You will now make a duplicate of the chili.
This copy will contain the fill color that represents the end of the gradient.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) active, select the chili and make a duplicate of it with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D or by choosing <u>E</u>dit &gt; Duplic<u>a</u>te.
Note that the duplicated chili adds to the overall darkness of the gradient because there are two gradient chilis, one ontop of the other.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Adjusting the Direction of the Gradient Blend</span></h2>
Once you have painted an object with a gradient fill, you can adjust the direction that the gradient colors blend in the object.
Now you’ll adjust the gradient fill in the other chili pepper.
Use the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) to select the chili pepper in front.
Notice that it’s painted with a radial-type gradient (as indicated in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/FrontChiliSelected.gif" alt="Front chili selected" class="img-width">
Front chili selected.
You can create linear or radial gradients.
Both types of gradient have a starting and an ending color of the fill.
With a radial gradient, the starting color of the gradient defines the center point of the fill, which radiates outward to the ending color.
Select the <b>Gradient</b> tool, which is one of the hidden tools at the bottom of the toolbox.
The <b>Radial gradient</b> tool automatically appears over the selected chili.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Adding Colors to a Gradient</span></h2>
Every gradient in Inkscape has at least two gradient stops.
By editing the color mix of each stop and by adding gradient stops in the Gradient palette, you can create your own custom gradients.
Now you’ll paint some type that has been converted to paths with a linear gradient fill, and edit the colors in it.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), &lt;Shift&gt;-click each of the letters to group-select them in the type CHILES.
The CHILES type has already been converted to paths so you can fill it with a gradient.
(To convert type to paths, select it and choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.
See Lesson 8, "Working with Type," for more information.)

By grouping the letters, you’ll fill each individual letter with the same gradient at once.
Grouping them also makes it easier to edit the gradient fill globally.

Now you’ll add intermediate colors to the gradient to create a fill with multiple blends between colors.
You add a color to a gradient by adding a gradient stop.
When you add a new gradient stop, a diamond appears above the gradient bar to mark the colors’ new midpoint.
Click the <b>Edit Gradient icon</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientIcon.gif" alt="Edit gradient icon" width="26">), then with the <b>Edit Gradient</b> cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt="Edit gradient cursor" width="26">), double-click the middle of the <b>Edit gradient</b> tool bar.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Blending Intermediate Steps</span></h2>
In this section, you’ll create a series of blended shapes between three different-colored shapes on the outside of the bowl by specifying the number of steps in the blend and using the <b>Generate from Path - Interpolate</b> extension tool to create the blend.
First, group-select the red and yellow diamonds below the rim of the bowl with &lt;Shift&gt;-click.
Then, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path.
The <b>Interpolate</b> tool works only on paths, so any shape like a circle, square, or other shape created with a shape tool needs to be converted to a path in order for it to work smoothly.

These shape-blending results change more smoothly and predictably.
The blended decorations need to be properly spaced and aligned along a curve that parallels the edge of the bowl.
You will ungroup them (the objects are already partially grouped from the blending process), convert them to paths, put them on a straight-line path (called the skeleton), and then use the <b>Bend</b> tool to give the skeleton a curve.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Combining Blends with Gradients</span></h2>
You can blend objects that are filled with gradients to create different effects of color blending.
The two zigzag lines in the artwork are filled with gradients.
Now, you’ll blend the gradient-filled lines to create a multicolored blend in the artwork.
The theme of this particular design is a yellow stripe diagonally crossing an area of dark blue zigzag lines.
First, set guidelines on all four sides of the block of space that includes the two zigzag lines.
These guidelines will serve to reposition the filled block of zigzag lines you will create.

You have finished this tutorial on blending colors to make gradients and blending objects to make object blends.
You now have experience on combining the blending gradients and objects to enhance and broaden your graphic design skills.
Experiment with different widths of the yellow stripe, the length of the gradient tool bar, and adding different colors to the gradient.
Let this project serve as an initial idea of what you can do with color gradients and object blending.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
What is a gradient fill? Name two ways to fill a selected object with a gradient.
What is the difference between a gradient fill and a blend? How do you adjust the blend between colors in a gradient? How do you add colors to a gradient? How do you adjust the direction of a gradient? How do you blend the shapes and colors of objects together.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
A gradient fill is a graduated blend between two or more colors or tints of the same color.
Select an object and do one of the following: Click the <b>Linear gradient</b> button or <b>Radial gradient</b> button in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel to fill an object with the default white-to-black gradient or with the last selected gradient.
Click a gradient swatch in the gradient library palette, also in the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel.
Use the <b>Pick colors from image</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/DropperCursor.gif" alt="Pick colors icon" width="26">) to sample a gradient from an object in your artwork, and then apply it to the selected object.
The difference between a gradient fill and a blend is the way that colors combine together – colors blend together within a gradient fill and between objects in a blend.
You drag one of the gradient’s stops on the <b>Gradient</b> tool bar.
Double-click where you want to add the new color on the <b>Gradient</b> tool bar with the <b>Edit gradient</b> cursor active ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt="Edit gradient cursor" width="26">) active.
Then, with the <b>Gradient</b> tool icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/DropperCursor.gif" alt="Pick colors icon" width="26">) active, click on the color you want to add.
You click or drag the beginning or ending stop marker of the <b>Gradient</b> tool bar with the <b>Edit gradient</b> cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientCursor.gif" alt="Edit gradient cursor" width="26">) to adjust the direction of a gradient.
Make sure that the gradient stop marker you want is blue, showing that it is active.
Dragging a long distance changes colors gradually; dragging a short distance makes the color change more abrupt.
You first group-select the objects that will share a common gradient among them and press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to group them into one object.
While the grouped objects are still selected, bring up the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel, click on the <b>Linear gradient</b> button ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/LinearGradientButton.gif" alt="Linear gradient button" width="26">) or <b>Radial gradient</b> button ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/RadialGradientButton.gif" alt="Radial gradient button" width="26">), click on the <b>Edit gradient</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial11/images/EditGradientIcon.gif" alt="Edit gradient icon" width="26">), and then adjust colors and direction as you see fit.

The Spray tool lets you apply multiple objects by painting them onto the page.
The Spray tool offers options that make creating repetitive shapes, such as grass, or stars in the sky, easy and fun.
You can create 3-D objects using the Extrude tool and then map images that contain sprayed objects with the Envelope tool.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: Create an object to copy, clone, or transform into a path using the Spray tool.
Apply object instances using the Spray tool.
Modify and redefine an object instance.
Use sprayed object instances for 3D mapping.
Create a box shape using the Extrude tool.
Attach grouped objects to a box shape using the Envelope tool.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating an Object to Use with the Spray Tool</span></h2>
You create an object to be sprayed onto your artwork like any other object.
It acts, however, as the source for duplicates that you spray on as if you were using an air brush that sprays on droplets of paint, but not just colors.
For example, if you create an object in the shape of a blade of grass, you can then add instances of that grass multiple times to your artwork by spraying it on using the Spray tool.
When you click on the Spray tool icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/SprayToolIcon.gif" alt="Spray tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox, the <b>Spray Tool Controls Bar</b> appears above or to the right of the work window (depending on how you configured toolbar placement), presenting options to modify how the tool operates.

If you choose the <b>Spray <u>copies</u></b> option, you can spray on just copies of the original object.
Each copy is a stand-alone object that you can edit or replace independently of all the other copies.
If you later want to modify selected instances, you can, using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) and one or another technique of group-selection.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/CopyExample2.gif" alt="Example of spraying objects in copy mode" class="lazy">
In Copy mode, individual duplicated objects can be modified.
If you chose the <b>Spray <u>clones</u></b> option, then all clone instances are linked to the original source object.
This means that you can alter <u>all</u> instances by selecting the original instance, and then editing or replacing it – all instances of that object will be updated.
You can turn that grass from brown to green instantly! This tool can be a great time-saver as you create your artwork.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/CloneExample.gif" alt="Example of spraying objects in clone mode" class="lazy">
When Clone mode is used, duplicated objects are linked to their source object.
When a source object is modified, all corresponding sprayed objects are also modified.
Source object on the left, sprayed duplicates on the right.
If you choose to work with the <b><u>single path</u></b> option, then all duplicated objects become part of a single path.
If any of the sprayed objects overlap, the overlapping strokes are removed, creating the appearance that the objects have been merged (into a path union).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/SinglePathExample.gif" alt="Example of spraying objects in single path mode" class="lazy">

Inkscape objects that can be used are: paths, compound paths, text, raster images, mesh objects, and groups of objects.
You can use active objects, such as blends, effects, or other object instances that make up a larger object.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Mapping an Object to 3D Artwork</span></h2>
Objects can be mapped to 3D artwork to create labels and textures.
In this next section, you will create a cereal box with your baseball player on the front panel and a text object on the top and side.
Choose <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen, and open the <b>ballgame.svg</b> file you were working on earlier.
You are going to add a text label at the top of the image.
Select the Text tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/TextToolIcon.gif" alt="Text tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox, click anywhere on the work window to set the location of the text, and type SUPERSTAR.
The text will be the in the last font and in the last font size you used.
In the figure below, the font is sans-serif, normal, 12 pt.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Making a Three-dimensional Box Using the Extrude Tool</span></h2>
You can make boxes, cylinders, and other objects that allow you to make a prism out of a top and bottom geometric shape.
I recommend that you use it to create objects that have a sense of nearness to you, the observer.
If you want to create an object that gives the illusion of great size and distance from near point to far point, then you might achieve more desirable results using the Perspective Tool.
You will create a box where the observer’s point of view is from the top and to the front left side.
Draw a rectangle with the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/RectangleToolIcon.gif" alt="Rectangle tool icon" width="26">).

The duplicate quadrilateral (it does have four sides) lies topmost in the image stack, above the original quadrilateral.
Inkscape right now “thinks” that it is the front side of the box.
You need to send it to underneath the original so Inkscape will interpret it as the backside of the box.
Click on the <b>Lower selection to bottom</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/LowerSelectionToBottom.gif" alt="Lower selection to bottom icon" width="26">) in the Tools Control Bar.

Both quadrilaterals are objects and Inkscape “sees” them as such.
You need to transform them into paths and merge the paths into one item (one merged path) in order for the <b>Extrude</b> tool to work.
&lt;Shift&gt;-click the duplicate quadrilateral to group-select it with the original.
Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path to convert both quadrilaterals from objects into paths.
Then, with both paths selected, click on the <b>Group selected objects</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/GroupSelectedObjects.gif" alt="Group selected objects icon" width="26">) in the Tool Controls Bar to merge them into a single path item.
You will see no change in the paths or their bounding boxes, but Inkscape now recognizes them as a collection of connected nodes and paths, something that the <b>Extrude</b> tool can work with.

Now that the box has been created, we need to prepare its sides to receive images for the front, left, and top sides using the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
Note that the front and back sides are still selected (they have their bounding boxes).
The new sides are four paths that are merged into one group and are not selected.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Emplacing an Image on the Box Front Side Using the Envelope Tool</span></h2>
The 3-D box has been created.
It is now time to dress up its sides.
You will prepare the front side image of the box for use with the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
Like the <b>Extrude</b> tool, the <b>Envelope</b> tool also works with paths.
So, you’ll convert all the objects that make up the baseball player artwork from objects into paths.
Marquee-select the baseball player artwork to group-select all the objects that make it up.
Don’t forget that the upper part of the image is white and is part of the background.
Changing to <b>Outline</b> view might help.
If you don’t select everything at first, just click off the artwork to deselect it and then marquee-select again.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Working with Idiosyncratic Extrude Tool – Envelope Tool Interactions</span></h2>
In this section, you will mold the image that goes onto the top side of the box using the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
By thinking a problem through and experimenting with different options for orienting an image, you will find ways to overcome what looks like an insurmountable problem and break it down into a sequence of single and simple operations that allow you to obtain what you want in your design.
You will start this section by drawing a rectangle that has about the same size as the top face of the box.

Most of the work involves ungrouping levels of groups until you can finally access the bottommost image, which is the white rectangle that underlies the entire image.
Only then will you be able to apply a border that encompasses only the very edge of the front face.
Click on the front face with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">).
Then press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to ungroup the top level of objects that make up the face image.
Background faces, the baseball player, the text SUPERSTAR, and tufts of grasses have bounding boxes to indicate that they are now separate objects.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
What is the difference between the <b>Spray copies of the initial selection</b> mode and the <b>Spray clones of the initial selection</b> mode when using the Spray tool? Can you spray grouped objects? How? Does the <b>Extrude</b> tool work with objects, paths, or both? What can you do when an image is not emplaced properly on an extruded object? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
<b>Spray copies of the initial selection</b> mode allows you to make duplicates of the original source object or objects that are individual, stand-alone copies.
They can be treated as individual objects.
<b>Spray clones of the initial selection</b> mode allows you to make duplicates of the source objects that are connected or linked to the source objects.
So, if you modify one source object, all the linked clones are modified as well.
Yes, you can spray objects that have been grouped.
First, select the objects that you want to group, then press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to group them or click on the <b>Group selected objects</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/GroupSelectedObjects.gif" alt="Group selected objects icon" width="26">) in the Tool Controls Bar.
The <b>Extrude</b> tool works only with paths.
Convert an object to which you plan to add a third dimension into a path by selecting it, then choosing then <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path option.
Then use the <b>Extrude</b> tool.
There are four options available to you to resolve the emplacement problem.
Keep in mind that emplacement problems are problems of orientation which can be resolved one step at a time.
You might need to use each option one after another if the situation requires it.
Each time that you use a step, you can see how the orientation improves and comes closer to resolution.
If the transferred image is rotated by 90°, undo the transfer by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or clicking on the <b>Undo last action</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/UndoLastActionIcon.gif" alt="Undo last action icon" width="26">) in the Tool Controls Bar.
Choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>R</u>everse.
Then, reuse the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
If the transferred imaged is rotated by 180° either horizontally or vertically, undo the transfer (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or <b>Undo last action</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/UndoLastActionIcon.gif" alt="Undo last action icon" width="26">)), rotate the original image 180° horizontally or vertically as the situation requires, and then reemplace the image with the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
If the transferred image is a mirror image of the original where it has been flipped horizontally or vertically, undo the transfer (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or <b>Undo last action</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/UndoLastActionIcon.gif" alt="Undo last action icon" width="26">)).
Select the original image and then click on the <b>Flip selected objects horizontally</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/FlipHorizontallyIcon.gif" alt="Flip selected objects horizontally icon" width="26">) or <b>Flip selected objects vertically</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial12/images/FlipVerticallyIcon.gif" alt="Flip selected objects vertically icon" width="26">) as the situation requires.
Then, reemplace the image with the <b>Envelope</b> tool.
The emplaced image might have undergone both rotation and mirror-imaging.
Undo the emplacement and then test one or another of the options above until you see improvement in the image’s orientation.
Once you see what you want, then you will have conquered the beast.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 13, Part A – Creating Airbrush Effects</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/FinishedTutorialArtwork.gif" alt="Finished tutorial artwork" class="lazy">
Converting shapes into mesh objects lets you blend colors in multiple directions within the shapes for an aquarelle or airbrush effect.
It’s easy to modify mesh objects.
You can add or remove colors from points on the mesh to adjust the direction and amount of color blending.
This particular tutorial comes in three-parts – there is so much material on mesh gradients to cover.
Much of what is presented here is in pictures that take up a lot of space.
Their purpose is take make the learning process easier than if everything was just plain text.
As you go through this tutorial and the artwork develops as you scroll down, the imagery that you create might look similar enough to what you see here.
Absolute precision is not important — learning the methods and getting the feel of working and playing with them is.
Make the <b>Undo</b> function your friend.
If at first you don’t succeed, undo and try, try again! If you feel that your brain is full, take a break! I do.
And, have fun! In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: Create a mesh grid.
Apply colors to a mesh.
Edit a mesh for a variety of effects.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
In this tutorial, you’ll convert the shapes of two butterflies into meshes, paint them, and manipulate the color blending.
Before you begin, you will open the finished art file for the tutorial to see what you’ll create.
Start Inkscape.
Download file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/Tutorial13Aend.svg"><b>Tutorial13Aend.svg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location on your computer.
Note that the file image might look like one wing is missing when viewing it in its Internet source location.
There is a wing section — you might just be experiencing an incompatibility between the viewing software in your browser and the flavor of <b>svg</b> (scalable vector graphics) that Inkscape uses.
Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial13A_end.svg</b> file.
The missing wing should appear (along with everything else in the file).
If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen as you work.
If you don’t want to leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.
To begin working, you’ll open an existing art file.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Introduction to the Mesh Tool</span></h2>
Creating gradients using the Mesh tool is both a science and an art.
The science aspect involves creating a mesh grid with which you will define the geometry of the gradient borders and where different colors are to be positioned.
The art aspect involves your sense and sensibility of manipulating the mesh grid so the colors look the way you want them in terms of how they blend amongst each other to match what your imagination has produced.
The art of mesh gradients comes with experimenting, undoing and redoing mistakes, and just playing with the possibilities that appear on your mental computer screen.
First, you’ll paint a color on one of the tail wings on a butterfly.
You’ll start out with a simple mesh to get a basic feel for the Mesh tool, and then you’ll paint the other tail wing with the same colors.
Make a duplicate of the top butterfly’s lower left wing and move it to a side of the artboard to work on.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/CopyLowerRightWing.gif" alt="Making a copy of the butterfly's lower left wing" class="lazy">
Making a copy of the butterfly’s lower left wing.
Rotate the wind so that the tip of its tail is at the midpoint of the top line segment of the bounding box.
This orientation will make it a little easier to work with the Mesh grid.
Doing a preliminary step like rotating an object so its main axes of symmetry line up with the x-axis and y-axis of the work window is a wise thing to do.
It makes grid manipulation easier and can give you clearer insight into how you want to work with your coloration.

With the butterfly wing still selected (reselect if it isn’t), click on the <b>Create and edit meshes</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/CreateMeshToolIcon.gif" alt="Create and edit meshes tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox.
The Select tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/SelectionToolCursor.gif" alt="Selection tool cursor" width="26">) turns into the <b>Mesh tool</b> cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt="Mesh tool cursor" width="26">).
Double-click on the edge of the wing (<u>not</u> inside the wing) with the Mesh tool cursor to create the mesh grid.

Double-clicking on the edge of the wing.
Notice that grid points in the selected object are either solid diamonds or open circles.
Also, the object has a mesh point at the intersection of the two inside mesh lines, and two open circles between each pair of mesh points.
Mesh points define where the center of an area of color is located.
The open circles are mesh handles that allow you to change the shape of an area of color.
By moving the circles, you move the boundaries of an area of color to suit your preferences.
Each mesh point has at least two mesh handles associated with it.
Mesh points at the corners of the grid have two handles associated with them, mesh points on the grid sides but not on the corners have three handles associated with them, and mesh points inside the grid body have four mesh handles.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Moving Mesh Points and Mesh Handles</span></h2>

<h4>Moving a Single Mesh Point</h4>
When you move a mesh point, you move the center of an area of color associated with that center.
The mesh handles associated with that mesh point also move with that mesh point, keeping the same distance and orientation.
As a result, you move an entire area of color while maintaining its original shape, size and orientation.
With the Mesh tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt="Mesh tool cursor" width="26">) active, click on the middle mesh point.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/ClickOnCenterMeshPoint.gif" alt="Clicking on the center mesh point" class="lazy">
Clicking on the center mesh point.
The four mesh handles closest to the selected mesh point turn into arrows, all pointing toward the mesh point.
This feature is excellent for indicating which mesh point they’re associated with.
The arrows have a black stroke and white fill so they will always be visible, no matter what the underlying color is.
The center mesh point is colored blue, indicating that it is selected.
Click-drag the center mesh point to the center of the wing.
It does not have to be moved to the exact center.
See how the white area underneath the mesh point moves with the mesh point.
Also note how the four mesh handles, now arrows, move with the mesh point, maintaining their original distance and orientation.
Lastly, the central grid lines are now curved, especially the horizontal grid line, to maintain connection with the center mesh point.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/MoveCenterMeshPoint.gif" alt="Moving the center mesh point" class="lazy">

<h4>Moving Multiple Mesh Points</h4>
By &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on two or more mesh points with Mesh tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt="Mesh tool cursor" width="26">), you can group-select them as if you were using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) and moving them as a group.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z to undo the move until you get to where you were at Step 1 in the previous section with the middle mesh line straight across (you might have to press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z more than once).
Now, &lt;Shift&gt;-click the three mesh points on the middle mesh line to group-select them.
All three mesh points turn blue to indicate that they are selected.

Note that the three mesh handles associated with the rightmost mesh point on the middle mesh line are arrows, indicating that the rightmost mesh point was the last one selected and that it is still selected and active.
Click on the center mesh point.
It will stay selected (it remains blue).
However, the two side mesh points will deselect.
Now, click-drag the center mesh point right to the middle of the wing shape (you don’t have to be precise).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/SelectCenterPointDeselectSidePoints.gif" alt="Selecting the center mesh point and deselecting the side mesh points" class="lazy">
Selecting the center mesh point,
deselecting the side mesh points,
and moving the center mesh point
to the middle of the wing shape.
Note how the white patch and mesh handles follow the mesh point.
<b>Tip:</b> If you have a lot of mesh points that need to be moved, you might find that repositioned mesh handles can produce a confusing mess.
One way to reduce the confusion and frustration that can ensue involves moving the mesh handles for each mesh point closer in to the point.
So, when you move this and that point, the mesh handles stay in close proximity to the mesh point, allowing you to keep track of them more easily.
Once the mesh points are in place, you can then pull the handles away from their associated mesh point to restretch the color area into its proper geometry.
It’s almost like working with Silly Putty (if anybody remembers Silly Putty).
Below are three examples of how you can determine which mesh handles go to which mesh points, using the bottommost mesh points and handles, and the fact that the middle mesh line had been lowered.

Bottom right mesh point selected and
associated mesh handles activated.
The wind needs to have a black border and a deep purple center.
Making the black border is more challenging than making the purple center.
Also, by keeping the wing’ center white, it will be easy to shape the black border by virtue of stronger color contrast, compared to working with a deep or dark purple center and, thus, less contrast between colors.
Start on the black border by moving the mesh handles associated with the three bottom mesh points closer to their respective points.
Click on the bottom center mesh point.
Its associated mesh handles turn into arrows.
Note that the bottom mesh points have their upper mesh handles located above the mesh handles associated with the mesh points on the middle mesh line.
You can verify this upside-down orientation by clicking on a mesh point on the middle mesh line and then clicking on a bottom mesh point.
This orientation happened when you moved the middle mesh line down from its original central position in Step 3 above.
The mesh handles maintained their original relationship to their mesh points.
Move the mesh handles closer in for each mesh point on the bottom line.
Note that an arrow fill turns red when the mesh tool cursor hovers over it.

Bottom line mesh points now have handles moved in closer.
The right-hand mesh handle is the last one moved in the first figure.
Its color fill is red because the mesh tool cursor is still hovering over it.
The grey color in the lower right corner of the figure has become subtley darker.
The two mesh handles that belong to the bottom right mesh point have been moved away from their original area of influence where they help define a patch of white color.
That white color patch still exists but it is now more restricted to the very near neighborhood of its mesh point, which is off the wing shape.
Move the bottom mesh points individually up to the wing figure so that they bring the whole bottom mesh line up to closely approximate the geometry of the that part of the wing.
Note how the coloration changes in response to the new placement of the mesh points with their close-in mesh handles.
Also, when a segment of the mesh line moves to inside the figure, it creates a white-filled patch defined by the outer border of the figure itself and the inner mesh line.
You will correct this discrepancy in painting shortly.

You will now paint the bottom edge of the wing black.
With the Mesh tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt="Mesh tool cursor" width="26">) still active, click on the bottom left mesh point to select it.
Then, click on the black swatch in the Color palette at the bottom of the work window.
Select and paint the center and right bottom mesh points black, also.

Select the center bottom mesh point with the Mesh tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/MeshToolCursor.gif" alt="Mesh tool cursor" width="26">).
Click drag the right-hand mesh handle to verify that the curvature of the curve segment between the center and right-hand points aligns with the curve of the wing shape.
It is alright if the grid curve is outside of the wing a little bit.
See how the handle arrow points along the curve, causing the curve of the mesh grid to follow the curve of the wing at the point.
You will notice if the grid curve is inside the wing  – because of the odd area of white.
With the bottom center mesh point still selected, pull down the left-hand handle to see the grid curve to the left.
There is no difference in the grid curvature when you pull the handle down, so release the mouse key and press &lt;Shift&gt;-Z to undo the move and bring the mesh handle to its original position.

Note how the black edging extends upwards to the mesh point.

You will now paint the wing tail.
Magnify the area at the top of the mesh grid to see the mesh layout better.

Magnified view of the wing tail.
Click on the left-hand mesh point and then click on the black swatch in the Color palette to set the point’s color to black.
The mesh point is far enough away from the wing tail that its contribution to the black edging is not noticeable.
You’ll change that situation shortly.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/WingTailBlack1.gif" alt="Wing tail" class="lazy">

Now you see discernible progress! 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/WingTailBlack3.gif" alt="Wing tail" class="lazy">
Painting the right side of the wing tail black.
The image below is what you have created so far.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13A/images/WingTailBlack4.gif" alt="Wing tail" class="lazy">
The whole lower right wing
as it is painted now.
Now you’ll change the curvature of the left, center, and right mesh lines so that they’ll conform to the geometry of the wing tail.
By creating a color fill to the tail this way, you will have better control over how colors blend from one to another inside the mesh grid, and thus, inside the wing.
First, magnify the top area of the mesh grid so you’ see better what you’ll be doing.
Then, move all the mesh handles inward toward their respective mesh points.
You’ll be moving mesh points, so you’ll need to keep mesh handles together in distinct and recognizable groups to keep them manageable.

Magnifying the wing tail to move mesh handles close to their mesh points.
Move the left and right mesh points in toward the center mesh point to start moving the left and right mesh lines in toward the wing tail.
Note that the right mesh line cuts into the wing tail, slicing off part of its length.
You’ll take care of that shortly.

Moving wing tail mesh lines in so they converge near the tail tip.
You will now do some coarse-adjusting of the right-hand mesh line.
Click-drag the lower mesh handle of the right mesh point down and to the right a little to get a feel for how that handle affects the placement of the mesh line.
Also, see how the mesh line differentially slices off the right side of the wing tail as you move the handle.

Current right-hand mesh line cutting off part of wing tail.
Move the mesh handle up, noting how the curvature of the mesh line changes as you approach the upper mesh point.
Once you see that the mesh line has moved away from the wing tail so the tip appears in its entirety, you can stop moving the mesh handle.
The mesh line now conforms much better to the geometry of the tail tip, and the tip is all black.

A good next step is to change the orientation of the central ray of white color fill that comes out and up from the central mesh point.
You want the direction of the ray to follow the general inclined upward trend of the wing shape.
To start, move the mesh handles of the central mesh point in close.

central mesh point prior to moving.
Magnify the top of the mesh grid so you can see the top center mesh point and its handles clearly.
Click-drag the lower mesh handle of the top center mesh point down, following the curve of the wing tail.
Again, note how the mesh handle, now a red active arrow, stays pointed toward its associated mesh point.

Fine-tune using the mesh handle belonging to the central mesh point.
You might find yourself alternately moving both mesh handles until you get a good-trending center vertical mesh line.
The figure below provides a good idea of what you’re striving for.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
In this tutorial, you’ll continue working the art file that you began in the previous tutorial.
Start Inkscape if you exited it.
Download file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13B/Tutorial13B_end.svg"><b>Tutorial13B_end.svg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location on your computer.
Note that the file image might look like there are wing parts missing when viewing it in its Internet source location.
There are wing parts — you might just be experiencing an incompatibility between the viewing software in your browser and the flavor of <b>svg</b> (scalable vector graphics) that Inkscape uses.
Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial13B_end.svg</b> file.
The missing wing parts should appear (along with everything else in the file).
If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen as you work.
If you don’t want to leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.
To begin working, File &gt; Open file <b>Butterfly.svg</b>, which you worked on in Tutorial 13A.

Move the outer mesh points in until they just touch the edge of the wing or lie just outside the shape.
Move the inner mesh points to create mesh lines that roughly align with the shape of the wing.
Move mesh handles out as you see fit to bring color to the edges of the wing but not totally removing the black edging.
How you do this is up to you and how you feel or think the different patches of color should look.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Highlighting Using a Mesh</span></h2>
To give an object a three-dimensional appearance, you can create a gradient mesh that highlights the center or the edge of an object.
Now you’ll create a 3 &amp;mult; 3 mesh with highlighting.
Scroll down the artboard to bring the second butterfly to the center of the work window.

There are two smoothing algorithms available for you to experiment with.
There is the <b>Coons</b> algorithm and the <b>Bicubic</b> algorithm.
The Coons algorithm can produce abrupt changes in color between color patch borders.
The bicubic algorithm spreads color changes out over greater distances, significantly reducing the rate of color change and color banding.
The decision of which algorithm to use depends upon your taste in coloration.
They are available in the <b>Mesh Tool Controls Bar</b>.
The two figures below use the same gradient grid but different algorithms.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Editing Mesh Points</span></h2>
You can use the Mesh tool to select and add mesh points to change the way colors blend in a gradient mesh.
Every mesh point has a set of direction handles that let you adjust the distance and direction that a color blends with neighboring colors in the mesh grid.
In this section, you’ll use the Mesh tool to create a mesh point in the tail wing on the butterfly and then change the direction in which the color of the mesh point blends from the corner.
Click on the <b>Create meshes</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13B/Tutorial13B/images/CreateMeshToolIcon.gif" alt="Create and edit meshes tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox.

Yes, the end is in sight! Be comfortable using the <b>Undo</b> function and the <b>Zoom</b> function.
The <b>Undo</b> function makes it very easy to retrace your steps if something doesn’t look the way it should.
The <b>Zoom</b> function allows for deep, up-close viewing of fine-detail work – it’s a great magnifying glass when needed, and a great telescope when also needed.

Setting the wing opacity to 29%.
Here is a neat technique for replacing the original dragonfly wing with the new transparent version.
Select the original wing.
Set its border to black to by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the black swatch in the Color palette at the bottom of the work window.
Make the fill absolutely transparent by clicking on the <b>none</b> swatch next to the black swatch.
Move the tranparent wing closer to the original wing and rotate it so it has roughly the same orientation as the original.

With the new wing object still selected, click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13C/Tutorial13C/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) once or twice to place it underneath the black outline.
Press the &lt;Esc&gt; key to deselect the wing.
Then, select the black edge of the wing and press the &lt;Del&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; key to delete it.
If you accidentally delete the transparent wing instead, then press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z to undo the mistake and press the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon again.
Click off the artwork to deselect the wing.
Select the black edge of the wing again.
Press the &lt;Del&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; key again.
If the black outline disappears, then good.
Otherwise, repeat the previous few steps until you successfully delete the black outline.
Select the lower right wing with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13C/Tutorial13C/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">).

You have now learned how to create and modify mesh gradients, and finally, how to add transparency to objects that have mesh gradients attached to them.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
How do you add transparency to a mesh gradient? Can you add transparency to multiple objects? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
You add transparency to an mesh gradient object just like adding transparency to any other object.
Choose Objects &gt; Fill and Stroke…, click on the <b>Fill</b> tab, click on the <b>Mesh gradient</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial13C/Tutorial13C/images/MeshGradientIcon.gif" alt="Mesh gradient icon" width="26">), and adjust the <b>Opacity (%)</b> bar to the percent opacity that you want.
Yes, you can group-select multiple objects using the marquee-select technique or by &lt;Shift&gt;-click on disparate objects.
You then set the transparency for all the selected objects.
They will all have the same degree of transparency.

Inkscape has painting features that simulate strokes done with a charcoal pencil, paint brush, marker, and more.
Line tapering options of the Pen and Pencil tools allow for controlled thickening and thinning of middles and ends of line segments, adding flourish and a touch of elegance to the overall design of the artwork.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: How to work with the Pencil tool’s Triangle in and Triangle out features to create a tapering path.
How to create a custom charcoal pencil filter.
How to add a charcoal pencil effect to a path.
How to scatter objects along a path.
How to simulate drawing with an edged marker pen.
How to fill a blank area enclosed fully or partially by a curved line segment.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
In this tutorial, you will apply different styles of paint brush and drawing pencil to a template file that contains the paths that you will trace over and apply brush effects to.
This tutorial is the first to two parts that explore the use of painting and drawing with the aim of stylizing what you draw.
Take your time exploring the different techniques and tools, become familiar with their capabilites and limitations, and include them in your toolbox of means to enhancing your skills as a graphic artist.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Using Art Brush Tools</span></h2>
Art brushes stretch artwork evenly along a path.
They include strokes resembling various graphic media, such as the Chalk and Sponge, and Marker brushes.
Brush tools don&amp;rsqou;t exist as a distinct central palette of tools in Inkscape.
Instead, they are distributed throughout Inkscape&amp;rsqou;s organization of features.
In this section, you’ll create and apply a custom charcoal brush to draw the trunk and limbs of a tree in a way that imitates using a charcoal pencil.
The start file has been created with guides that you can use to create and align your artwork for this tutorial.
They are locked and cannot be selected, moved, modified, or printed (unless they are unlocked).
The guides in the illustration above are very light (that is how they are in the original file).
They will be darkened a bit in the rest of this tutorial so you can see them more easily.

<h4>Applying a Tapered Stroke Effect to a Path</h4>
You’ll start by drawing the trunk of the tree in a two-step process.
The first step involves tracing over the two trunk guides using the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt="Pencil tool icon" width="26">).
Select the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt="Pencil tool icon" width="26">).
In the <b>Pencil Tool Control Bar</b>, set <b>Smoothing</b> to <b>20</b> and <b>Shape</b> to <b>Triangle in</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/SelectTriangleIn.gif" alt="Selecting Triangle in" class="lazy">
Setting <b>Smoothing</b> to <b>20</b> and <b>Shape</b> to <b>Triangle in</b>.
The <b>Smoothing</b> function acts to reduce the small-scale bumps and irregularities that commonly appear in a line or curve that you draw using the Pencil tool.
The <b>Smoothing</b> function allows you to make a line or curve smooth by adjusting the smoothing factor from 1 to 100.
A smoothing factor of 1 keeps all the small bumps and jitters that the hand produces.
As you increase the smoothing factor, small-scale deviations are reduced in size until you achieve an essentially straight line, no matter how jiggly the line is.
A few examples below demonstrate how the smoothing function works:

Examples of smoothing.
Drag the Pencil tool cursor up for the left side of the trunk and down for the right side.

Three nodes appear on the line, two of which are at the starting point.
One of the latter two nodes terminates the main trace or spine of the line.
The other is a width handle that allows you to change how wide the line is at the starting point.

<h4>Creating a Custom Filter with the Filter Editor</h4>
<b>What Is a Filter?</b> A <b>filter</b> or <b>filter effect</b> is one or more mathematical operations that a graphics program, such as Inkscape, applies to something that you have drawn — a star, a tree, a dragonfly wing, etc.
— and produces a modified result — a star with a halo, a tree drawn with a charcoal pencil, a transparent wing that shows what lies underneath, etc.
All the math is done behind the scenes.
What’s important is the visual result on your screen, the print-out on good stationery, or added to a video scene.
The filtering process starts out with a <i>source graphic</i>, your original drawing.
The filter program first analyzes the color fills, strokes, paths, and other attributes that contribute to the drawing and then transforms at least one of the attributes according to how the filter is put together.
Below are a few examples of source graphics that have a filter applied to them.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/FilterExamples.gif" alt="Filter examples" class="lazy">

Selecting the <b>Turbulence</b> primitive.
<b>What Is a Filter Primitive?</b> When a filter is created that does several things to its associated source graphic, it is commonly convenient to take very simple filter components and link them together so that the graphic output from one serves as the input for the next.
These components are called <b>filter primitives</b>.
They commonly do just one simple thing, such as creating a blur, moving (displacing) pixels to a new location, tile multiple copies of the original source image (source graphic), and introducing different types of visual noise.
Inkscape allows you to construct new filters using its Filter editor.
You can modify original images you make that are otherwise difficult or inconvenient to construct using tools in the toolbox.
Once the new filter has been constructed, all you need to do is select the source graphic, make a couple of selections, and the result appears immediately.
Click on the <b>Add Effect:</b> button.
The bounding box is now filled with a random pattern.

Adding the Turbulence primitive to the Effect panel.
Although the explanatory text is partially cut off, it reads, in its entirety: <b>The <i>feTurbulence</i> filter primitive renders Perlin noise.
This kind of noise is useful in simulating several nature phenomena like clouds, fire and smoke and in generating complex textures like marble or granite.</b> Below are examples of Perlin noise: 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/perlin_raw1.jpg" alt="Example 1 of Perlin noise" class="lazy" width="200">

<h4>Using the Spray Tool As a Brush</h4>
When you spray art objects along a guide or path, you are using the Spray tool as if it were a paint brush.
Objects can be sprayed directly onto a path or splashed on so that the result is a scattering of objects, yet still centered along the path, like leaves swept into rows or sand grains aligned in ripples.
In this section, you will paint leaves along the tree branches in a very loose manner using the Spray tool.
Select the leaf image to the right of the artboard with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">).

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Collecting Tapered Pencil Strokes to Simulate a Single Paintbrush Stroke</span></h2>
One way to imitate brush strokes involves drawing individual lines made by the camel hairs of the brush tip and collecting them together into one tip of any width.
You can also use this technique to create tufts of grass, which is the task of this section.
You will start this section by adding a new layer ontop of the <b>Tree and Leaves</b> layer.
Expand the iconified <b>Layers</b> dialog box, add a new layer, and label it <b>Grass</b>.
Also, lock the <b>Tree and Leaves</b> layer so you won’t accidentally modify your earlier work.

When you select the <b>Envelope Deformation</b> path effect, a bounding box encloses the object you want to transform.
You can adjust each side of the box, which is a <i>bend path</i> by selecting the appropriate icon in the <b>Path Effects</b> dialog box, and then changing the bend of the side and/or moving the nodes that define the ends of the line segment.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing with the Pencil Tool’s Ellipse Shape and the Bucket Fill Tool</span></h2>
You will learn how to work with the Pen tool’s ellipse shape option to draw the outline of the boat.
Then, you will learn how to use the Bucket Fill tool in color fill in the space within an unclosed curve.
First, create a new layer ontop of the <b>Grass</b> layer you just created earlier.
Label it <b>Boat and Rope</b>.
Select the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt="Pencil tool icon" width="26">).
In the <b>Pencil Tool Control Bar</b>, set <b>Smoothing</b> to <b>20</b> and <b>Shape</b> to <b>Ellipse</b>.
Using the guides, click-drag the Pencil tool along the nearer edge of the top of the boat, and keeping the left mouse key depressed, continue drawing along the bottom of the boat back to the starting point.
Note that there is a very thin line showing where you had drawn.
While you draw, you will note irregularities in the curvature of the line trace because of your hand jiggling a little bit or the cat running interference against your arm and hand.
The <b>Smoothing</b> function will eliminate many of the irregularities because you set its level to <b>20</b>.
You’ll smooth the remaining irregularities out shortly.
If you’re not satisfied with the result, you can always undo the last with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z or by choosing Edit &gt; Undo and start over.

Click-drag the Thickness handle in toward the starting node to which it is attached to make the curve thinner.
The Thickness handle can be very sensitive to movement, so it might be helpful to magnify the artwork so you can control the handle’s movement more easily.

The color fill area is placed above its bounding curve in the image stack.
You can now reshape the fill area by adjusting its nodes and node handles so that it overlaps the curve slightly, eliminating any spurious opening spaces between fill area and bounding curve.
Adjust any nodes and node handles to create a slight overlap.
At the left end of the fill area, pull the area to the left a little to fill the gap between the starting point and the ending point better.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Final Word Before Chapter 14, Part B</span></h2>
Using brush techniques to texture how strokes, line segments, and curves look is a broad subject that is way beyond the scope of this tutorial.
The techniques that you have learned up to this point can already serve you very well in creating artwork that invites the visitor to look more closely, and enjoy both the small details and how they weave themselves into the larger picture.
The next tutorial, Tutorial 14B, explores how to fill a space with Inkscape pen and pencil scribble techniques, and how to apply them to texture the appearance of text, to where it is no longer a string of letters, but text stylized to capture and hold your viewer’s attention through your inventiveness.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
What are tools that can be used as pencils or brushes? What is the difference between a filter and a filter primitive? What is the function of the Spray tool? How do you make ellipse shapes visible when using the Pencil tool? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
Inkscape has available the Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt="Pencil tool icon" width="26">), the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">), the Spray tool, the Calligraphy tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/CalligraphyToolIcon.gif" alt="Calligraphy tool icon" width="26">), and the Paint Bucket tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PaintBucketToolIcon.gif" alt="Paint Bucket tool icon" width="26">).
The Pencil tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PencilToolIcon.gif" alt="Pencil tool icon" width="26">) allows you to draw or trace along a guide as if you were using an actual pencil.
You can stylize what you draw using the Triangle in, Triangle out, and Ellipse options, among others.
The Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">) allows you to draw simple or stylized curves in addition to lines and edit them as you draw using nodes and node handles.
The Paint Bucket tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/PaintBucketToolIcon.gif" alt="Paint Bucket tool icon" width="26">) lets you fill in spaces according to criteria that you specify in the Paint Bucket Tool Control Bar.
A filter is an operation or process that alters an image that already has been drawn or painted, that is, an <u>original</u> or <u>source</u> graphic image.
The filter adds something extra to the image, such as giving it a blur, a shadow, a glow, or a change in shape.
A filter primitive is a filter that performs commonly just one operation.
It can be considered a simple piece that can be added or linked together with other simple "filter pieces" or components using a filter editor to create a graphic operation that can perform complex actions on a source graphic.
The Spray tool can be thought of as a type of brush that brushes objects (or copies of an object) onto the workspace, much like dipping a paint brush into some glue, and then into a collection of objects, such as leaves, confetti, or raindrop shapes, and then brushing them onto a canvas.
The number of objects sprayed on, the spray area around the Spray tool cursor, and other attributes are adjustable in the <b>Spray Tool Controls Bar</b>.
After you have drawn your shape with the Pencil or Pen tool, select the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">).
The curve (or curve spine), nodes, node handles, and the Thickness handle appear, allowing adjustment of curve position and thickness.
When color filling the curve, use the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) to view the color fill.
When making fine adjustments to the curve, you might find yourself switching between the views furnished by the Select tool and Node tool — the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) allowing you to see coloration, and the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14A/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">) allowing you to see structural controls for the curve.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing Rope Using the <i>Pattern Along Path</i> Function</span></h2>
Drawing rope seems to be a simple task of taking a single roll of cord and duplicating it along the length of a path that represents the rope itself.
To make a length of rope in which all the rolls fit into each other in a continuous sequence can be tedious, however, requiring an understanding of symmetry and how to make it work for you.
The tedium is reduced when you break the task down into smaller steps that are easier to manage.
The ability to take a large problem and reduce it into a collection of smaller, simpler steps is a very important skill to cultivate in graphic design.
You can create very sophisticated and awe-inspiring artwork when you use critical thinking like this.
You will make a length of doubled rope that is tied to the boat and leads up to the trunk of the tree.
Then, you will make a visually separate length of rope that circles the trunk of the tree.
First, select the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">) and create a smooth curve that follows the guideline from the boat to the knot at the tree trunk.
Click on a starting point of the rope guideline and drag the Pen tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/PenToolCursor.gif" alt="Pen tool cursor" width="26">) out in the direction that the curve is to go.

Click on the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">).
Position the Node tool cursor over the rope curve until the hand icon appears.
Click-drag the curve out until it matches the curvature of the guideline underneath.
Adjust with the two direction handles at either end of the curve for fine adjustment, if necessary.

You will now transform the rope curve into a path that represents a doubled rope, that is, a rope path that doubles back on itself smoothly at each end.
Select the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) and choose Objects &gt; Fill and Stroke….
Click on the <b>Stroke style</b> tab, enter a <b>Width</b> of <b>3.2 px</b>, and click on the <b>Round cap</b> button ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RoundCapButton.gif" alt="Round cap button" width="26">).

With the curve still selected, choose Path &gt; Stroke to Path.
You will see nothing different in the curve, but Inkscape now “sees” the curve only as a simple curve without any previous shape information that it was a line segment.
Select the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">) to view the nodes that demarcate the newly created path from the curve stroke.

The path doubles back on itself at the ends.
The <b>Round cap</b> option that you selected earlier creates smooth turn-arounds that the coils that you will shortly make can follow, enhancing the flexible look of rope.

<b><u>Do not</u></b> choose Path &gt; <u>Object to Path</u>.
You will get spurious rope coils that do not appear right when you apply the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function later in this tutorial.
The path is now ready to receive the pattern of a rope coil that will be duplicated along the path’s length.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing Rope — How to Analyze a Complex Shape</span></h2>

<h4>The Geometry of Rope</h4>
When one thinks of rope, one envisions a cord of any length consisting of coiled cotton, nylon, wire, or any other material that can make lengths of strong, usually resilient material.
See below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RopePic1.jpg" alt="Rope example 1" class="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RopePic2.jpg" alt="Rope example 2" class="lazy">
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RopePic3.webp" alt="Rope example 3" width="600" class="lazy">
The examples above have one feature in common: they all are made of coiled material.
That basic coil feature, we’ll call it a <b>motif</b>, is repeated along the length of the rope and informs us, when we see it, that we are looking at cord or rope.
It is our challenge to replicate that coiled look to inform the person viewing our artwork that he or she is looking at rope or cord.
Here is where geometry, the study of shapes, comes in handy to inform our sense of how to do precise design.
By the way, this section does not discuss geometry as is done in a mathematics course.
We do need, however, to look closely at shapes with an analytical frame of mind so that we can create the kind of imagery that has meaning and makes sense to the viewer.
We’ll start by looking at the drawing of a piece of rope.
Let’s look at a section of rope or cord up close.
The small-scale feature that leaps out of the picture is the coils.
These coils all look exactly alike.
As a graphic designer, this repetition of shape is a geometric constraint, a limit if you will, that will help us immensely.
If you consider one coil, you consider them all.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory1.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
A section of rope.
These coils are not just exact replicas of each other, their sides are curved just right so that they fit exactly against each other.
This is another constraint that can help us understand how this kind of repetitive design works.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory2.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Each coil has matching side curvature.
Another characteristic of the coils is that they still look exactly alike when they are rotated 180 degrees.
This feature is called <i>two-fold rotational symmetry</i>.
Two-fold, three-fold, four-fold, and six-fold symmetry are terms used in geometry, engineering, crystallography, and other analytical disciplines that use symmetry as a tool for understanding and communicating about shapes.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory3.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Two-fold rotational symmetry.
Because coils have two-fold rotational symmetry and their sides have the same curvature, each side has two-fold symmetry across its midpoint.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory4.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Opposite sides having the same curvature.
As a result, we need to consider only one half of a coil’s shape.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory5.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
The lower half of the sequence of coils can be removed with no loss of design information.
With the lower half of the coils removed, we still see the repetitive symmetry of the upper half, and that opposite sides still match.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory6.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Top half of coils, all important shape information still present.
The exact sameness of the sides, and the top, of each coil allows us to divide a coil-half into two complementary halves, as drawn in the figure below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory7.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Each coil half divided into two complementary halves.
When the coil halves are placed next to each other, a simpler symmetry appears.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory8.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Regrouping coil halves to highlight a simpler symmetry.
For simplicity’s sake (pun intentional), consider just one coil half.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory9.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
One upper half of a coil.
Move the lower left section of the coil half to the lower right.
Because the two sides have the exact same curvature, they fit together exactly.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory11.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Exact fit of opposing sides.
The two combined sides make the curved diagonal of a rectangle.
The curved top of the rectangle and the curved diagonal can be straightened out.
Now we can see how, by simplifying a complex shape into basic components of simpler symmetry, we can understand how the original shape is put together and, importantly, how we can use Inkscape tools and functions to construct that shape out of motifs of simple symmetry.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory12.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Curved diagonal to straight diagonal.
The simplest two-dimensional shape that ends this train of thought is the triangle.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Theory13.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
The simplest 2-D shape.
This section can serve as an introduction to the theory of graphic design.
The main point is the importance of critical thinking, which in this case, helps you to take a complicated problem, like a rope coil, divide it into smaller, more manageable parts, and use those pieces to understand what is happening behind the scenes in terms of geometry, symmetry, and what Inkscape can do for you in drawing them.
If you don’t like mathematics, there is no problem here.
You are working strictly with shapes.
Numbers will help when you need them, but for now, the ability to envision using your mental screen and Inkscape on an actual screen is what’s important.
Then, let the power of your imagination take over.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing Rope — Using Shape Analysis to Guide Your Drawing</span></h2>
Now that you know what’s involved with doing shape analysis, you will use your newly acquired insight to draw a length of rope showing visible coils.
This section is a variation on the theme of the last section, the variation being that you will go through the last section from end to beginning, using Inkscape to draw each step of the way until you have created a full length of rope.
The rope starts with a triangle.
Draw a triangle using the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">).
The triangle drawn below has a long leg of 11 pixels’ length and the short leg is 9 pixels long.
These measurements are not hard and fast — we chose them arbitrarily to make a nice-looking coil, and thus a nice-looking length of rope.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope01.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
The starting triangle.
The coil will eventually be colored before creating the final length of rope.
At this time, we need a color (we chose Fuchsia here) to see the triangle and differentiate from the other pieces of the coil shape that we’ll create shortly.
Choose <b>none</b> for the stroke color.
We’ll give the final coil shape a stroke color later.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope02.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Fuchsia color fill, no color for the stroke.
Select the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">), and then click on the triangle with the Node tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/NodeToolCursor.gif" alt="Node tool cursor" width="26">).
Corner nodes and thin lines appear, ready for manipulation.

Triangle in Node tool view.
Move the Node tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/NodeToolCursor.gif" alt="Node tool cursor" width="26">) to the hypotenuse (the longest leg) until a hand icon appears next to the cursor.
The hand means that the cursor is now above an object that can be manipulated by the tool.
Click on the hypotenuse to select it and then click-drag it a little to the upper left to give it a gentle curve.
(By how much is up to you.) This curve will generate both the left and right side curves of the coil.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope04.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Creating the first curve on the coil motif.
Repeat the previous step with the top (long) leg of the triangle also, to give it a gentle curve.
This curve will serve as the top and bottom parts of the coil shape, demarcating where the rope stops and the rest of the artwork begins.
Right now, it just looks like a stylized eagle claw — but not for long! 
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope05.gif" alt="" class="lazy">

This shape represents one quarter of the full shape of the coil.
Choose the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">).
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the claw shape.
Then, click away from the artwork to deselect it.
If the <b>Snap Tool Bar</b> is not active, then choose View &gt; Show/Hide.
Check the <b>Snap Controls Bar</b> checkbox to activate the <b>Snap Tool Bar</b>.
Click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b>, <b>Snap nodes, paths, and handles</b>, and <b>Snap to cusp nodes, incl.

Snap controls bar with selected snapping functions highlighted.
You will now make the complementary half of the coil shape that will connect at the left of the “eagle’s talon” shape.
Start by selecting the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RectangleToolIcon.gif" alt="Rectangle tool icon" width="26">).
Click-drag the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RectangleToolIcon.gif" alt="Rectangle tool icon" width="26">) diagonally across the claw shape to cover it with a rectangle.
Let the top curve remain uncovered.
We turned the View &gt; Page Grid feature off — it is no longer necessary.
We chose blue for the fill color of the rectangle from the Color palette so that it is distinguishable from the talon shape.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope07.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Drawing a rectangle.

Rectangle drawn.
(View &gt; Page Grid turned off) You have created an image stack, consisting of two talon shapes at the bottom and in the middle, and the rectangle at the top.
Consider them as three pieces of tracing paper, each with an image on it, and in a bottom-to-top stacking order.
You can change that order.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope09.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Current image stack.
With the rectangle still selected, click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/LowerSelection1Step.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) to move the rectangle to the middle of the image stack.
Note that a talon shape has appeared on top of the rectangle.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope10.gif" alt="" class="lazy">

The rectangle lowered by one level
in the image stack.
You will now divide the image stack into two parts: the original talon shape and the complementary part of the rectangle <u>not underneath</u> the talon.
You will use the <b>Path difference</b> function to do this.
With the rectangle still selected (reselect it if it has been deselected), choose Path &gt; Object to Path.
This step is necessary for what’s coming up.
&lt;Shift&gt;-click in the talon shape to group-select it with the rectangle.
You will see two horizontal bounding box line segments: one demarcating the top of the rectangle, and the other touching the curved top of the overlying talon shape.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope12.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Group-selecting the rectangle and talon shapes.
The <b>Path difference</b> function operates by taking the top of two path objects and using it like a cookie-cutter on the shape underneath.
The operation eliminates the cookie-cutter shape but keeps the shape that was cut.
The <b>Path difference</b> function does not work on regular objects; it works <u>only</u> on paths.
So, before using this function, make sure that both the cookie-cutter top shape has been converted into a path and the object underneath has also been converted using Path &gt; Object to Path or Path &gt; Stroke to Path, depending on the kind of object that needs to be converted.
Then, do your cookie-cutting.
Choose Path &gt; Difference.
Click-drag the lower shape away from the talon.
The duplicate talon that cookie-cut the rectangle has been eliminated, but the original talon at the bottom of the image stack remains.
This technique of duplicating an image and using one as a cookie-cutter is great for creating shapes that need to complement each other’s geometry and where you need both shapes available.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope13.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Talon shape and complement, both showing
their common side curve.
Move the lower shape to the left of the talon shape so that it attaches.
Inkscape’s snapping function will pull the talon shape into position so that it attaches cusp-to-cusp with exact precision.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope14.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Joining the complementary shape to the left side of the talon shape.
This shape now represents one half of the full shape of the coil.
With the left-hand shape still selected, &lt;Shift&gt;-click the talon shape to group-select with the first shape.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G to group the two shapes.
They are now enclosed within one bounding box, not two.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope15.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Grouping the two shapes.
With the group still selected, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate it.
Move the duplicate grouped shape to the side and then click on the <b>Rotate selection 90° clockwise</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Rotate90clockwise.gif" alt="Rotate selection 90 degrees clockwise icon" width="26">) <u>twice</u> or the <b>Rotate selection 90° counter-clockwise</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/Rotate90counterclockwise.gif" alt="Rotate selection 90 degrees counter-clockwise icon" width="26">) <u>twice</u> to rotate the shape by 180 degrees.

Attaching the lower object to the upper object.
You how have the full shape of the coil.
It is now time to turn it into a single path in preparation for use in Inkscape’s <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function.
Inkscape “sees” the coil shape as two groupings of objects, each grouping containing two objects.
&lt;Shift&gt;-click on each group to group-select them and then click on the <b>Ungroup selected objects</b> button ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/UngroupObjectsIcon.gif" alt="Ungroup selected objects icon" width="26">) in the <b>Command Tools Bar</b> to ungroup them.
Each object is now enclosed in its own bounding box.

Ungrouping the four objects that make up the coil shape.
Now is a good time to change the fill color of the four objects.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), select the upper right object, choose Object &gt; Fill and Stroke… &gt; Fill tab, and set the object’s fill color to light blue (<b>bbbbffff</b> in the <b>RGBA</b> text box).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope19.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Giving the top right object a light blue fill color.
Change the remaining objects’ fill color to light blue.
Start by selecting the next object to the left.
Then, select the <b>Dropper</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/DropperToolIcon.gif" alt="Dropper tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox.
Position the <b>Dropper</b> tool cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/DropperToolCursor.gif" alt="Dropper tool cursor icon" width="26">) over the light blue object.

Selecting the object to recolor and positioning the <b>Dropper</b> tool cursor
over the light blue object to sample its fill color.
Click on the light blue object to sample its color.
The other object already selected receives the same light blue fill color.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope21.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Clicking on the light blue object to sample its color.
Repeat the previous two steps for the remaining two objects.

Remaining two objects receiving a light blue fill color.
You will now convert the four objects that make up the rope coil motif into paths.
Marquee-select the whole coil shape to group-select the four individual objects that make it up and choose Path &gt; Object to Path.
There is no visible difference, but Inkscape now “sees” each object only as a collection of lines and curves.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope23.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Converting the four objects into four individual paths.
Now, you will unite the four individual paths into one.
Choose Path &gt; Union.
The four bounding boxes disappear and are replaced by one large bounding box that encompasses the entire coil motif.
Inkscape now “sees” the coil as one single path.
Inkscape’s <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function can work with this.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope24.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Creating a union out of the four individual paths.
Now is a good time to give the coil motif a border.
We chose a dark blue stroke color.
It will demarcate the top and bottom parts of the coil and serve as a stylized shadowing effect between adjacent coils once the rope has been made.
Choose Object &gt; Fill and Stroke…, <b>Stroke paint</b> tab, and type <b>000066ff</b> into the <b>RGBA</b> text box.
Press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the stroke color.
Select the <b>Stroke style</b> tab and give the border a <b>Width</b> of <b>0.150 px</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope25.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Dark blue stroke color and stroke width of 0.150 pixels.
Next, resize the coil motif so that it does not interfere with duplicates located on the path representing the opposite length of rope.
If the motif is too large, tops of one side will overlap the bottoms of the other side, producing an unrealistic and unsightly effect.
A good technique is to resize the motif using the spacing between adjacent path curves so that it just fits inside.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), select the motif, click-drag it so that it sits over the rope path, and resize it using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag on a sizing handle (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag allows you to resize an object and maintain its aspect ratio so it is not distorted).
Resize it so that it just fits inside the space or is a little smaller.
Resizing the motif this way allows it to be duplicated along the rope path without interfering with the other motifs on the other side of the path.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope26.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Resizing the coil motif.
The coil motif and the rope path will be placed into a image stack to help the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function work properly.
The coil path should be <u>topmost</u> as the pattern to be placed ontop of the rope path <u>underneath</u>, which directs the coil duplicates in their merry march along the path.
With Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), select the rope path and then click on the <b>Lower selection to bottom</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/LowerSelection2Bottom.gif" alt="Lower selection to bottom icon" width="26">) to put the path on the bottom of the image stack.
Select the coil motif with Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) and then click on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RaiseSelection2Top.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">) to put the motif at the top of the image stack.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope27.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Putting the rope path and coil motif into an image stack.
The <b>Pattern along Path</b> function needs to know a few things about the motif: how wide the bounding box is, by how much do you need to shift a duplicate so it fits just right against an adjacent motif, and whether the motif is oriented horizontally or vertically.
The geometry of the motif is such that its central width is one third of the width of the bounding box.
That is how the motif was constructed.
You can find the width of the motif by using the <b>Measure</b> tool.
Click on the <b>Hidden tools</b> arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/RightPointingArrow.gif" alt="Hidden tools arrow" width="26">) at the bottom of the toolbox, and then select <b>Measure</b>.
With the <b>Measure tool</b> cursor ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MeasureToolCursor.gif" alt="Measure tool cursor" width="26">), click on one side of the motif along its center line (use a guideline if needed) and then click on the other side.
A very nice feature of the <b>Measure</b> tool is that it can measure the width or height of an object, as seen in the figure below.
The coil motif has a central width of 1.60 pixels.
This is fortuitous for this tutorial because the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function does not work with feature resolutions finer than a tenth of a pixel.
A width of 1.60 pixels can be reexpressed as 1.6 pixels — the <b>0</b> can be discarded — so this measurement is at the level of resolution that the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function can work with.
Remember this number of <b>1.6 pixels</b>.
<b>Note:</b> If your measurement has a number not zero in the last place, for example, <b>1.64 px</b>, then resize the motif and remeasure its width with the <b>Measure</b> tool until you see a width with a <b>0</b> in the last place.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/MakeRope28.gif" alt="" class="lazy">
Coil motif width of <b>1.60</b> pixels.
It is now time to put the coil motif on the rope path and make the double-length of rope.
Move the coil motif to a side of the rope path.
With the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14B/Tutorial14B/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), select the coil motif and &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the rope path to group-select it (the order of selection is not important).
Now, choose Extensions &gt; Generate from Path &gt; Pattern along Path….
In the <b>Pattern along Path</b> dialog box, set <b>Copies of the Pattern = Repeated, stretched</b>, <b>Deformation type = Snake</b>, <b>Space between copies = 0.0</b>, <b>Normal offset = 0.0</b>, <b>Tangential offset = 0.0</b>, and check the checkbox for <b>Duplicate the pattern before deformation</b>.
Check the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox to view the first set of duplicated coil motifs on the rope path.
There is space for two more sets of motifs.
<b>Note:</b> the spacing between individual motifs is determined by the width of the motif’s bounding box, which is three times the length of the motifs central width.

Creating the first set of coil motifs along the rope path.
Click on the <b>Apply</b> button to set the first set of motifs.
There is no visible change in the image, but the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox unchecks — the <b>Pattern along Path</b> function is ready for you to create the second set of motifs.
Type <b>1.6</b> into the <b>Tangential offset</b> text box.
Press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the value.
After a few seconds of calculating behind the scene, the second set of motifs appear.

Creating the second set of motifs.
The second set of motifs overlap the first set a little bit.
Let’s adjust the spacing by incrementing it by one tenth of a pixel, to <b>1.7</b> pixels.
The spacing automatically readjusts after a few seconds and yields a more pleasing and exacting result.
Adjacent coil motifs are in contact by just the right amount.
Click on the <b>Apply</b> button to set the second set of motifs.
The <b>Live preview</b> checkbox unchecks, and the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> function awaits the third and final set of motifs.

Fine-adjusting the spacing between the first and second sets of coil motifs.
There is one last space to fill in order to complete the rope.
If <b>1.7 px</b> produces exact spacing for the first two sets of motifs, then duplicating and placing the first set by <b>3.4</b> pixels (1.7 × 2 = 3.4) should place the third set of motifs just right.
Replace the <b>1.7</b> value in the <b>Tangential offset</b> with <b>3.4</b> and check the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox.
The fit is exact! Click on the <b>Apply</b> button to set the third set of coils.

Setting the third set of coil motifs.
Note the good fit between adjacent coil motifs.
Also, note how the motifs deform at the strongly curved ends of the rope path.
Another note involves the <b>Duplicate the pattern before deformation</b> option.
When this checkbox is checked, the original pattern (the first set of coil motifs) remains in place.
If the checkbox is unchecked, that original pattern disappears.
When the artwork is demagnified, many small-scale details in the rope fade from view — they might be too small to be rendered well, and so, might simply disappear from view.
Do not delete the coil motif! You will use it again shortly.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing the Second Rope with the <i>Pattern Along Path</i> Function</span></h2>
Half of the work has already been done for this section: the rope coil motif has already been made and is just the right size for the rope path you will create.

Partially finished artwork.
You have now finished the second part of this three-part tutorial.
You learned what’s involved with critically thinking through a complex shape, here, a rope with coils.
You deconstructed the rope into individual coils, and a coil into related shapes that share side curvatures and side lengths.
Then, you reconstructed a couple of rope shapes by retracing the theoretical steps you took earlier, from end to beginning, to draw a believable rope image, coils and all.
This kind of critical thinking opens up a whole new arena of understanding and drawing shapes, with pencil, pen, Inkscape, or another computer drawing program.
You don’t have to be a mathematician — you just need a basic understanding of how the symmetry of shapes can help you develop a graphic design version of X-ray vision and help you choose the tools that work best for you.
In Tutorial 14, Part C, you will learn how to simulate pencil and pen scribble strokes as if you actually had colored pencils and pens and were just quickly filling in colors, among a couple of other techniques.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
What is the purpose of the Calligraphy tool mass control? Does the <b>Pattern Along Paths</b> function accept objects, paths, or both to lay out a pattern along a path? What does two-fold symmetry mean? What are some examples of two-fold symmetry? What might happen if the <b>Tangential offset</b> is lower than the ideal value for a sequence of <b>Pattern Along Path</b> duplicates? What is the value of critical thinking in graphic design? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
The Pen tool mass control slows down the reaction of the Calligraphy tool to the rate of speed at which you draw.
The higher the mass value, the more slowly the pen stroke moves behind the Calligraphy tool cursor.
This simulates drawing with a heavy pen, although there is no real weight.
However, wiggles and jiggles caused from small hand movements are reduced, resulting in a smoother stroke.
The <b>Pattern Along Paths</b> function accepts <u>only</u> paths.
The pattern to be applied to a path has to be converted to a path, by choosing either Path &gt; Object to Path or Path &gt; Stroke to Path, depending upon the nature of the pattern.
The same thing goes for the path that the pattern follows.
Two-fold symmetry means that you can take an object, rotate it by 180 degrees about an axis of rotation, and you’ll see the exact same thing again.
Examples of two-fold symmetry include a rectangle, a diamond shape <b></b>, the letters <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b> (non-stylized), <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>.
There is an infinity of other examples.
If the <b>Tangential offset</b> value is too small, duplicated objects might overlap, possibly producing an unsightly effect.
Critical thinking is a structured way of looking at a complicated problem, say, an image, by breaking it down into smaller image chunks that are easier to understand and work with.
In graphic design, these small pieces of the problem can show you symmetry where it looked like none existed before.
These smaller parts of the problem can help you gain insight into how you can solve it as you find techniques, here, Inkscape techniques and tools that can work for you each step along the way toward a solution.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/FinishedPoster.gif" alt="Finished artwork" class="lazy">
Inkscape’s brush, filter, and paint capabilities allow you to transform ordinary strokes of a pencil or pen tool into large swathes and splashes of color with textures suggesting mechanical scribbles with a color pencil or a looser, more relaxed back and forth movement with a pen.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: Review how to move objects between layers.
Edit the shape of an object using the Eraser tool.
Stretch a shape along a path and edit the result using the Pattern Along Path live path effect feature.
Create a variety of scribble effects.
Combine a scribble effect with a mask.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Moving Objects Between Layers</span></h2>
You can give the poster imagery a touch of stylized depth by moving a couple of tufts of grass from in back of the rope tied around the tree to in front of the rope, suggesting that the rope is tied right against the tree trunk, behind the grass tufts.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Simulating a Paintbrush Stroke</span></h2>

Now comes the interesting part of this section.
Download art file <a href="2174691.svg"><b>2174691.svg</b></a>.
This file contains an image of an ink spot, say, like the ink spot in Robert Louis Stevenson’s book <u>Treasure Island</u>.
This image will provide the texture needed to simulate a paintbrush stroke.
This art file of an ink splotch can also be downloaded from <a href="https://svgsilh.com/image/2174691.html"><b>https://svgsilh.com/image/2174691.html</b></a> at <a href="https://svgsilh.com/"><b>SVG SILF</b></a>, where there are many other examples available for free download (you can enter <b>splat ink grunge</b> in the search bar for more ink spots).
The ink spot is a large image.
You will rescale it to a manageable size, rotate it, squash it almost totally flat, and then apply it to the cloud motif as a pattern using the <b>Pattern Along Path LPE</b> function (<b>L</b>ive <b>P</b>attern <b>E</b>ffect).
<b>Note:</b> this <b>Pattern Along Path LPE</b> function is different from the <b>Pattern Along Path LPE</b> function used to create the rope in the previous tutorial (Tutorial 14, Part B).
You access it by choosing Path &gt; Path Effects… and then selecting an effect from an effects GUI (<u>G</u>raphic <u>U</u>ser <u>I</u>nterface).
Once the path has been modified, you can still edit it using the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/SelectionToolIcon.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) and the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">).

Our starting inkspot.
The inkspot has a couple of trailing extensions on its right side that can contribute to making fine hair-line traces for the end of the cloud motif’s outline, as if a camel-hair paintbrush was being used.
We chose to rotate the inkspot by 180 degrees to make it a little easier to smoothen the opposite side to make a smooth bullet-shaped head.

Rotating the inkspot.
To start the smoothening process, select the <b>Eraser</b> tool in the hidden tools area found at the bottom of the toolbox (click on the right-pointing arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/RightPointingArrow.gif" alt="Right-pointing arrow" width="26">)).
Set the <b>Width</b> to <b>20</b>.
<b>20</b> is a good width with which to start.
Use the <b>Eraser</b> as you would a regular rubber eraser.
Press the left mouse button and move the mouse back and forth as if you were using a rubber eraser.
It traces a red active path that disappears in a second or two once the underlying colored pixels have been erased.

With the <b>Eraser</b>, erase all the small spots of ink that you find splattered around the main splotch.

Examine the right side of the ink splotch to assess how much you want to erase to create a smooth side.
This side will serve as the head of the paintbrush stroke that you will create shortly.
With smooth, even strokes of the <b>Eraser</b> tool, shave off the protuberances on the right side of the ink splotch.

You will now draw a rectangle using the border rectangle as a guide.
This rectangle will become the path for cloud motifs that will line the border.
Select the Rectangle tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/RectangleToolIcon.gif" alt="Rectangle tool icon" width="26">) and draw a rectangle that follows the rectangle guide.
It might have a color fill and, perhaps, a border with the same or a different color — that is not important.
<b>Note:</b> the rectangle in the figure below has been made transparent to help in visualization.

Nodes appear on the rectangle corners allowing you to adjust the roundness of the corners (the circle at the top right corner), and two squares for adjusting rectangle length and width.
The four nodes inside the rectangle allow you to change the number/density of the sine waves and how they are angled.

The two left-hand circles are reference points (or zero points, if you will) for their corresponding Scale/Direction node and Bend node.
You can move all four around to achieve different effects.
You will work with Scale/Direction node (upper left diamond).
The sine waves will remain straight, so you will not need the Bend node (lower right diamond).
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/HatchNodes.gif" alt="Hatch nodes" class="lazy">
Hatch nodes.
To achieve the look of grass, you need to move the Scale/Direction node in toward its corresponding reference circle.
Move it in slowly to see how its action affects the look of the sine waves.
Moving this node in toward its reference point causes more sine waves to be created, increasing the density of the waves in the lawn rectangle until they become indistinguishable from each other, creating the impression of lawn grass.
The Scale/Direction node is very sensitive to placement and you might find that Inkscape reacts relatively slowly to node movement.
The slowness arises from Inkscape performing some intense calculations behind the scenes to maintain the “sloppy” or quasi-random look of the sine waves as more waves are created and sized to fit properly within their rectangular confine.
If response time lengthens, then slow down in moving the Scale/Direction node further so Inkscape can catch up with you.
Do give yourself time to get used to how this feature works.
Because the Scale/Direction node also acts to give the sine waves an angle of inclination, keep the node even with its reference point.
Again, note how sensitive the results are to node placement.

The Scale/Direction node is to be moved next to its reference node.
To make fine adjustment easier, zoom in on the nodes.

At this magnification, or higher or lower, you can position the Scale/Direction node very close to its reference point and finely adjust it to be exactly level with the point, resulting in vertical sine wave spikes.

As you did with the lawn grass path effect, move the Scale/Direction node in toward its reference point to increase the density of sine waves in the water rectangle.
Note how the gradient is maintained as sine waves are added.
Also, note how slow Inkscape is in keeping up with the movement of the cursor — there is much computation taking place behind the scenes to maintain the scribble look.
Zoom in to the nodes — the magnification is 1200% in the figure below — to fine-adjust the density of sine waves and their angle of inclination.
The angle of the waves below is about 40 degrees from the horizontal.
You achieve this inclination by moving the Scale/Direction node in toward its reference point and positioning it below the reference point by about 50 degrees.
Note how sensitive the Scale/Direction node is to positioning.
The more you use this feature, the more your sense develops in using it with comparable sensitivity and intuition.

Now is a good point in time to rearrange layers into an order that makes sense.
In the last section, you have been in the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer.

In reality, a lawn should lie underneath a tree and lake water should lie underneath a boat.
It only makes sense that the <b>Lake and Lawn</b> layer should be put underneath those other layers.
It can lie above the <b>Guides</b> layer.

There are two techniques involved in working with scribbled text.
They both use the <b>Hatches</b> path effect.
Letters that are open to the outside are treated one way.
Letters that contain enclosed spaces need to be treated differently to retain those open areas.
Type LAKESIDE DESIGNS using a sans-serif font.
We used Myriad Pro, bold, 72 points, 72 point leading (space between lines), and centered alignment.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/Lakeside1.gif" alt="Starting text" class="lazy">
Starting text.
The text contains letters that are entirely open to the outside and letters that contain enclosed spaces.
Because we need to treat the two types of letters differently, we need to separate them as groups.
There are only three closed letters to separate from the pack: one A and two Ds.
Convert the text, which is a single object, into a single path by choosing Path &gt; Object to Path.
Break the text into individual letter paths by clicking on the <b>Ungroup selected groups</b> icon in the <b>Tool Controls Bar</b>.

The main body of the text has been transformed into letters made up of coherent, horizontal scribbles.
All of these letters are open to the outside and do not contain any enclosed spaces.
The remaining three letters do contain spaces that have no access to the outside, and so will be treated differently.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
How do you move an object from one layer to another? What Inkscape feature do you use in order to obtain a scribble effect with pen and pencil strokes? If you get a figure that makes no sense to you when you apply the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> path effect, what can you do to troubleshoot the problem? What tool allows you to change the density of scribble lines and their angle of orientation when you have drawn them? What are examples of letters that have enclosed spaces, requiring a mask to make those spaces transparent? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
You can move an object from one layer to another by first selecting it.
Then, if it is on a layer lower in the layer stack than the destination layer, then press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgUp&gt; until the destination layer is highlighted in the <b>Layers</b> dialog box.
If the object to be moved is in a layer higher than the destination layer, press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgDn&gt; until the destination layer is highlighted in the <b>Layers</b> dialog box.
You use the <b>Hatches (rough)</b> path effect, found as an option in the Path &gt; Path Effects… <b>Live Path Effects Selector</b>.
If you apply the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> path effect on an object that is to be used as a pattern and a path, and obtain a strange result, you can select the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial14C/Tutorial14C/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">) to view the underlying structure of the path effect, click-drag the <b>Width</b> node toward its associated path node, and observe the changing figure until it conforms to what you envision it to be.
After you have drawn your scribbles, you can increase the number of up-and-down strokes by moving the <b>Scale/Direction</b> node <u>toward</u> its corresponding reference point (open circle), or decrease the number of strokes by moving the <b>Scale/Direction</b> node <u>away</u> from its reference point.
You change the angle of orientation by moving the <b>Scale/Direction</b> node <u>around</u> its reference point until the inclination of the strokes is just how you want it.
Examples of Latin-based letters include: Capital letters: A, B, D, O, P, Q, R Lower-case letters: a, b, d, e, g, o, p, q These letters require masks to eliminate the internal white space that is left as an artifact of the <b>Hatches</b> path effect process.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial15A/images/FinishedArtwork.gif" alt="Finished artwork" class="lazy">
Inkscape’s drawing and painting tools allow you to create the effect of depth with drop shadow and color gradient capabilities.
Cylindrical containers, spheres, and vases become solid when they cast a shadow on a background or reflect a source of illumination, enhancing the effect of a three-dimensional environment.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: Bend text.
Style text outlines.
Create a 3-D cylinder out a rectangle and ellipses.
Add gradient coloring to create illumination on a curved surface.
Use a Pattern Along Path technique to create and place a decorative band around the middle of a cylinder.
This tutorial is the first of two parts in which you will create a series of 3-D objects for a poster.
Each object is made using separate sets of drawing techniques to create the illusion of depth.

File &gt;Save the artwork.
<b>Note:</b> Inkscape has an idiosyncracy that involves the order in which a drop shadow and path bend are applied.
In the artwork above, the drop shadow filter was applied before applying the path bend effect.
The result below shows an even casting of the drop shadow.
If, however, the path bend effect is applied <u>before</u> the drop shadow, a portion of the drop shadow is clipped off, producing a visually unpleasant result.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial15A/images/ShadowClipping.gif" alt="Applying the drop shadow filter &lt;u&gt;before&lt;/u&gt; the bend path effect and &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt; the bend path effect" class="lazy">
Applying the drop shadow filter <u>before</u> the bend path effect and <u>after</u> the bend path effect.
Note the clipped shadows in the second example.
If you want or need to combine drop shadow and bend path effects, consider using the <b>Bend</b> path effect last.
The <b>Bend</b> path effect works on whatever paths you select, including their attributes, such a drop shadow.
A drop shadow filter extends out from what is easily visible, and yet is still part of the shadow region.
The <b>Bend</b> tool “sees” that invisible region, considers it as part of the shadow, and thus includes it as part of the whole construct that is to be warped.
If, however, the object is bent <u>before</u> applying the drop shadow filter, the <b>Bend</b> tool “sees” only the object to be warped, but there is no shadow to include as part of the object.
The object is warped, and then, when the drop shadow filter is applied, the boundary created by the <b>Bend</b> tool inadvertently clips the shadow up to the limit set by the bounding box of the original object.
Should something look not right, consider changing the order with which filters and effects are applied as you create your artwork.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing a Cylinder</span></h2>
In this section, you will draw the cylindrical body of the soap canister.
You will start by grouping all the components that make up the lid design to make it easy to manipulate the entire object.
You will then rotate the canister lid design by 15 degrees anticlockwise to suggest that you are viewing it from a casual, off-angle perspective.

You will now draw the bottom rim of the canister.
Below the rectangle you just drew, draw a circle, using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag, that fits inside the two guidelines.
If you don’t get the diameter right, switch to the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial15A/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">) and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag a sizing handle until you get a circle that fits exactly between the two guidelines.
Guideline indicator messages will let you know when the circle touches a guideline.
With the circle still selected, give it a <b>50% Gray</b> color fill and a stroke of <b>none</b> as you had done for the rectangle in Step 4.
You will now transform the circle into an ellipse having the same curvature as the canister lid.

You will now add the green leaf vein to the caravan of marching leaves.
The <b>Pattern Along Path</b> path effect works <u>only</u> with one ungrouped object that is the pattern and <u>only</u> one path that guides the pattern succession.
In order to construct a pattern that is made of more than one object, such as the leaf motif in this exercise, each object needs to be applied to a duplicate of the original path and then moved ontop or below the base pattern.
<b>Note:</b> It is important that all components that make up a composite pattern along a path like the leaf body and vein pattern have exactly the same length.
If lengths are different, one component will not line up with another as individually different lengths add up to create an increasing mismatch and misalignment as the pattern is traversed from one end to the other.
It is wise to make sure that 1) individual motifs have the same length and 2) that they are applied to paths having the exact same size (length) and curvature so the resulting patterns will fit together seamlessly.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
When creating a cylinder, what needs to be done about the angle of the top surface and the bottom surface? What are good tools to use to ensure that the top, bottom, and sides of of cylinder all have matching diameters and widths? How are gradients helpful in creating a 3-D effect? What is necessary to have a composite pattern along a path merge properly? What can you do if a portion of a pattern along a path extends beyond where you want it to stop? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
Both the top and bottom surfaces of a cylinder need to be shortened (transformed) by the same angle to produce a consistent shape.
Guidelines are good tools for constraining top and bottom circles or ellipses to have matching diameters or axes that also match the width of a cylinder body rectangle.
Gradients give the impression of light reflecting off a surface in ways that suggest that the surface has depth, is curved, or is at angle to the eye of the viewer.
Component parts of all motifs must have exactly the same length and each path for each motif must have exactly the same length and the same curvature.
You can clip the projecting part of the pattern by 1) drawing a rectangle or other shape that you can use as a graphical cookie cutter, 2) placing it over the part of the pattern to clip off, 3) making sure that the cookie cutter object lies above the object to clip in the image stack, 4) selecting both the cookie cutter object and the object to be clipped, and 5) choosing Object &gt; Clip &gt; Set Inverse (LPE).

Inkscape’s radial gradient tool helps you in highlighting the curvature of rounded objects, such as globes and vases, in ways that create the sense of a single directed light source.
The Swirl tool helps in creating a texture on a curved surface, further enhancing a 3-D effect.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to do the following: Unevenly swirl a two-dimensional texture.
Clip a background texture to create an illusion of a textured spherical surface.
Add a radial gradient to a background image to produce a curved reflection of a distant light source.
This tutorial is the second of two parts in which you create 3-D objects for a poster.
You have already created a short cylindrical canister with a lid, linear gradient on the side, and a decorative band that follows the middle line of the cylindrical body.
In this part, you will draw lemon soap globes that will have surface texturing and radial gradients that suggest a diffuse reflection of light from a nearby source of illumination.
You will also draw a vase that is made up of separate objects, merge them into one object, and then add gradients to the result to produce lighting, shadowing, and three-dimensional solidity.

Switch to the <b>Lemon.svg</b> Inkscape window, place the cursor to a side of the canister artwork and press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V to paste the lemon skin image at that location.
You will create a swirl effect with the lemon skin image.
The swirling motion will contribute to the three-dimensionality of the soap globes, enhanced further by applying a radial gradient.

Set the ellipse’s stroke to black, stroke thickness to 1 pixel, and fill color to <b>none</b>.
With a thin black stroke and no color fill, you can easily position the ellipse clipping mask where you need it with precision.
Place the ellipse on the swirl so that the center of the swirl occupies the top right portion of the ellipse.

Finalizing the radial gradient overlay.
If you separate the soap globe and the lighting-shadow overlay, you can see how the upper right region of the overlay can give the impression that a light is shining upon it from an angle, while underneath, the shadow suggests that the object is solid and opaque, not permitting light to reach the bottom.
For round objects, this technique is effective at producing the illusion of a three-dimensional round object.
A simple real-world example is to take an egg, put it on a table, and see how light interacts with it.
Look at it from different angles, place the egg at different distances from any source of illumination, and see how the interplay of light and shadow change in complementary ways to maintain the sense of three-dimensionality.
It is your job to learn how to replicate what you observe and use it in your own sense of design.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Using the Path Union Function and Radial Gradients to Create a Vase</span></h2>
Vases are objects of revolution.
The concept comes from geometry where you take a line or curve and rotate it around an axis of rotation.
Cylinders, spheres, bowls, cones, and vases are example of lines or curves and rotated around an axis.
You have already learned how to make a cylinder and globes, and give them a three-dimensional appearance.
The vase in this tutorial is a composite shape, made of a circle that is flattened at one end, a neck made of two joined curves, and an open top created from an ellipse.
Although the vase is simple in geometry, you will give it the close attention that a skilled ceramicist would give in creating in piece of fine porcelain by hand.
Select the <b>Ellipse</b> tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial15B/Tutorial15B/images/EllipseToolIcon.gif" alt="Ellipse tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox.
Draw a circle using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag.
Give it a thin black stroke and no (<b>none</b>) color fill.

Drawing a circle with a thin black stoke and no color fill.
You will flatten the bottom of the circle to impart the look that it is the bottom of the vase that sits on a flat surface.
Start by choosing Path &gt; Object to Path.
You will have great freedom to deforming one small part of the circle while leaving the rest of the circumference unaffected.
Four nodes appear on the four quadrants of the circle.

The soap canister that you created in Tutorial 15A has its lid rescaled using the <b>Transform</b> tool so that its height is now 30 percent of its original height of 100 percent.
The 30 percent value sets the amount of deformation throughout the artwork is a way that also sets the virtual angle at which a viewer looks at your artwork.
By maintaining a consistent value of 30 percent in any graphic design function that manipulates height reduction, you are able to maintain the consistent illusion of a real-world point of view from an angle, upwards or downwards, of your artwork, not from straight down or straight from a side.
You train the viewer’s eye and mind that they are looking at something simulating a real-world three-dimensional universe.
Transform the newly-drawn, and selected, circle by choosing Object &gt; Transform… Scale, and set its <b>Height</b> to <b>30</b> percent.
Make sure that <b>%</b> is selected as the unit of measurement.
Click on the <b>Apply</b> button and then on the <b>Close</b> button to dismiss the <b>Transform</b> dialog box.

You will now draw the vase’s neck.
“Grab” a vertical guideline from the left-hand ruler and drag it so that it just touches the left edge of the ellipse.
The small circle is that line’s <u>anchor</u> about which you can rotate the guideline.
Click-drag the anchor so it is situated where the guideline touches the ellipse.
It will be the point about which you will rotate the guideline so it just touches both the ellipse and the body of the vase.
This guideline will be used to constrain the curve that will become the left side of the neck.
You will not need to drag a second line to the right side of the ellipse, as you will see shortly.

Drag the square node to the upper right portion of the vase.
The yellow Will-o’-the-wisp follows it.
The yellow area will represent the area of greatest illumination from a nearby light source.
Click-drag one of the circular end nodes around about half a turn.
With that one end node still active (blue-colored), click on the <b>HSL</b> tab (<b>H</b>ue, <b>S</b>aturation, <b>L</b>ightness) in the <b>Fill</b> dialog box, and move the slider in the <b>L</b> color bar to the left until the lightness value equals <b>30</b>.
By reducing the lightness value, you are giving the outside region of the gradient a dark yellow color.
This darker color will represent shadowing on the back and bottom side of the vase.
Adjust the position of the square node and the two circular end nodes to achieve the kind of shadowing that you would like to see.
Note that, because the neck and body of the vase are now one object, courtesy of having performed the path union, the gradient affects the entire vase, instead of affecting just the neck or just the body.
You are producing the effect of depth of one solid three-dimensional body.

Zooming in on the ellipse.
When the top of a vase or cup is illuminated from the side and up a little bit, the light falls on one of the inside walls as a crescent arc.
The rest of the inside wall down from the illuminated arc is dark, so you know that you are looking deeper into the vase than the light can reach.
You will now imitate that light-and-shadow effect using a radial gradient.
As you can see in the figure below, the curve that marks the boundary between bright yellow and dark yellow looks like it is part of an ellipse.
You will use that insight to advantage by creating a radial gradient, part of which will color the inside of the ellipse and look solid.
The rest of the gradient outside the ellipse will be hidden.

Drag the square node down to the lower left-hand portion of the ellipse.

Click on a circular end node and rotate the radial gradient tool around until one line segment points to the left and down a little bit, and the other line points down and a little to the left.
The left-hand line will represent the dark yellow portion just down from the yellow illuminated portion of the inside of the neck and help you define its extent to the left as you refine the structure of the inside shadow.
The downward line represents that part of the inside shadow that grows darker as you go further down into the vase interior.

The edge rim now looks razor sharp.
This is supposed to be a vase, not a safety hazard! You will now give the lip thickness, including a gradient.
A thick rim also lends the look of solidness, which is what you want in a ceramic 3-D object.
With the ellipse still selected (reselect if it has been deselected), bring up the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> dialog box if it has been deselected or iconified, choose the <b>Stroke style</b> tab, and set the stroke <b>Width</b> to <b>8.000</b> pixels.
The edge broadens into a thick rim with a (radial) gradient already applied and its own <b>Radial gradient</b> tool active for immediate use.
The radial gradient was applied automatically because the color fill had just been given a radial gradient.

You have now completed the Inkscape tutorial that focuses on creating the appearance of three-dimensionality in your artwork.
Gradients can be an essential feature in simulating depth, distance, and the sense that some objects sit before, after, or next to others.
Experiment with different lighting and shadowing colors, different degrees of contrast, and consider adding other sources of illumination placed in different directions.
Base your experiments on what you see in reality, and then let your imagination take over.
Let Inkscape be your playground of the imagination! 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
How can you determine whether a linear gradient or radial gradient is better for creating creating lighting and shadowing on an object? How can you make a rim of a bowl, cup, or vase look solid and three-dimensional? When an object is made up of several parts that touch, what can you do to create smooth lighting and shadowing across the entire object? What can you do if parts do not touch? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
A basic rule-of-thumb is to take a real-world object similar to what you want to paint and place it under the type of illumination you intend to duplicate.
Critically observe how light is distributed across the surface or surfaces, and where and how shadowing appears.
Then, make your determination.
To give the appearance of solidity to a rim of anything having a top or opening, select the object that defines the rim and increase the width of the stroke using the <b>Width</b> feature in the <b>Stroke style</b> dialog box.
Adding a linear or radial gradient to the stroke via the <b>Stroke paint</b> dialog box allows you to be creative with the lighting of the rim to enhance the 3-D effect.
If the object you want to paint consists of parts that can be joined smoothly, like a vase, cup, or bowl, join them by first group-selecting them and then by choosing Path &gt; Union to unite them into one path.
Inkscape’s gradient functions will see that path as one entity that they can fill as you see fit.
If parts do not touch, then treat each separate part individually by giving them their own gradients.
If they are illuminated by the same light source, make sure that the direction of illumination and shadowing are similar on all the objects to maintain consistency in the play of light.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 16, Part A – Drawing Hair Using Live Path Effects</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16A/Tutorial16A/images/FinishedArtwork.gif" alt="Finished artwork" class="lazy">
Inkscape’s Live Path Effects offer the graphic designer a way to draw hair, fur, and other objects that need to appear as a series of wavy curves.
By combining sub-path stitching, envelope deformation, lattice deformation, and sub-path interpolation, the artist can draw areas where the filament look of hair, fur, and textiles adds texture, depth, and attractive detail to the composition of a piece of artwork.
This tutorial comes in two parts.
In this part, Tutorial 16, Part A, we will focus on the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect to draw hair.
We will use the <b>Envelope Deformation</b> and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> Live Path Effects to refine the overall shapes of areas of hair and create the smooth flow of hair that is trained into a ponytail.
Tutorial 16, Part B, will introduce <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> for more flow effects.
You’ll learn how to do the following techniques: draw curves that connect two boundary curves.
refine the shape of a multi-curve object using envelope deformation and lattice deformation tools.
Use transparency and color blending to create a sense of hair depth.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to draw hair.
You will be working with three <b>Live Path Effects</b>.
<b>Stitching Sub-paths</b> is a live-path function with which you draw a starting line or curve, and an ending line or curve.
These two boundaries are called <i>sub-paths</i> and help you define where a group of cross-lines start and where they end — you are graphically “stitching” the two sub-paths together.
A second and related live-path function is the sub-path interpolation live path effect.
Instead of stitching two sub-paths together, you draw two lines or curves that make the sides of an area that you will fill with parallel or sub-parallel curves that change in shape from one sub-path on one side to the other path on the other side of the space to be filled.
We will cover sub-path interpolation in the second part of this tutorial.
For more information about <b>Live Path Effects</b>, go to Help &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; 8.
Live Path Effects (LPEs), and click on <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> or <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>.

The task of this tutorial is to create overlays that you will place ontop of the areas of hair to create the look of strands of trained hair that follow the curvature of each area.
The coloration of underlying areas and overlying hair filaments will be different to give the appearance of darker hair underneath that is not reached by the light, and lighter-colored, variegated hair that is reflecting light.
The combination colors and styles of coloration produce subtle depth.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing Hair Using the <i>Stitch Sub-Paths</i> Live Path Effect</span></h2>
The <b><i>Stitch Sub-Paths</i> Live Path Effect</b> is a great tool for “stringing together ” a starting and an ending boundary path, here called <i>sub-paths</i>.
This section shows you how to analyze the underlying geometry that can guide you in determining how hair should flow and then in drawing it.
Select the top area of hair with the Select tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16A/Tutorial16A/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">).

The hair in this top area ideally appear as if it is coming from over the top edge and down into the lower, narrower part of the area that is constricted before it enters the ponytail.
The figure below provides an idea template of how hair filaments might flow from top to bottom.
You will create a “current” of hair that flows from over the top of the area into the narrow lower portion at the bottom using the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect.

Using the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16A/Tutorial16A/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen Tool icon" width="26">), draw two paths (sub-paths), one that follows the top curvature of the hair area and ends at a point just above the length of “straight” curve above the bottom, and the other following the curve that defines the bottom of the area.
<b>Note:</b> In order for <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> to work properly in this particular task, both sub-paths need to be draw in the same direction: either right-to-left as shown below, or left-to-right.
If the sub-paths are drawn but in opposing directions, <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> will make the hair paths criss-cross, which is what we don’t want.

The shadowy wavy patterns in the hair are calle Moiré patterns.
They are frequently visible in folds of cloth, or strands of hair that overlay each other, creating eye-catching, and yet attractive, interference patterns, such as waves and rays that radiate in or out in unpredictable directions.
The right side of the hair needs to be reshaped to match with the right side of the underlying area.
Hair does not usually flow in a purely linear way – it usually has a degree of curvature in its flow.
You will create a curved flow pattern using the <b>Envelope Deformation</b> Live Path Effect.

Inkscape allows you to randomly change the spacing between adjacent stitch lines.
You will apply this function to create uneven spacing between lines.

<b>Note:</b> each time you click a <b>Random number generator</b> icon, Inkscape creates a new sequence of random numbers that you can use in turn in creating unevenness in how far stitch paths are positioned from each other.
This feature is particularly useful in producing the trained, and yet subtley uneven spacing between hair strands in this project.
Larger values for a random number generator produce larger variations in random values.
They can result in larger spacings between adjacent lines.
A value of <b>0</b> creates regular spacing, that is, the <b>Random number generator</b> is turned off.
Experiment with different values for a random number generator and see what you get.
The more you use it, the more you develop your intuition for how to use it.

You have learned how to draw and texture hair using the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> Live Path Effects.
Color blending and transparency refine your sense of how to create three-dimensionality using color to give subtle, and yet believable depth to your artwork.
You will finish the artwork of this tutorial in Tutorial 16, Part B, where you will be introduced to the <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect which can make filling certain shapes with lines easier than with <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
How are <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> related as workflow tools as you create hair? How are <b>Envelope Deformation</b> and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> different from each other? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
The <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> tools are related in your workflow in that you first draw the hair using <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>.
To make the hair strands curved, you need to modify their original straight lengths using either <b>Envelope Deformation</b> or <b>Lattice Deformation</b>.
<b>Envelope Deformation</b> can be used for simple shapes and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> should be used for shapes having complex geometries.
<b>Envelope Deformation</b> affects the overall shape of an object using sides of a bounding box envelope.
The top, left, right, and bottom sides are separable tools whereby you can change the shape of each side’s line segment and end nodes without affecting the other sides.
<b>Lattice Deformation</b> works via a lattice grid whereby you can change the curvature and location of points both on the edges and inside a shape, producing complex modifications that <b>Envelope Deformation</b> can’t do.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 16, Part B – Drawing Hair Using Live Path Effects</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/images/FinishedArtwork.gif" alt="Finished artwork" class="lazy">
Inkscape’s Live Path Effects offer the graphic designer a way to draw hair, fur, and other objects that need to appear as a series of wavy curves.
By combining sub-path stitching, envelope deformation, lattice deformation, and sub-path interpolation, the artist can draw areas where the filaments of hair and fur, and the threads of textiles add texture, depth, and attractive detail to the composition of a piece of artwork.
This tutorial is the second part of a two-part tutorial series.
In this part, Tutorial 16, Part B, we will focus on the <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect to draw hair.
We will also use the <b>Envelope Deformation</b> and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> Live Path Effects to refine the overall shapes of areas of hair and create the smooth flow of hair that is trained into a ponytail.
You’ll learn how to do the following techniques: draw curves that fill the space between two parallel or sub-parallel boundary curves.
refine the shape of a multi-curve object using envelope deformation and lattice deformation tools.
Use transparency and color blending to create a sense of hair depth.
In this tutorial, you will continue learning how to draw hair.
You will be working with three <b>Live Path Effects</b>.
<b>Interpolate Sub-paths</b> is a live-path function with which you draw two starting lines or curves, called <i>sub-paths</i> that define the sides of a space that you intend to fill with lines the run parallel to one side sub-path and, as they cross the intervening space, they morph in curvature until they mimic the sub-path on the other side of the fill space.
For more information about <b>Live Path Effects</b>, go to Help &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; 8.

The task of this tutorial is to create overlays that you will place ontop of the areas of hair to create the look of strands of trained hair that follow the curvature of each area.
The coloration of underlying areas and overlying hair filaments will be different to give the appearance of darker hair underneath that is not reached by the light, and lighter-colored, variegated hair that is reflecting light.
The combination colors and styles of coloration produce subtle depth.

If you have been taking a break away from Inkscape for a while, it might be worthwhile to refresh your memory on the Live Path Effects that you have learned in the previous half of this tutorial (Tutorial 16, Part A).
In this section, you will draw the hair that runs down the back of the model’s neck in a triangular shape using the <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect.
In subsequent sections, we will focus on learning and using the <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Drawing the Right Side-Bang and Back Bang Using the <i>Sub-Path Interpolation</i> Live Path Effect</span></h2>
Drawing using the <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect is similar to drawing with the <b>Stitching Sub-Path</b> function.
The steps you take to draw are exactly the same as those for stitching sub-paths.
The two differences are that lines are drawn parallel or sub-parallel to the two edge sub-paths and that there is no randomizing option to introduce unevenness in line spacing and length.
In this section, you will draw the right side-bang and back bang (my terminology) for the model using <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b>.
Preparing the two sub-paths for the <b>Sub-Path Interpolation</b> Live Path Effect is done in exactly the same way as for <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>.
With the Pen tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/images/PenToolIcon.gif" alt="Pen tool icon" width="26">), draw two sub-paths (here, yellow is a great color to use because of its contrast to the background coloration) that will be the top and bottom limits of the space that the hairs will occupy.
They don’t need to be exact; they just need to provide a starting point for the eventual geometry of the sidebang.
Note that the upper sub-path is drawn so that it lies ontop of the hair object you drew in Tutorial 16, Part A.
The reason for this placement is that the sidebang will look like it comes out from underneath the larger hair object when you are finished.
Right now, you just need to see the starting layout.
The lines here are 4 pixels wide so you can see them easily.
They will remain as boundary lines when you apply <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>.

Rough drawing of the top and bottom limits of the sidebang shape.
You will create a bend in the left side of the lower sub-path to simulate hair that is pulled back behind the top of the ear.
Make the Node tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt="Node tool icon" width="26">) active and double-click on the bottom of the lower sub-path to add a new node there.

Click on the left end-node of the lower sub-path to activate it.

Adjust the directional handles of the node that you just added to micro-adjust the curvature if you desire.

The sidebang needs to be positioned underneath the larger body of hair it is partially situated upon and behind the ear.
Click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon in the <b>Tool Controls Bar</b> to lower the sidebang so that it lies underneath the upper larger body of hair and underneath the ear.
By arranging the sidebang in this stacking order of the image stack, you have given this area of the hair and face a three-dimensional feel.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/images/Sidebang11.gif" alt="Lowering the sidebang so that it lies underneath the upper body of hair and the ear" class="img-width">
Lowering the sidebang so that it lies underneath the upper body of hair and the ear.
The sidebang looks thin.
It is composed of evenly spaced lines.
The <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b> Live Path Effect does not have the randomizing capabilites that <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> has.
However, we can create an impression that the sidebang is more substantial than it currently looks.
We will create an underlying object that mimics the geometry of the sidebang and give it a gradient that suggests that there is more hair underneath and covered by the lines you drew that partially obscure details.
Select the Ellipse tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial16B/images/EllipseToolIcon.gif" alt="Ellipse tool icon" width="26">) in the toolbox and draw an ellipse that roughly mimics the size and shape of the sidebang.
The ellipse might have a reddish brown fill color because that was the last color you used in coloring the sidebang.
That color is the color you want for the sidebang so that it harmonizes with the rest of the hair.

The ellipse now has a radial gradient attached to it that changes from reddish brown to transparent at the edge.
You will see different gradient swatches in your <b>Radial gradient</b> library listing — what you see in the figure below is the result of my experiments.

The <b>Radial gradient</b> tool appears in the ellipse.
The square node controls the reddish brown center of the radial gradient and the two circular nodes control the transparency at the edge.

This is what we want.
Rotate one of the circular gradient nodes so that a longer directional handle (line) is aligned with the major axis (the long direction) of the ellipse.

Note that you will occasionally see spurious lines extending beyond the bounding box.
This lines result from minor discrepancies in how some lines are calculated and rendered by Inkscape.
They are easy to eliminate by redrawing bend paths and original sub-paths, by changing the number of stitching paths, and by changing the character of randomness of hair spacing and length (start and end edges).
The changes you make can be very small in order to eliminate those rendering errors.
You might also see spurious holes in the paths, which also result from calculation errors.
Again, just make minor changes as suggested above to make them disappear.

You have learned how to draw hair using Live Path Effects.
You now have a feel for how to use <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> to draw, to make major and minor adjustments to, and to add a natural look to human hair.
Hair, fur, cloth, and other materials that are made up of fibers, short and long, can be imitated with these drawing tools.
Live Path Effect tools are indeed sophisticated in their complexity, and yet this complexity allows you to draw things that are naturally complex in nature.
Gradient, tranparency, and color blending tools are great supplementary and complementary aids in creating a feeling of depth where, the deeper you go, the less light gets through to places underneath an illuminated and yet open surface.
Continue to explore these tools with different starting models, lighting, and shapes to create something that looks remarkably close to reality, either as we know it or as you would like to see it! 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
What is the primary distinction between <b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b>, <b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b>? What tools are available for you to add depth to hair, fur, or cloth? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
<b>Stitch Sub-Paths</b> and <b>Interpolate Sub-Paths</b> allow you to determine how to draw and then actually draw the strands of hair, fur, or threads of cloth that make up the foundation of that facet of your artwork.
<b>Envelope Deformation</b>, and <b>Lattice Deformation</b> allow you to shape and reshape the envelope that encompasses the body of hair, fur, or cloth so that the entire geometry of the shape conforms with your concept.

The <b>Linear gradient</b>, <b>Radial gradient</b>, <b>Transparency/Opacity</b>, and color <b>Blend mode</b> tools are available to help you give depth, shading, illumination, iridescence, and fine texturing produced by an external light source (internal light sources is not explored in this particular tutorial).

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 17 — Combining Inkscape Graphics and Gimp or Photoshop Images</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/FinishedArtwork.gif" alt="Finished artwork" class="lazy">
You can easily add an image created in an image-editing program to an Inkscape file.
This is an effective method for seeing how a photograph looks incorporated with a line drawing or for trying out an Inkscape special effect on bitmap images.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: Differentiate between vector and bitmap graphics.
Import embedded Gimp and Photoshop® graphics in an Inkscape file.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Combining Artwork</span></h2>
You can combine Inkscape artwork with images from other graphics applications in a variety of ways for a wide range of creative results.
Sharing artwork between applications lets you combine continuous-tone paintings and photographs with line art.
Even though Inkscape lets you create certain types of raster images, Gimp and Photoshop excel at many image-editing tasks; once done, the images can then be placed in Inkscape.
To illustrate how you can combine bitmap images with vector art and work between applications, this tutorial steps you through the process of creating a composite image.
In this tutorial, you will add bitmap images created to a postcard created in Inkscape.
Then you’ll adjust the color in the photo, mask the photo, and sample color from the photo to use in the Inkscape artwork.
You’ll update a positioned image and then export your postcard to Gimp to complete the type treatment.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Vector Versus Bitmap Graphics</span></h2>
Inkscape creates vector graphics, also called draw graphics, which are made up of shapes based on mathematical expressions.
These graphics consist of clear, smooth lines that retain their crispness when scaled.
They are appropriate for illustrations, type, and graphics, such as logos that may be scaled to different sizes.
<i>Bitmap images</i>, also called raster images, are based on a grid of pixels and are created by image-editing applications such as Gimp and Adobe Photoshop.
In working with bitmap images, you edit groups of pixels rather than objects of shapes.
Because bitmap graphics can represent subtle gradations of shade and color, they are appropriate for continuous-tone images such as photographs or artwork created in painting programs.
A disadvantage of bitmap graphics is that they lose definition and appear jagged when scaled up.
You can see the ragged the edges are in the rasterized image below.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/ChessLogoRaster.gif" alt="Bitmap art logo example" class="lazy">
Logo rasterized as bitmap art.
In deciding whether to use Inkscape or a bitmap image program such as Gimp for creating and combining graphics, consider both the elements of the image and how the image will be used.
In general, use Inkscape if you need to create art or type with clean lines that will look good at any magnification.
In most cases, you will also want to use Inkscape for laying out a design, because Inkscape offers more flexibility in working with type and with reselecting, moving, and altering images.
You can create raster images in Inkscape but its pixel-editing tools are limited.
Use Gimp or Photoshop for images that need pixel-editing, color correcting, painting, and other special effects.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
Download art file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/Tutorial17_end.svg"><b>Tutorial17_end.svg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/Tutorial17_end.gif" alt="Tutorial 17 finished artwork" class="lazy">
Tutorial 17 finished artwork.
Start Inkscape.
Choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size, and leave it on-screen as you work.
(Move the artwork where you want it in the window.) If you don’t want to leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.
<b>Resource:</b> For an illustration of the finished artwork in this lesson, see the beginning of this page.
Now download the starting art file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/Tutorial17_start.svg"><b>Tutorial17_start.svg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location.
Now you’ll open the start file to begin the lesson.
Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial17_start.svg</b> file.
The file has been prepared with three layers: the Text layer, and two additional layers: Layer 1 and Checkerboard, on which you’ll place images.
Checkerboard also contains objects that you’ll make into a mask.

Choose File &gt; Save As… and name the file <b>Postcard.svg</b>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Importing an SVG (Scaled Vector Graphics) Image File</span></h2>
You’ll begin by placing an <i><b>SVG</b></i>  image file in the Inkscape document as an embedded file.
Imported files can be embedded or linked.
Embedded files are added to the Inkscape file, and the Inkscape file size increases to reflect the addition of the imported file.
Linked files remain as separate, external files, with a link to the imported file in the Inkscape file.
(The linked file must always accompany the Inkscape file, or the link will break and the imported file will not appear in the Inkscape artwork.) Remember that <b>SVG</b> stands for <b>S</b>caled <b>V</b>ector <b>G</b>raphics which means that drawings are mathematical expressions that a graphics program, such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator® can understand and render (that is, draw) precisely, no matter how large or small the artwork is.
Click on the <b>Layers</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/LayersIcon.gif" alt="Layers Icon" width="26">) in the <b>Tool Controls Bar</b> to make the <b>Layers</b> dialog box active.
Resize the dialog box to make all the layers visible if needed.
In the <b>Layers</b> dialog box, select the Checkerboard layer.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/SelectingCheckerboardLayer.gif" alt="Selecting the Checkboard layer" class="lazy">
Selecting the Checkboard layer.
When you import an image, it is added to the selected layer.
You’ll use the Checkerboard layer for the imported image, because the layer includes artwork for a mask for the image that you’ll create later in the tutorial.
Download art file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/Chess.svg"><b>Chess.svg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location.
Now choose File &gt; Import… When the <b>Select file to import</b> dialog box appears, navigate to the <b>Chess.svg</b> file, select it, and click on the <b>Open</b> button.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/SelectFileToImportDialogBox.gif" alt="Select file to import dialog box" class="lazy">
<b>Select file to import</b> dialog box.
The <b>SVG input</b> dialog box appears.
Leave <b>DPI for rendered SVG</b> and <b>Image Rendering Mode</b> at their default settings.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/SVGInputDialogBox.gif" alt="SVG input dialog box" class="lazy">
<b>SVG input</b> dialog box.
Click the <b>OK</b> button.
The image is imported onto the Checkerboard layer.
In the figure below, it is placed at the upper left corner of the checkerboard.
You can see that, like the checkerboard, the imported image of the chess pieces lies underneath the text, which lies in the Text layer above.
It is as if you are working with tracing paper.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/BitmapFileImported.gif" alt="Bitmap image file imported and placed in the Checkerboard layer" class="lazy">
Bitmap image file imported and placed in the Checkerboard layer.
The image you just imported contains two grouped components: the background chessboard and chess pieces, and a masked image of the chess Queen piece, cut out and positioned exactly ontop of the image of the Queen in the background image.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/SVGInputFile.gif" alt="SVG input file" class="lazy">
SVG input file.
Now you’ll move the imported images, using <b>Snap</b> tools to place the image precisely.
Make the <b>Snap Controls Bar</b> active.
Choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Snap Controls Bar is it is not visible or has been iconified.
Click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt="Enable snapping icon" width="26">), <b>Snap bounding boxes</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/SnapBoundingBoxesIcon.gif" alt="Snap bounding boxes icon" width="26">), and <b>Snap bounding box corners</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/SnapBoundingBoxCornersIcon.gif" alt="Snap bounding box corners icon" width="26">) icons.
Click-drag the imported image until one of its corners coincides with its corresponding corner on the checkerboard image.
The snap function will alert you when the image corner is close enough to an underlying corner to be snapped precisely into place.
The square with dashed-line sides is an artifact of the positioning process.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/PositioningImportedImage.gif" alt="Positioning the imported image" class="lazy">
Positioning the imported image.
Now you will move the image below the checkerboard, and duplicate it.
<b>Importing Files</b> The <b>Import</b> command places files from other applications into Inkscape.
Files can be embedded, or included in, the Inkscape file, or they can be linked to the Inkscape file.
Linked files remain independent of the Inkscape file, resulting in a smaller Inkscape file.
Depending on a preference you set for updating links, the linked image in the Inkscape file may change when the artwork in the linked file changes.
By default, the <b>Embed</b> option is selected in the <b>bitmap image import</b> dialog box which opens after you have selected your image file to import.
If you deselect the <b>Link</b> option, the <b>Embed</b> option automatically activates and the artwork is embedded in the Inkscape file, resulting in a larger Inkscape file.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Duplicating an Imported Image</span></h2>
You can duplicate placed images just as you do other objects in an Inkscape file.
The copy of the image can then be modified independently of the original.
Now you’ll duplicate the Chess.svg image in the <b>Layers</b> palette and move it into its own layer.
Click on the <b>Unlocked Layer</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/UnlockedLayerIcon.gif" alt="Unlocked layer icon" width="26">) for the <b>Text</b> layer to toggle it locked ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/LockedLayerIcon.gif" alt="Locked layer icon" width="26">) so the text won’ be accidentally manipulated as you work.
Make the <b>Checkerboard</b> layer the active layer, if it isn’ already, and click on the background image.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Adjusting Color in a Bitmap Image</span></h2>
You can use filters to modify colors in bitmap images in a variety of ways.
You can use filters to convert to a different color mode (such as RGB, CMYK, or grayscale) or to adjust individual color values.
You can also use filters to saturate or desaturate (darken or lighten) colors, or invert colors (create a color negative).

In the <b>Layers</b> palette, select the <b>Background</b> layer.
Click the eye icon to all the layers <u>except</u> the <b>Background</b> layer to hide them.
When you hide a layer, all objects on that layer are deselected, hidden, and locked.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Masking an Image</span></h2>
Masks crop part of an image so that only a portion of the image appears through the shape of the mask.
You can make a mask from a single path or a compound path.

<h4>Creating Compound Path and Opacity Masks</h4>
In this section, you’ll create a compound path from the checkerboard pattern on the Checkerboard layer and create an opacity mask from the compound path, so that the Background layer appears through the mask.
Then you’ll adjust the colors in the Blue Chess layer to contrast with the Background layer.
Click on the eye icon of all the layers in the <b>Layer</b> palette except for the <b>Checkerboard</b> layer.

All black squares selected.
Choose Path &gt; Object to Path.
Right now you’ see no changes, but Inkscape no longer “sees” the squares as square objects but as a collection of paths and nodes.
Choose Path &gt; Combine.
The square paths have been merged into one compound path, which can be used as a mask.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial17/images/CombinePaths.gif" alt="Combining paths" class="lazy">
Combining paths.
Note that individual squares no longer have their own bounding boxes.
<b>Note:</b> the <b>Mask</b> function will work only when the mask is a single item, that is, a single object.
You make separate individual objects into one either by grouping them using the <b>Group selected objects</b> function or by converting the objects into paths and then using the <b>Combine</b> paths function.
Combined paths act just like grouped objects.
The only difference lies behind the scenes.
Inkscape still “sees” grouped objects as, indeed single objects that have been collected together to form a compound entity in which all of its components are still recognized as squares, circles, and other shapes that will still have their shape identity if that group is ungrouped — you will get all of your original shapes back again.
On the other hand, objects that have been converted into paths have lost all of their shape attributes and are “seen” only as collections of lines, curves, and nodes.
When combined into a single compound path, that entity is still a collection of lines, curves, and nodes.
Combined paths can be broken apart using the <b>Break apart</b> path function, but the result is still a collection of lines, curves, and nodes, but with no shape information.
Path effect functions work on paths.
Some of these functions first convert an object with shape information into a path because that is how they work.
They won’t work on objects containing shape information.
That is simply how those functions have been put together.
Yet, you can manipulate those converted objects in ways that you can’t with regular shape tools.
Click off the artwork to deselect it.
In the <b>Layers</b> palette, lock the <b>Text</b>, <b>Masked Queen</b>, and <b>Blue Chess</b> layers.

<h4>Editing a Masked Image</h4>
The contrast between the blue and yellow squares of the background is low.
The focus of the card is supposed to be on the Queen chess piece — the title of the card is, after all, “The Queen’s Gambit.” It makes sense to have the background more subdued in comparison with the coloration of the Queen and highlight the Queen so that she “pops” visually out of the picture.
In the <b>Layers</b> palette, unlock both the <b>Background</b> and <b>Blue Chess</b> layers if they aren’t already unlocked.
Lock the <b>Text</b>, <b>Checkerboard</b>, and <b>Masked Queen</b> layers so they won’t be affected by the colorizing you will do next.
Choose Edit &gt; Select All in All Layers to select all objects in those layers that are unlocked.
Objects in locked or hidden layers will not be selected.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Exploring on Your Own</span></h2>
Now that you know how to import, mask, and apply color filters to an image in an Inkscape file, you can import other images and apply a variety of modifications to them.
You can also create masks for images from objects you create in Inkscape.
For more practice, try the following: Repeat the tutorial by making a copy of the Chess.svg file, call it <b>Chess2.svg</b>.
In addition to adjusting color in the component images, apply transformation effects, such as shearing or rotating, or filters or effects, such as one of the extension Distort filters/effects, to create stylistic contrast between the two images in the checkerboard pattern.
Use the basic shapes tools or the drawing tools to draw objects to create a compound path to use as a mask.
Then place the Chess.svg image into the file with the compound path, and apply the compound path as a mask.
Create large type and use the type as a mask to mask a placed object.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
Describe the difference between linking and embeding a placed file in Inkscape.
How do you create an opacity mask for an imported image? What kinds of objects can be used as masks? What color modifications can you apply to a selected object using filters? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
A linked file is a separate, external file connected to the Inkscape file by an electronic link.
A linked file does not add significantly to the size of the Inkscape file.
The linked file <u>must</u> accompany the Inkscape file to preserve the link and ensure that the imported file appears in the Inkscape file.
An embedded file is included in the Inkscape file.
The Inkscape file size reflects the addition of the embedded file.
Because the embedded file is part of the Inkscape file, there is no link to break.
You create an opacity mask by placing the object to be used as a mask on top of the object to be masked.
Then you select the mask and the objects to be masked, and choose Object &gt; Mask &gt; Set.
A mask can be a simple or compound path.
You can use type as a mask.
You can import opacity masks with from Gimp and Photoshop.
You can also create layer clipping masks with any shape that is the topmost object of a group or layer.
You can use filters to change the color mode (RGB, CMYK, HSL, HSV, or Grayscale) or adjust individual colors in a selected object.
You can also saturate or desaturate colors or invert colors in a selected object.
You can apply color modifications to placed images, as well as to artwork created in Inkscape.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 18 — Using Patterns to Create an Engraving Effect</span></h2>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/FinalArtwork.png" alt="Finished artwork" class="lazy">
Inkscape’s Patterns feature allows you to fill an empty space with different geometric shapes, such as straight, curved, and zig-zag lines.
With line patterns, you can make your artwork look like a piece of intaglio printing or engraving.
You can combine line patterns with background images, incorporate gradients and blurs, and mask imported bitmap images that produces a composite picture of multi-dimensional breadth and depth to capture the viewer’s attention.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: Create line grids using the Patterns feature to simulate engraving.
Blur edges of bitmap images using masking to produce vignettes.
Embed bitmap images into a host Inkscape file.
Create a background cloud image using a gradient and blurred brush strokes.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Combining Artwork</span></h2>
In the previous tutorial (Tutorial 17), you combined Inkscape artwork with images from other graphics, producing a mult-faceted composite image for a poster.
In this tutorial, you’ll continue combining continuous-tone photographs with vector-based line art.
You will open an Inkscape file that contains a bitmap image of a mountain (Mt. Hood in the state of Oregon, USA) with a map overlay that defines areas of lightness and darkness.
You will separate and fill each individual area with a different line pattern to simulate horizontal line engraving of light and dark areas.
In another Inkscape file, you will import bitmap images of rare Oregon orchid flowers brought in from the Internet and create vignettes out of them.
Finally, you will create a background image of a lightly clouded sky with a linear gradient and a few blurred brush strokes to imitate separate, distant individual clouds.
You will combine all of these images into one to create a composite poster image.

Areas of different shading have been delineated on the mountain that will contain different pattern fills.
The final effect is to produce an image simulating intaglio printing or engraving with horizontal lines.

<h4>Intaglio Printing</h4>
<i>Intaglio</i> is the family of printing and printmaking techniques where an image is acid-etched or mechanically cut into a surface, usually of metal, such as copper or zinc.
The lines, curves, and other cuts hold ink which is then transferred onto a page.
When a sharp cutting instrument, like a <i>burin</i> (a strong steel needle meant for digging grooves and pits into a metal plate) is used to create the image prototype, this particular method of creating an image is called <i>engraving</i>.
An example of line engraving technique in action and a finished piece of artwork are shown on the right.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Separating Areas of Different Shading</span></h2>
At first glance, Mt. Hood is a mesh (and a mess) of overlapping pieces of slope.
Each piece will contain its own color of engraving.
You will group-select the central portion of the mountain that contains the map, make a duplicate of the map and move it down from the image.
You will then make a duplicate of that map and disassemble it into its various parts for individual treatment.
With the Select Tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection tool icon" width="26">), draw a rectangle around the mapped area to group-select all the map pieces.
Make sure all pieces are within the rectangle.
(For review on group-selecting, see Tutorial 2, Using the Select Tool.)

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating a Pattern Palette for the Engraving Effect</span></h2>
Engraving colors into a piece of artwork can be a delicate and tricky endeavor.
Engraving color fills are alternate colored and white lines and curves, resulting from the transfer of the ink in the line and curve grooves dug into the metal engraving plate interlayered with white lines from the raised areas between the grooves.
You see an average color when you stand back from the work, and alternating colored and white lines when you look more closely, as shown below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Nemo.png" alt="An engraving by Alphonse de Neuville from Jules Verne's 2000 Leagues Under the Sea" class="lazy">
An engraving by Alphonse de Neuville from Jules Verne's 2000 Leagues Under the Sea.
A technique that helps in keeping engraved fills equivalent in lightness (or darkness) to an original color involves making the starting color for the colored lines darker than the original.
Neighboring white lines can create an average brightness that mimics the original color to satisfaction.
It can take a certain amount of experimentation to get the color balance just right.
In this tutorial, you will be provided reasonable starting colors to create your engraving palette.
The figure below shows a palette of six colors to the right of the artwork.
The bottommost color will be used as a solid fill for the bottommost area of hill topography at the base of Mt. Hood.
All other colors will serve as the base color for an engraving grid.
Each rectangle of color has its corresponding hexadecimal code, or hex code, for short, above it.
The final <b>ff</b> on each code stands for its opacity, which is 100% in each instance.

Selecting palette colors.
Note how the colors become light as you go from bottom to top.
They are to represent areas of distance and shadow, in keeping with how mountains can appear lighter and bluer as they recede into the distance.
You will now create the engraving grid from the dark blue rectangle second from the bottom.
Select and duplicate the dark blue rectangle with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D, and move the duplicate off to the side.

Make a second duplicate rectangle and move it down to below the first duplicate.
Activate the Snap Tools toolbar if it isn’t active already, and click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt="Enable snapping icon" width="26">), <b>Snap bounding boxes</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/SnapBoundingBoxesIcon.gif" alt="Snap bounding boxes icon" width="26">), and <b>Snap bounding box corners</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/SnapBoundingBoxCornersIcon.gif" alt="Snap bounding box corners icon" width="26">) icons.

A circle and square handle move up along with the &amp;times.
The circular handle, which you won't use, governs the angle at which the lines (or any other pattern figure) are oriented.
You'll keep the lines horizontal.
The square handle, however, governs how thick or thin the grid lines are.
You can move the square up or down, and the two rectangles that make up the pattern template grow either thicker or thinner, depending upon which direction you move the square.
If there were vertical lines, moving the square left or right would change their thickness.
In this case, there are no vertical lines, so we don’t need to be concerned about them.

Hovering over the Pattern tool square.
Keeping the Node tool on the square handle (it should stay red so long as you hover over it), drag it up toward the Patter tool reference handle.
Two things happen as the square approaches the &amp;times.
First of all, the two rectangles become thinner and more appear in the space that originally contained two.
Also, the circular handle approaches the reference handle, moving along a horizontal line.
This is what you want in making your engraving grids.
Stop a short distance away from the reference point, and move the red square up toward the circle.
The grid lines continue to become thinner.
Stop when you feel a reasonable thinness has been reached.
By keeping the Pattern tool reference handle, square grid thickness handle, and the circular grid orientation handle is close proximity, you can keep close tabs (pun intentional) on what you doing with the tool.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating the Engraving Effect</span></h2>
You have now created an engraving palette.
Your next step is to put it to good use.
In this section, you will use Inkscape’s Clip tool to turn each area into an engraving.
Determine which shapes should have lighter or darker grids and organize them by shade category.
Below, shapes are categorized from lightest shading at the top row to the solid blue at the bottom.
Their associated engraving grid is on the right of each row.
The first shape in the second row from the top is a composite shape and will receive its own individual treatment.

Here, you will take all the pieces of Mt. Hood that you drew and fit them together much as you would a jigsaw puzzle.
The difference is that you will also determine where each piece is situated in the image stack.
Some pieces need to be partially situated underneath other pieces in the image stack to give the impression of depth or of one part of the mountain casting a shadow on another.
It will be as if you were working with a three-dimensional puzzle! A good first step is to take the largest piece of the mountain and make it the background upon which all the other pieces will lie.
Make the Snap Tool toolbar active and click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt="Enable snapping icon" width="26">), <b>Snap bounding boxes</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/SnapBoundingBoxesIcon.gif" alt="Snap bounding boxes icon" width="26">), and <b>Snap bounding box corners</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/SnapBoundingBoxCornersIcon.gif" alt="Snap bounding box corners icon" width="26">) icons.
Move or copy the piece that contains the summit (the biggest piece) and move it so that it fits exactly inside the black outline that has the same shape.
A tooltip box will inform you when positioning is exact.

Positioning the first and largest piece of the mountain puzzle on the figure.
You will now position the piece in a good place in the image stack.
With the puzzle piece still selected, click on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">) to put the piece at the top of the image stack.
Press the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) several times.
As you press the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon, the black border of a different puzzle piece will appear as the selected piece is put underneath it in the image stack.
When the puzzle piece disappears, you have put it underneath the original background picture.
You know where the piece is and now it’s time to raise it one step in the image stack.
Press the <b>Raise selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection one step icon" width="26">) to raise the puzzle piece to lie directly upon the background picture and underneath all the black borders for the other pieces.
This is how you can work with the third dimension of this three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle.

With the second piece still selected, bring it to the top of the image stack by pressing the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">), and then pressing the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) until it disappears underneath the first piece you have put in.
Press the <b>Raise selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection one step icon" width="26">) to bring the puzzle piece up one level so that it sits ontop of the first puzzle piece.
You should see the black borders for other pieces that will lie ontop of what you just inserted.
These other pieces, once included, will represent a hill, a cliff on the mountain, and their shadows, giving your artwork a sense of depth.
The piece you just moved is lighter compared to the underlying piece because it represents a portion of slope whose snow is reflecting more sunlight than the background.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw04.gif" alt="Positioning the second largest piece of the mountain puzzle in the image stack" class="lazy">
Positioning the second largest piece of the mountain puzzle in the image stack.
The next piece is a hill that stands in front and to our right of Mt. Hood.
Move this next, slightly darker puzzle piece into its place on the figure where you see its black outline.
The Snap function will let you know when it’s in position.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw05.gif" alt="Moving the hill piece into place on the mountainside" class="lazy">

With the hill piece still selected, bring it to the top of the image stack by pressing the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">), and then pressing the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) until it disappears underneath the second, very light piece you have put already in.
Then, press the <b>Raise selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection one step icon" width="26">) so that it sits ontop of the second puzzle piece.
Note that the bottom of the hill piece is just a straight line.
That part will be hidden by another, overlying piece that will represent closer hill country.

Hill piece now properly positioned in the image stack.
You will now give the hill you just inserted a shadow.
Move the next, even darker puzzle piece that looks like a triangle into place where you see its corresponding black outline.
The Snap function, of course, will let you know when it’s in position.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw07.gif" alt="Moving the hill shadow into place in the figure" class="lazy">
Moving the hill shadow into place in the figure.
With the hill piece still selected, bring it to the top of the image stack by pressing the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">), and then pressing the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) until it is partially covered by the hill piece.
You don’t have to lower it any further in the image stack because it just needs to be behind the hill, representing its shadow on the main mountain slope in back of it, and heightening the suggestion of three-dimensionality.
You will attend to the black border curves and lines later.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw08.gif" alt="Putting the hill shadow piece into place in the image stack so that it hints at really being a shadow" class="lazy">

Just as you did in Step 7, move the even darker puzzle piece of front hill country, seen in the figure below, into position in the black border having the same shape.
This piece of the puzzle represents even closer hill country with less snow and more forest, seen at a distance.
Make sure that this piece is at the top of the image stack by clicking on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">).
It represents the closest piece of landscape at this moment (but it won’t last for long).

Now move the solid dark blue shape into place.
It represents the closest piece of landscape in the figure.
Make sure that it is topmost in the image stack by clicking on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">).

Putting the solid dark blue puzzle piece into place.
The next piece you will insert represents the shadow cast into a valley cut by a glacier (Reid Glacer) from the ridge leading up to a rock point (Illumination Rock).
Move or copy the shape shown in the figure below and move it into its place designated by its outline, just as you have been doing previously.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw11.gif" alt="Inserting a shadow piece" class="lazy">

Because this shape is the shadow for the very light puzzle piece to its right, you light place it underneath that right-hand piece so that it is partially hidden by it.
Click on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">) and then click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) until you see the shadow partially underneath the ridge defined by the right-hand puzzle piece.
If you don’t see the shadow, then you might have lowered it too far and it is now underneath the main slope of the mountain.
Press the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">) until the shadow piece appears.
Don’t mind the straight line border.
You will take care of that shortly.

The shadow puzzle piece placed properly in the image stack.
The next piece (seen below) represents an area of rock that is not fully covered by snow, so it has a dark blue color (for distant rock).
Move it into place as you have been doing up to now.

This area of rock with some snow is the most forward part of Mt. Hood and yet behind the closest strip of landscape (the solid dark blue puzzle piece).
Put it at the top of the image stack by clicking on the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection to top icon" width="26">) and then click on the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt="Lower selection one step icon" width="26">) until the bottom of the shape disappears behind the solid dark blue of the forefront.

The dark puzzle piece placed just underneath the solid dark blue piece.
You will now insert another shadow cast by a ridge on the mountain.
Move and position the puzzle piece (shown below) as you’ve been doing over these past many steps so that it’s comfortably nestled inside the black border meant only for it.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw15.gif" alt="Inserting the next shadow piece" class="lazy">

Second shadow placed properly in the image stack.
Move a sub-shadow into position.
This piece of the puzzle represents a area of deep shadow, which should have a darker color than that of the underlying piece.
As you are about to position the shadow, note that there is a problem.
The piece of shadow that you are moving has exactly the same color as the underlying shadow.
This is a mistake.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Jigsaw17.gif" alt="A problem with shadows" class="lazy">
A problem with shadows.
Yes, we have a problem with shadow coloration.
However, it is very easy to fix.
The piece of shadow we just moved needs to be a little darker so that it will stand out from the background shadow.
Move the piece of shadow off the artwork, and copy and move another piece of shadow that is darker, to near the first piece.
The first piece is going to take on the darker engraving grid.
Note that both objects are clipped objects.
This is important to know for this kind of troubleshooting.

Then, press <b>Raise selection one step</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt="Raise selection one step icon" width="26">) so that it reappears above the background outrunner piece but behind the solid dark blue foreground piece of landscape.
This juxtaposition of puzzle pieces in the image stack allows you to project an illusion of depth at this side of the mountain.

You have now put in, arranged, and ordered all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of Mt. Hood, sentinel mountain in the state of Oregon.
As an aside, it is actually a dormant volcano, the highest peak in Oregon, and a great place to visit (speaking from experience).
It had its last major eruption in 1781 to 1782.
It had a few hiccups afterward, but otherwise, it has been quiet (thankfully so).

You have just finished Tutorial 18 and learned how to create the appearance of engraving, old-style pictures or vignettes, and how to complement the appearance of engraved images and engraving-style fonts.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Exploring Further</span></h2>
This tutorial shows you only one way of many of using patterns, creating an engraving effect, and creating the vignette look.
Experiment with creating engraving images where colored lines alternate with lines of other colors.
Engraving lines don’t have to be all horizontal.
They can be at any angle, curved, bent (using the Live Path Effect Bend function), and made into hatched images where lines and curves cross.
Find pictures on the Internet whose borders can be blurred a lot, as seen in many portraits from the 1800s and early 1900s, and give your imagination full reign.

<h2><span class="orange">Tutorial 19 — Using Inkscape in Animation</span></h2>
<video height="768" width="1080" controls><source src="videos/McBirneyVideoClip.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
</source></video> Science with a Sense of Humor Inkscape can create backgrounds over which figures can be animated.
Moreover, Inkscape can create those figures to be animated.
An external animation program can then help you determine how those figures are to be moved and placed over the background you have either created or are about to create.
When the components work to satisfaction, the animation file can then be rendered, that is, drawn into an animation video clip that can be embedded in an HTML file and displayed in a browser.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: Import a bitmap image.
Convert a bitmap image into an svg graphic image.
Import a svg image file into a separate animation program.
Animate a portion of an imported background.
Render the animation into a video clip.
Embed the animation video clip into an HTML file that can be uploaded to the World Wide Web.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Inkscape and Animation</span></h2>
At the time of writing this tutorial (18 August 2021), Inkscape does not have the capabilities of producing animation.
However, it can help you create the building blocks that go into animation.
These building blocks include backgrounds and figures for later animation.
Backgrounds and figures, though they are static images, can be imported into an animation program which can then create the type of motion you would see if you drew figures on consecutive pages in a writing pad, and then flipped the pages rapidly enough to simulate motion.
In this case, you don’t have to draw every single page.
The computer does much of the tedious work of drawing and flipping the pages for you.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
You will work with the background first.
Download image file <a href="https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/Background_original.jpg"><b>Background_original.jpg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location.

Dr.
Alex McBirney looks out at us from specimen C.
This image is reproduced from a book on <u>Igneous Petrology</u>, written by Alexander McBirney.
<u>Igneous Petrology</u> is an out-of-print university textbook about the chemistry and mineralogy of lavas that McBirney and colleagues obtained out in the field.
Circles A, B, C, and D are drawings of thin slices of different lava rocks, called thin sections, used here in studying what different lava rocks look like under a microscope.
McBirney hand-drew all of these images.
As an experiment, Dr.
McBirney also drew little cartoon caricatures of himself in several of the specimens.
He wanted to test whether serious scientific publishing companies were indeed stringently careful in reviewing the books they were about to publish.
Every little representation of the good professor made it through the review process unscathed, which makes one wonder about the power of close scrutiny of some book publishing companies.
One such leprechaun peers out at us from specimen C.
You will animate Dr.
McBirney.
He will puff a smoke ring out of his pipe and then wink at you.
The background image is a jpg, that is, it is a bitmap image.
You will convert it into a scaled vector graphic (.svg) file so that the animation program you’ll be working with shortly can accept it.
<b>Resource:</b> For an illustration of the finished animation in this lesson, see the beginning of this page.

The <i>enve</i> window with main components labeled.
The <b>enve</b> screen has many of the tools that Inkscape has.
They are organized differently, and yet their functions are basically the same.
Look at the <b>Object Mode Toolbar</b>.
The first eight icons on the left are similar to those found on Inkscape’s toolbox, as shown below.

<h4>Note:</h4>
<b>enve</b>’s capabilities will not be explored in detail – that topic is outside the scope of this tutorial and well deserves its own stand-alone tutorial.
Only those tools and techniques needed to draw the animation shown here will be touched upon.
The point of this tutorial and project is to show you how Inkscape can contribute to the creation of animated 2-D graphic art in an easy-to-learn and easy-to-understand way.
There are tutorials on how to use <b>enve</b> already on the Internet — most of them are video clips — and they can expand your imagination on what is <u>freely</u> available to you if you are interested in exploring this area of graphic arts further.
<b>enve</b> has only recently been developed and is still undergoing refinement and expansion of its capabilities.
As <b>enve</b> continues to grow, so will the number of tutorials available on how to use it; all of it free for you to download, learn, enjoy, and create.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Putting the Animation Together</span></h2>
You’ll start by importing the background upon which the animation will take place.
Choose File &gt; Import File…, navigate to where you have file <b>Background.svg</b> stored, select it, and click on the <b>Open</b> button to open it.
The background image appears after a few seconds.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/ImportSVG.gif" alt="Importing the original svg art file" class="lazy">
Importing the original svg art file.
The <b>Object Mode</b> tool should be active by default when you first start <b>enve</b>.
Hover the <b>Object Mode</b> tool cursor over a black area to activate the moving function.
A black border appears indicating that the image can be manipulated.
Click-drag the image to the center of the canvas.
So far, tools work just as they do in Inkscape.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/MoveImage2Center.png" alt="Moving the image to the center of the canvas" class="lazy">
Moving the image to the center of the canvas.
You will now scale the image so that it fills the canvas.
Here is where the scaling function differs from what Inkscape has.
With the <b>Object Mode</b> cursor active, click on a black area in the image so that a black border appears around the whole image.
The image is now manipulable.
Press <b>S</b> to turn on scaling.
A dashed line appears between the cursor and a circle with a cross inside it.
This circle is called the image’s <b>pivot point</b> ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/PivotPoint.gif" alt="Pivot Point" width="26">).
It acts as an origin from which an object can be resized, or about which an object can be rotated, hence pivot point.
Without pressing any key, just pull the cursor away from the pivot point.
The image expands.
If the image is off-center, then turn off the scaling function by clicking the mouse, repositioning the mouse, and then pressing <b>S</b> again to turn scaling back on.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/ScalingImage1.png" alt="Pressing S to scale the image" class="lazy">
Pressing S to scale the image.
Move the image and rescale it until it fills the canvas.
Play around with moving and rescaling the image so that you get a feel for how the two functions work.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/ScalingImage2.gif" alt="Pressing S to scale the image" class="lazy">
Pressing S to scale the image.
Save your work by choosing File &gt; Save As….
When the <b>Save File</b> dialog box appears, name your animation file <b>GeniusAtWork</b>) so that the HTML page that you will embed it in later will recognize it, navigate to where you want to store it, and click on the <b>Save</b> button.
<b>enve</b> automatically appends the extension <b>.ev</b> to the filename so that <b>enve</b> can recognize it as an <b>enve</b> file.
Now that you have a good idea of how to use both the moving and scaling functions, you will now use <b>enve</b>’s zoom function.
The zoom function is different from the scale function because it magnifies the whole canvas, not just a selected object.
<u>Do note that</u>, when you scale an object, you are resizing it for the animation you intend to create.
Zooming in on an object does not rescale it for the animation — it increases or decreases the magnification of whatever you are looking at, like a telescope or microscope, so that you can see details better that you need to see without resizing the image.
So, scaling actually resizes images and image components, and you will see that resizing in the animation.
Zooming should be used strictly for better viewing without changing the size of images for purposes of the animation.
You zoom in by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-<b>+</b> (Control key and plus sign) and zoom out pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-<b>-</b> (Control key and minus sign).
For quick zooming, press the Control key and roll the mouse wheel.
To return to the default magnification, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-<b>0</b> (Control key and zero).
Zoom in on Dr.
McBirney using a combination of the move function and the zoom function.
Don’t use the scaling function with <b>S</b> because you will resize the background image.
Zoom works as if you are looking more closely at what you’re working on.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/ScalingImage3.gif" alt="Pressing the Control key and rolling the mouse wheel to zoom in on McBirney" class="lazy">
Pressing the Control key and rolling the mouse wheel to zoom in on Dr.
McBirney.
You will now start drawing a smoke ring that will come out of Dr.
McBirney’s pipebowl.
Click on the <b>Circle Mode</b> icon ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/CircleModeIcon.gif" alt="Circle Mode icon" width="26">) in the toolbar and draw a circle near the pipebowl.
By default, it will have a black stroke and transparent color fill.

The circle you just drew is selected.
The word <b>Circle</b> appears in the <b>Selected Objects</b> panel on the left side of the <b>enve</b> canvas and is highlighted.
Click on the <b>Expand Item</b> arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/ExpandArrow.gif" alt="Expand Item arrow" width>) to show the components and attributes that can contribute to animating the circle.

You will now activate the Animation Recorder by clicking on the white discs in front of items that are to be animated.
By clicking on these discs, the Animation Recorder “remembers” which objects and object attributes are to be changed with time.
The Animation Recorder also allows you to change how animated items are to change according to your vision.
Click on the white disc on the <b>transform</b> item line.
It turns red, indicating that <b>transform</b> functions can be changed.
Click on the <b>Expand Item</b> arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/images/ExpandArrow.gif" alt="Expand Item arrow" width>) for the <b>outline</b> attribute.
Make the black circle thicker and color it medium gray.
Click on the <b>thickness</b> Animation Recorder disc (it turns red) and change the thickness to <b>3</b> in the number box.
In the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel, click on the <b>Stroke</b> tab and <b>Flat</b> tab (for <u>flat</u> color).
Both tabs highlight and the color palette appears.
Note that the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel resembles Inkscape’s <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel, so working with it should be easy.
Click on the <b>HSV</b> tab (<b>H</b>ue <b>S</b>aturation <b>V</b>alue).
Set <b>H = 0</b>, <b>S = 0</b>,  <b>V = .5</b>, and <b>A = 1</b>.
<b>V</b> acts like the lightness value <b>L</b> in the <b>HSL</b> color model.
The value of <b>0.500</b> gives you a medium gray color.
Remember that <b>A</b> stands for <b>alpha channel</b>, the opacity/transparency value you’ been working with in earlier Inkscape tutorials.
The gray color will not change during the animation, so leave the <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, and <b>blue</b> color recorder discs white.
The smoke ring will dissipate with time, so it will become transparent toward the end of the animation.
This feature is activated by clicking on the disc for <b>alpha</b>.
The smoke ring will move around, so its position needs to be recorded .
Click on the white discs for <b>center</b>, <b>horizontal radius</b>, and <b>vertical radius</b>.

Red arrows point to those items that are to be recorded by the <b>Animation Recorder</b>.
If you change the <b>Color model</b> option at the bottom of the <b>Fill and Stroke</b> panel to <b>HSV</b>, the color labels in the <b>Selected Objects</b> panel will change to <b>hue</b>, <b>saturation</b>, and <b>value</b> to reflect the change.
The color model changes, but the color does not.
With the circle still selected, click-drag it so that it sits over the top of the pipebowl.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Using the Timeline</span></h2>
The Timeline is where all the kinetic action takes place.
You can start an animation at one point in time, stop or pause it at another, change when things happen, and finally render everthing into a video clip.
In this section, you will make the smoke ring that you drew appear out of Dr.
McBirney's and float upwards, expanding out and fading as it goes.
The <b>Circle</b> object should be highlighted and a yellow disc should be visible under Time Frame <b>0</b>.
If, however, you see <b>Group</b>, then the two images (background and smoke ring) are still grouped.
Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G again.
If you still see <b>Group</b>, then troubleshoot.
Click on the <b>Group</b> label and then press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G.
The label should change into two labels: <b>Circle</b> and <b>layer1</b>.
Because the smoke ring object is located in the Frame 0 column, the animation will start immediately.
In this animation, you will have the animation start after one second of silence (a theatrical pause).
Click on the <b>Circle</b> label to make it the selected object.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/Tutorial20_circus.gif" alt="Tutorial 20 image of a circus poster" class="lazy">
The quality and color of your final printed output are determined by the process you follow to prepare an image for print.
Whether you’re printing a draft of your work on a desktop printer or outputting color separations to be printed on a commercial press, learning fundamental printing concepts helps ensure that your printed results meet your expectations.
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following: Different types of printing requirements and printing devices.
Printing concepts and printing terminology.
Basic color principles.
How to separate your color artwork into its component colors for output to print.
How to use spot colors for two-color printing.
Special considerations when outputting to print.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Printing: An Overview</span></h2>
When you print a document from a computer, data is sent from the document to the printing device, either to be printed on paper or to be converted to a positive or negative image on film.
For black-and-white, grayscale, or low quantities of color artwork, many people use desktop printers.
However, if you require large quantities of printed images, such as a brochure or magazine ad, you’ll need to prepare your artwork for output on a commercial printing press.
Printing on a commercial press is an art that requires time and experience to perfect.
In addition to close communication with a printing professional, learning basic printing concepts and terminology will help you produce printed results that meet your expectations.
<b>Note:</b> This lesson assumes that you have a desktop printer for use with the exercises.
If you don’t have a desktop printer available, read the sections and skip the step-by-step instructions.
Different printing requirements require different printing processes.
To determine your printing requirements, consider the following: What effect do you want the printed piece to have on your audience? Will your artwork be printed in black and white? Color? Does it require special paper? How many printed copies do you need? If you’re printing in color, is precise color matching necessary, or will approximate color matching suffice? Take a minute to consider several types of print jobs: <b>A black-and-white interoffice newsletter</b>, requiring a low quantity of printed copies.
For this type of printing job, you can generally use a 300-600 dpi (dots per inch) desktop laser printer to output the original, and then use a copy machine to reproduce the larger quantity.
<b>A business card using black and one other color.</b> The term two-color printing typically refers to printing with black and one other color, although it may also refer to printing with two colors that are not black.
Two-color printing is less expensive than four-color printing and lets you select exact color matches, called spot colors, which can be important for logos.
For precise color matching, two-color printing is done on a printing press; if only an approximate color match is required, you might use a desktop color printer.
<b>A party invitation using two colors and tints of those colors.</b> In addition to printing two solid colors, you can print tints of the colors to add depth to your printed artwork.
Two-color printing is often done on colored paper that compliments the ink colors and might be done on a desktop color printer or on a printing press, depending on the desired quantity and the degree of color matching required.
<b>A newspaper.</b> Newspapers are typically printed on a printing press because they are time-sensitive publications printed in large quantities.
In addition, newspapers are generally printed on large rolls of newsprint, which are then trimmed and folded to the correct size.
<b>A fashion magazine or catalog requiring accurate color reproduction.</b> Four-color printing refers to mixing the four process ink colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, or CMYK) for printed output.
When accurate color reproduction is required, printing is done on a printing press using CMYK inks.
CMYK inks can reproduce a good amount of the visible color spectrum, with the exception of neon or metallic colors.
You’ll learn more about color models in the next section.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">About Printing Devices</span></h2>
Now that you’ve looked at several types of publications and different ways to reproduce them, you’ll begin learning basic printing concepts and printing terminology.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Halftone Screens</h3>
To reproduce any type of artwork, a printing device typically breaks down the artwork into a series of dots of various sizes called a halftone screen.
Black dots are used to print black-and-white or grayscale artwork.
For color artwork, a halftone screen is created for each ink color (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black); these then overlay one another at different angles to produce the full range of printed color.
To see a good example of how individual halftone screens overlay each other at different angles on a printed page, look at a color comics page through a magnifying glass.
The size of the dots in a halftone screen determines how light or dark colors appear in print.
The smaller the dot, the lighter the color appears; the larger the dot, the darker the color appears.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/Halftone_Screen.png" alt="Enlarged detail showing dots 
<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Screen Frequency</h3>
Screen frequency (also called line screen ruling, or halftone frequency) refers to the number of rows or lines of dots used to render an image on film or paper.
In addition, the rows of dots are broken down into individual squares, called halftone cells.
Screen frequency is measured in lines per inch (<b>lpi</b>) and is a fixed value you can set for your printing device.
As a general rule, higher screen frequencies produce finer detail in printed output.
This is because the higher the screen frequency, the smaller the halftone cells, and subsequently, the smaller the halftone dot in the cell.
However, a high screen frequency alone does not guarantee high-quality output.
The screen frequency must be appropriate to the paper, the inks, and the printer or printing press used to output the artwork.
Your printing professional will help you select the appropriate screen value for your artwork and output device.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/image-asset.jpeg" alt="Pictures of the Mona Lisa shown at different screen frequencies" class="lazy">
Pictures of the Mona Lisa shown at different screen frequencies.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Output Device Resolution</h3>
The resolution of a printing device describes the number of dots the printing device has available to render, or create, a halftone dot.
The higher the output device resolution, the higher the quality of the printed output.
For example, the printed quality of an image output at 2400 dots per inch (<b>dpi</b>) is higher than the printed quality of an image output at 300 dpi.
Inkscape is resolution-independent and will always print at the printing device’s highest resolution capability.
The quality of printed output depends on the relationship between the resolution of the output device (<b>dpi</b>) and the screen frequency (<b>lpi</b>).
As a general rule, high-resolution output devices use higher screen frequency values to produce the highest quality images.
For example, an imagesetter with a resolution of 2400 dpi and a screen frequency of 177 lpi produces a higher quality image than a desktop printer with a resolution of 300 to 600 dpi and a screen frequency of 85 lpi.
Color is produced by a computer monitor and printing device using two different color models (methods for displaying and measuring color).
The human eye perceives color according to the wavelength of the light it receives.
Light containing the full color spectrum is perceived as white; in the absence of light, the eye perceives black.
The <i>gamut</i> of a color model is the range of colors that can be displayed or printed.
The largest color gamut is that viewed in nature; all other color gamuts produce a subset of nature’s color gamut.
The two most common color models are red, green, and blue (<b>RGB</b>), the method by which monitors display color; and cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (<b>CMYK</b>), the method by which images are printed using four process ink colors.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;The RGB Color Model</h3>
A large percentage of the visible spectrum of color can be represented by mixing three basic components of colored light in various proportions.
These components are known as the <b>additive colors</b>: red, green and blue (<b>RGB</b>).
The RGB color model is called the <b>additive color model</b> because various percentages of each colored light are added to create color.
All monitors display color using the <b>RGB</b> color model.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;The CMYK Color Model</h3>
If 100% of red, green, or blue is subtracted from white light, the resulting color is cyan, magenta, or yellow, respectively.
For example, if an object absorbs (subtracts) 100% red light and reflects green and blue, cyan is the perceived color.
Cyan, magenta, and yellow are called the <b>subtractive primaries</b>, and they form the basis for printed colors.
In addition to cyan, magenta, and yellow, black ink is used to generate true black and to deepen the shadows in images.
These four inks (<b>CMYK</b>) are often called <i>process colors</i> because they are the four standard inks used in the printing process.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;RGB and CMYK Color Models</h3>
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/ColorMixing.png" alt="Additive and subtractive color mixing models" class="lazy">
Additive and subtractive color mixing models.
The numbers are <b>rgb</b> color codes.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Spot Colors</h3>
Whereas process colors are reproduced using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, <i>spot colors</i> are premixed inks used in place of, or in addition to, CMYK colors.
Spot colors can be selected from color-matching systems, such as the <b>PANTONE®</b> or <b>TOYO™</b> color libraries.
Many spot colors can be converted to their process color equivalents when printed; however, some spot colors, such as metallic or iridescent colors, require their own plate on press.
Use spot colors in the following situations: To save money on one-color and two-color print jobs.
(When your printing budget won’t allow for four-color printing, you can still print relatively inexpensively using one or two colors.) To print logos or other graphic elements that require precise color matching.
You want the printer in San Francisco to use the same color of red as the printer in Seattle.
To print special inks, such as metallic, fluorescent, or pearlescent colors.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Getting Started</span></h2>
Start Inkscape.
Download art file <a href="#"><b>Tutorial20_start.svg</b></a> and store it in a convenient location.

Choose File &gt; Save As… and name the file <b>CommunityOutreach.svg</b>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Color Management</span></h2>
Although all color gamuts overlap, they don’t match exactly, which is why some colors on your monitor can’t be reproduced in print.
The colors that can’t be reproduced in print are called <i>out-of-gamut</i> colors because they are outside the spectrum of printable colors.
You might want or need to print your artwork on a special type of paper.
Paper types include: <i>repro paper</i> (offset or printing paper) <i>coated paper</i> (couché paper) <i>tissue paper</i> <i>newsprint paper</i> <i>cardboard</i> <i>Kraft paper</i> <i>paperboard</i>, and <i>fine arts paper types</i>, such as cold-press water-color paper, Hahnemühle German etching paper, luster photo paper, fiber papers, and many more among the plethora of species and subspecies of printing sheet media.
You might see a completely different set and range of colors on the printed sheet in comparison to what you see on your computer screen.
To compensate for these differences and to ensure the closest match between on-screen colors and printed colors, Inkscape includes a color management system (CMS) that lets you select profiles for your monitor and for the output device to which you’ll print.
Selecting a color profile controls the conversion of RGB values to CMYK values at print time.
To select a color profile, you use Inkscape’s color management system.
The point of color management is not to help you achieve better colors in print, but to help keep in check expectations as to how the artwork will print.
Color management, essentially, makes your RGB monitor represent colors as they appear when printed in CMYK.
Choose Edit &gt; Preferences… &gt; Input/Output &gt; Color management to bring up the <b>Color management</b> dialog box.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/ColorManagementDialogBox.gif" alt="Color management dialog box" class="lazy">
Color management dialog box.
In the <b>Display adjustment</b> section, click on the down-arrow in the current <b>Display profile</b> selection field.
Inkscape comes with two settings already installed: <b>&lt;none&gt;</b> and <b>sRGB61966-2.1</b>.
The default value is <b>&lt;none&gt;</b>.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/ColorManagementNone.gif" alt="Color management dialog box" class="lazy">
Color management display options <b>none</b> and <b>sRGB61966-2.1</b>.
The <b>sRGB61966-2.1</b> setting option comes from the North America General Purpose 2 display color setting.
It provides all-purpose general color settings for images on-screen, in print, and on the Web.
It is widely used in North America.
(The <b>sRGB</b> stands for <b>s</b>tandard <b>R</b>ed <b>G</b>reen <b>B</b>lue.) <b>sRGB</b> is often the “default” color space for images that contain no color space information.
In this tutorial, you can use either <b>&lt;none&gt;</b> or select the <b>sRGB61966-2.1</b> predefined set of color management settings provided in Inkscape.
Each set has a corresponding color profile and conversion options designed to preserve consistent color for a particular publishing workflow under typical conditions.
For more information on color management settings, visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management"> <b>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management</b></a>.
Choose the Display profile you desire and leave the remaining options at their default values.
Dismiss the dialog box.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Printing Black-and-White Proofs</h3>
As a general rule, you should print black-and-white proofs of all your documents at different stages of your work to check the layout and to verify the accuracy of text and graphics before preparing the document for final output.
Now you’ll print a draft of the <b>CommunityOutreach.svg</b> file.
Choose File &gt; Print, leave all choices set at the default and click <b>Okay</b>.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Soft-proofing Colors</h3>
In a color-managed work flow, you can use the precision of color profiles to soft-proof your document directly on the monitor.
Soft-proofing lets you preview on-screen how your document’s colors will look when reproduced on a particular output device.
The reliability of soft-proofing completely depends, however, on the quality of your monitor, your monitor profile, and the ambient lighting conditions of your workstation area.
In other words, if you are working in an inconsistent environment, with varying light throughout the day, you might not get reliable results.
Inkscape currently has only one device profile as a proof setting: <b>Agfa: Swop standard</b>.
Swop stands for <b>S</b>pecifications for <b>W</b>eb <b>O</b>ffset <b>P</b>ublications, which is both a company and name of a set of specifications whose goal is to make data for printing consistent, reliable, and of high quality across different printing and viewing devices.
For this tutorial, you will download and install a device profile developed by the European Color Initiative (ECI), an organization whose goal is to develop and enhance device-independent processing of color data in digital publication systems.
Click on <a href="https://www.athesiadruck.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Files/Downloads/PSO_Uncoated_ISO12647_eci.icc"><b>https://www.athesiadruck.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Files/Downloads/PSO_Uncoated_ISO12647_eci.icc</b></a> to download this device profile.
Right-click on the downloaded file and select <b>Install</b> in the short-cut menu.
(It’s just like installing a font, but this time it’s a color profile.) Exit Inkscape and then restart it so that Inkscape will “see” the new profile and add it to its list of device profiles.
<b>In the Color management</b> dialog box, click on the down arrow in the <b>Device profile</b> selection box.
Use the <b>Device profile</b> menu to select <b>PSO Uncoated ISO 12647 (ECI)</b>, which you just downloaded and installed.
Choose <b>View</b> and check the <b>Color-Managed View</b> checkbox to create a color preview.
The image automatically shifts colors to display what it would look like were it printed according to the PSO Uncoated ISO 12647 profile.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/HospitalOriginal.gif" alt="Community outreach image with color management turned off" class="lazy">

You’ll now return the settings to the SWOP settings.
Choose Edit &gt; Preferences… &gt; Input/Output &gt; Color management to bring up the <b>Color management</b> dialog box again.
Set the <b>Device profile</b> to <b>Agfa: Swop standard</b> and dismiss the dialog box.
Choose <b>View</b> and uncheck the <b>Color-Managed View</b> checkbox.
The image automatically shifts colors to display its original on-screen RGB coloration.
File &gt; Close to close the file.
Next, you’ll work with printing color artwork.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Creating Color Separations</h3>
To print color artwork on a printing press, you must first separate the composite art into its component colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, and any spot colors, if applicable.
The process of breaking down composite artwork into its component colors is called <i>color separation</i>.
Inkscape currently does not have the capability of producing color separations of artwork.
However, we have the opportunity here to create CMYK separations using a separate external program called <b>Scribus</b>.
<b>Scribus</b> has many of the graphic manipulation features that Inkscape has.
However, its focus is on preparing artwork for printing, either on a desktop printer or on a printing press.
Excepting the section on <b>Working with Two-Color Illustrations</b>, the remainder of this tutorial focuses on using Scribus as a means of producing CMYK color separations and registration marks that help guide a professional printer in printing and cutting sheets to your specifications.
I will remind you from time to time that you should consult your professional printer if you have any questions, uncertainties, or problems with document preparation.
They are professionals at what they do — they know their job.

<h4>Installing Scribus</h4>
Complete installation of Scribus is a two-step process.
You will download and install both Scribus and a helper program, <b>Ghostscript</b>.
The current version of Scribus is <b>Scribus 1.5.8</b>.
You can download it from <a href="https://www.scribus.net/downloads/"><b>https://www.scribus.net/downloads/</b></a>.
Read through which version of Scribus is best for you, download it, and install it keeping all default values.
Download and install the latest version of <b>Ghostscript</b> (Ghostscript 9.55.0) that’s appropriate for your computer from <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html"><b>https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html</b></a>.
Keep all default values during installation.
The Ghostscript executable files are located at C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.55.0\bin on my computer.
The <i>bin</i> subdirectory contains two versions of Ghostwriter: <b>gswin64.exe</b>, which is written in Postscript, and <b>gswin64c.exe</b>, which is brand new and is "written from the ground up" in the C programming language (hence the “c” in the gswin64c.exe).
The latest version of Scribus works only with Ghostwriter written in C.
Once both Ghostwriter and Scribus have been installed, you will enjoy a powerful tool that can help you prepare your artwork for printing both at home and at a professional printer.
Remember where <b>gswin64c.exe</b> is located so you can show Scribus where it is when you configure it.
Ghostscript is undergoing serious upgrading to conform better with advances in modern graphics capabilities.
The C version allows manipulation of transparency, along with other graphics tools, which the Postscript version cannot.
Ghostscript is important in allowing Scribus to import plain-vanilla and enhanced postscript files (.ps and .eps files).
You will import Inkscape files that have been converted into .ps or .eps files into Scribus.
<h5>Configuring Scribus</h5> For this tutorial, the only things you need to do are: Start Scribus.
Choose File &gt; Preferences.
Click on <b>External Tools</b>.
Enter the location of the Ghostscript executable file <b>gswin64c.exe</b> on your hard drive in the text field for <b>Postscript Interpreter</b> <u>N</u>ame of Executable:.
Fill out any other text fields in the form as you see fit (you can always come back to them later).

Note how many of the Scribus tool icons are similar to those in Inkscape.
They are drawn a little differently but the tool functions are the same.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Preparing the Image File for Saving as a Portable Document File (PDF)</h3>
Choose File &gt; <u>E</u>xport &gt; Save File as P<u>D</u>F… The <b>Save as PDF</b> dialog box appears.
The <b>General</b> dialog box is active by default.
Scribus automatically appends <b>.pdf</b> as the new file extension.
Leave the <b>Page Range</b> at the <b>All pages</b> default value.
We’ll suppose that the professional printer uses PDF 1.6 (Acrobat 7) compatible software their printer, so choose that option under <b>Compatibility</b>.
Leave all other options at their default values.

At the beginning of this tutorial, you learned that the relationship between the output device resolution and the screen frequency determines the quality of the printed output.
Depending on the output device you select, more than one screen frequency value may be available.
Your printing professional will direct you to select the screen frequency appropriate to your artwork.
Scribus makes the intelligent decision of 300 dots per inch since this resolution value is used very commonly on standard printing machines.
Your printing professional will direct you to select the screen frequency appropriate to your artwork if fine-adjusting screen and printer frequency is needed.
Click on the <b>Color</b> tab.
Select the <b>Printer</b> option in the <b>Output Intended For:</b> drop-down selection list.

There will be differences in coloration between what you see on the screen and what comes out of the printer.
Colors seen on-screen are RGB additive colors, while those same colors that are made in the printer with the CMYK subtractive color inks they use might produce small but important changes in hue, tinting, toning, or shading.
You can see these changes by choosing File &gt; Output Preview and switching between the <b>Screen / Web</b> and <b>Printer</b> Preview Settings panel in the <b>PDF Output Preview</b> dialog box.
Note the small difference in hue of the red striping on the tent object.

<b>Note:</b> There are two color bars: one greyscale and the other color.
Because the artwork is the size of a business card, the greyscale bar partially underlies the color bar.
The bar size is fixed for any size of artwork.
The document title also was not included because the default large size of the font prevents the text from fitting.
They appear in larger works, however, as you can see in the PDF proof of the circus poster.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Creating a Trap</span></h2>
<b>Trapping</b> is used to compensate for any gaps or color shifts that may occur between adjoining or overlapping objects when printing.
These gaps or color shifts occur from misregistration, the result of the paper or the printing plates becoming misaligned during printing.
Trapping is a technique developed by commercial print shops to slightly overprint the colors along common edges.

Gap created by misregistration.

Gap removed by trapping.
<b><i>About Traps</i></b> When overlapping painted objects share a common color, trapping may be unnecessary if the color that is common to both objects creates an automatic trap.
For example, if two overlapping objects contain cyan as part of their CMYK values, any gap between them is covered by the cyan content of the object underneath.
<b>Note:</b> When artwork contains common ink colors, overprinting does not occur on the shared plate — that is, the topmost overlapping printing ink appears opaque.
There are two types of traps: a <i>spread</i>, in which a lighter object overlaps a darker background and seems to expand into the background; and a <i>choke</i>, in which a lighter background overlaps a darker object that falls within the background and seems to squeeze or reduce the object.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/Spread.gif" alt="Spread trapping" class="lazy">
Spread: Object overlaps background.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/Choke.gif" alt="Choke trapping" class="lazy">
Choke: Background overlaps object.
Although Inkscape and Scribus don’t have trapping functionality at this time of writing, you can still discuss both spreads and chokes with your professional printer.
Your printer might recommend that you scale your graphic to its final size before a trap is added.
The thickness of a trapping increases or decreases if you scale the object.
For example, if a graphic has a 0.5-point trap and it is scaled up to five times its original size, the result is a 2.5-point trap for the enlarged graphic.
Although trapping sounds simple enough, it requires a thorough knowledge of color and design and an eye for determining where trapping is necessary.
Your professional printer can create a trap using two methods: by applying a trap filter or trap effect, for simple artwork whose parts can be selected and trapped individually; and by setting a stroke value for individual objects you want to trap.
Like printing, creating a trap is an art that requires time and experience.
We will now consider a simple kind of trap called <b>overprinting</b>.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Overprinting Objects</span></h2>
When preparing an image for color separation, you can define how you want overlapping objects of different colors to print.
By default, the top object in the Scribus artwork overprints, or lies ontop of, underlying artwork and prints with the color of the top object only.
If, however, you use a technique that knocks out, or eliminates any underlying color, misregistration (gaps between colors) might occur, as you can see below.

Second plate for the lion figure.
You can also specify to your professional printer an object to <i>overprint</i>, or print on top of, any of the artwork under them.
Overprinting is the simplest method you can use to prevent misregistration on press.
The overprinted color automatically traps into the background color.

Depending on what you have discussed with your printing professional, you might want to change the amount of trap specified.
It is much like changing the stroke thickness of a shape’s border using the <b>Stroke</b> palette in Inkscape.
Inkscape doesn’t have trapping functionality, but Scribus does.
If you want to explore what Scribus can do with trapping, choose Windows &gt; Properties.
Then, select an image or image frame.
You’ll see a boundary appear around the image and the text in the <b>Properties</b> panel will change from grey (inactive) to black (activated).
Click on the <b><u>C</u>olors</b> option and note the <b>Overprinting</b> field at the bottom of the dialog box.
<b>Knockout</b> and <b>Overprint</b> are the two options available to you.
This tutorial will not go any further with trapping because this subject is meant for printing, and working with printing machines and professional printers.
Inkscape’s focus is on graphic design.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Working with Two-Color Illustrations</span></h2>
Two-color printing generally refers to black and one spot color, but may also refer to two spot colors.
In addition to printing the two solid colors, you can print tints, or screens of the colors.
Two-color printing is much less expensive than four-color printing and lets you create a rich range of depth and color when used effectively.

<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Editing a Spot Color</h3>
In this section, you’ll open a two-color version of a circus illustration containing black, a spot color, and tints and a shade of that spot color (the lion figure has been shaded).
Before you separate the illustration, you’ll replace the current PANTONE spot color with another PANTONE color.
Exit Scribus and start Inkscape.
Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial20_start2.svg</b> file.

Spot color.
Next, you’ll replace every instance of the spot color (including any tints and shades of the color) with another spot color.
The Swatches palette has three different views which you can use.
In order to see the swatch color name and the swatch, choose View &gt; Swatches….
Click on the right-pointing arrow ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/RightPointingArrow.gif" alt="Right-pointing arrow" width="26">) at the top right of the color grid and then click on <b>List</b> at the top of the drop-down menu.
This view option provides you with a visual of the swatch, and its name or number.
In the figure below, I have set the <b>Size</b> to <b>Medium</b>, the <b>Width</b> to <b>Medium</b>, and the <b>Border</b> to <b>Wide</b>.

the swatch names.
Choose Select &gt; Deselect or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-click, or click away from the artwork to deselect the tent.
Next, you’ll replace the current PANTONE color with the new PANTONE color.
With the Selection tool ( <img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/images/SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection Tool icon" width="26">), click any colored part of the circus tent, just as you had done in Step 4.
Choose Edit &gt; Select Same &gt; Fill Color.

Note that colors that have been tinted or shaded are also selected.
In the Swatches palette, click on swatch PANTONE_193_C.
Almost all objects that were painted using spot color PANTONE_116_C are now painted with PANTONE_193_C, including all those objects that are tinted and shaded.
Objects that have been tinted or shaded retain their tints and shades with the new spot color or hue.
The only exception is the face and front of the acrobat.

You’ve finished the lesson.
In an ordinary workflow situation, you would now be ready to send your artwork to a commercial press to be printed.
Include proofs of color separation setups when you send your electronic file to a printer.
Also tell your printer about any traps you created in the artwork.
Keep in mind that you must remain in close communication with your printing professional for each print job.
Each print job has unique requirements that you must consider before you begin the process of color separation.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Questions</span></h2>
How do the RGB and CMYK color gamuts affect the relationship between on-screen colors and printed colors? How can you create a closer match between your on-screen colors and printed colors? What is the benefit of printing interim drafts of your artwork to a black-and-white desktop printer? What does the term color separation mean? What are two ways to output spot colors? What are the advantages of one- or two-color printing? What is trapping? What is a simple method you can use to create trap? 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Review Answers</span></h2>
Each color model has a gamut of color that overlaps, but does not precisely match the others.
Because monitors display color using the RGB color gamut and printed artwork used the smaller CMYK color gamut, there might be times when a printed color cannot precisely match an on-screen color.
You can select one of Inkscape’s built-in color management profiles to better simulate the relationship betwen on-screen colors and printed colors.
You can choose View &gt; Proof Setup and select an output device profile.
Then choose View &gt; Proof Colors to get an on-screen version of how the artwork will look when printed to the selected device.
It’s a good idea to print black-and-white drafts of your artwork on a desktop printer to check the layout and the accuracy of text and graphics in your publication before incurring the expense of printing to a color printer or imagesetter (for separations).
Color separation refers to breaking down composite artwork into its component colors — for example, using the four process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to reproduce a large portion of the visible color spectrum.
You can convert a spot color to its process color equivalents if a precise color match is not required, or you can output a spot color to its own separation.
One- or two-color printing is less expensive than four-color printing, and you can use spot colors for precise color matching.
Trapping is a technique developed by commercial print shops to slightly overprint the colors along common edges, and it is used to compensate for any gaps or color shifts that may occur between adjoining or overlapping objects when printed.
You can specify objects to overprint, or print on top of, any of the artwork under them.
Overprinting is the simplest method you can use to create a trap, which compensates for misregistration on press.

<h2><span class="orange">Thoughts and Theory on Tints, Tones, and Shading</span></h2>

Preparing a piece of graphic artwork for print using a printing press requires that attention be paid to details, such as brightness, contrast, gamma correction, the type of printer, and more, so that the printed result matches to satisfaction what you see on-screen.
Applying tinting, tones, and shading to enhance or subdue colors is part of the process.
The musings and theory presented below are directed to understanding what tint, tone, and shading are all about in a framework built on basic color theory, algebra, and geometry.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Defining Our RGB Color Space</span></h2>
Consider a 3-D cube whose x, y, and z axes represent the <b>R</b>ed, <b>G</b>reen, and <b>B</b>lue color space, or <b>RGB</b> space.
The origin, at point (0, 0, 0) represents black.
Diagonally opposite the origin, across the cube, is point (255, 255, 255), which represents white.
Each edge goes from 0 to 255 in color values.
There are 16,777,216 individual 24-bit color points contained in and on the cube that can be used to color an individual pixel.
Because each pixel can be colored individually, we have available to us, as graphic artists, what feels like an infinity of image possibilities.
The number of possibilities is huge to where your mind will melt, and yet it can be calculated and each color number can be manipulated with computer programming techniques.
We see this capability in action with Inkscape.

RGB color-space cube.
We can portray grayscale colors on the line segment that connects black at the cube’s origin (0, 0, 0), to white at point (255, 255, 255), along the cube’ body diagonal.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Color_Musings/Tints_Tones_Shades/images/GrayscaleLine.png"> 
<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Introduction to Color Shading</span></h2>
Consider a color, any color, inside the RGB color cube.
I picked (235, 199, 56), which is close to Bright Sun Yellow and RAL Zinc Yellow.
If you have either of these colors as a paint, you add shading to the color by adding a drop of pure black paint to a small amount of the yellow and mixing thoroughly.
To add more shading, you add another, and more drops of black paint, thoroughly mixing, until you achieve the degree of darkness that you are looking for (see <a href="https://www.beachpainting.com/blog/color-hue-tint-tone-and-shade/"><b>Beach Painting Contractors</b></a>).
You can create a shaded version of your original color by adding black in a drawing program, such as Inkscape.
It is just like moving the point that represents your original color, here Bright Sun Yellow, straight towards the origin of the color cube, which represents black.
Unlike your mixing bowl of paint, you can move your color point back and forth along the color path to adjust the degree of shading.
With the paint, you can only add black paint.
With Inkscape, you can both add and remove the black paint with a clear conscience.

Different shades of Bright Sun Yellow, including the end colors black and Bright Sun Yellow.
This color path that connects your original color to black can be reexpressed as a shading slider bar that you can adjust to integer precision (no real numbers — all color values are integer values).
The degree of shading, the RGB code for the new shaded color, the code for black, and, finally, the code for your starting color are all related by an equation shown below as a color example.
This equation is easy to translate into computer code that can then be made incarnate as an application dedicated to shading colors.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Introduction to Color Tinting</span></h2>
Color tinting works in the same way as with shading, except that now, we add pure white to our original color, instead of black (see <a href="https://www.beachpainting.com/blog/color-hue-tint-tone-and-shade/"><b>Beach Painting Contractors</b></a>).
The result is that we obtain a lighter, desaturated version of the original color.
The color tint path, which is also a straight line, now takes us from the original color inside the RGB color cube to the far corner of the cube where white (255, 255, 255) is located.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Color_Musings/Tints_Tones_Shades/images/Tint01.png" alt="Tinting path from our original color to the far corner of the color cube where pure white is located" class="lazy">
Tinting path from our original color at P(235, 199, 56) to the far corner of the color cube where pure white (255, 255, 255) is located.
The tinting path is not a continuation of the shading path.
When the color you want to shade or tint is off the grayscale path, the shading and tinting processes always take different paths from one another when it comes to color adjustment.
They appear as two line segments having different points of origin and orientations in the figure below.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Color_Musings/Tints_Tones_Shades/images/Tint02.png" alt="The tinting path is different from the shading path" class="lazy">
The tinting path is different from the shading path.
Just as with the shading path, points along the tinting path give you different tints of the original Bright Sun Yellow (or any color), simulating different proportions of white with the yellow.
<img class="lazy" data-src="https://roy-torley.github.io/Inkscape_Tutorial/Color_Musings/Tints_Tones_Shades/images/Tint03.png" alt="Different points along the tinting path yield different mixtures of white and Bright Sun Yellow" class="lazy">
Different points along the tinting path yield different mixtures of white and Bright Sun Yellow.
The tint path can be reexpressed as a color slider bar that demonstrates how you can mix different percentages of white and, here, Bright Sun Yellow to to achieve a lighter, desaturated version of the original color.
The equation that gives you the RGB code for the new desaturated color is shown under the bar in the figure below as an example of how values are used.
Like the equation shown earlier for shading, it is a basic algebraic equation used in a 3-D space where <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> are replaced by RGB.

<h2>&emsp;<span class="tomato">Introduction to Color Toning</span></h2>
Color toning takes shading and tinting up a notch when it comes to color manipulation.
Color toning is done by adding gray to your original color to subdue its hue, like shading with black and tinting with white.
However, gray does not come as a single hue or pure color.
You have light grays, medium grays, dark grays, off-white, off-black, and if you include black and white, there are 256 shades of gray on our RGB color cube’s grayscale line.
We won’t work with black and white in this section because they are used separately in shading and tinting.
Here, color toning involves strict grays whose gamut (color range) starts at (01, 01, 01) and ends at (254, 254, 254), not (0, 0, 0) to (255, 255, 255).
You will get a different range of colors to choose from when your color range ends (or starts) with a different shade of gray.
Below is one tone line that start with a particular spot color and ends on a light gray.
For example, the addition of light gray to your original color acts to subdue its intensity.

Toning a magenta color with light gray.
Now, keep the original color the same but change the gray tone to a darker gray.
See how the range of color changes to subdued, and yet darker possibilities for your color palette.

Toning a magenta color with dark gray.
Both ends of the color tone line can be changed.
This flexibility of 1) changing the lightness or darkness of your starting gray color <u>and</u> 2) of changing your starting spot color or hue requires working with two color gamuts: one gamut for the grayscale line and the other for your spot color or hue.
The gray that you choose from the grayscale line becomes the new beginning for the tone scale line.
You can now find a tone balance between a good gray and your original color to de-highlight the latter according to your vision.

The figure below shows how a light spot color can be made more subdued with the judicious application of light gray to its toning gamut.

Giving a lighter spot color a lighter gray tone.
Two color gamut slider bars can be coded and linked so that a result from the grayscale gamut slider is immediately applied to the beginning of the second tonal scale gamut for the spot color.
Color tones, being defined by two slider bars, allow you to create subtleties in color intensity that suggest differences in depth, how the viewer should direct their attention, and elicit different moods and feelings.
Percentages are for recording those selections of color that are important to your work.

Working with color tones requires a feel for what works best for your artwork.
As you experiment with different combinations of gray and spot color or hue, you will gain the experience and the intuition required to adjust colors freely, easily, and with confidence.
