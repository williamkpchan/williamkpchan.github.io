Using “5” produces a 4 pane grid. <br>To view two row (horizontal) panes side-by-side use the shortcut SHIFT-ALT-UP-2.

'Emmet makes coding HTML much easier by using abbreviations/shortcuts, based on CSS selectors.<br>with Emmet, just type lorem and hit tab.<br>Want a certain number of filler words (such as 100 words of lorem ipsum)? Use lorem100 instead.<br>Emmet also extends to CSS. For example, CSS vendor prefixes are always a pain, so Emmet lets you use the shorthand -bdrs to set a border radius<br>((h4>a[rel=external])+p>img[width=500 height=320])*12<br>It creates 12 lists of Headings followed with an image. I can then fill in my content without worrying about messing up the format.',
'The Git package lets you run Git commands (e.g. “Git Diff” or “Git Blame”) straight from ST3’s Command Palette.',
'GitGutter shows uncommitted additions, changes, and deletions next to ST3’s line numbers',
'SASS<br>ST3 doesn’t come with native SASS syntax and snippet support, but the ST3 package “SASS” adds it in. Highly recommended for advanced front-end developers and Ruby on Rails programmers',
'Multiple cursors are a killer feature of Sublime Text. It allows you to type in multiple places at the same time, saving you development time. To trigger multiple cursors, put your cursor on the word you want highlighted and hit CTRL-D till you have selected all the words you want. You can also create multiple cursors with CTRL-MOUSECLICK in all the places you want to have a cursor.',
'Goto Anything<br>Similar to the command palette, ST3 has the Goto Anything feature (pronounced “go to”) that can take you to a specific file, line, or method definition. Bring up Goto Anything’s search bar with CTRL-P. To switch between files, start typing the file’s name. Since its a fuzzy search, the search query doesn’t have to match the name exactly and you don’t have to type the whole file path:<br>Goto Anything doesn’t just take you to a file, it can also bring you to a specific line within a file. If you want to go to a line in the current file, just bring up Goto Anything and type a colon followed by the line number (e.g. :18 for line 18). To go to a line in another file, type the file name and then a colon and the line number:<br>If you want to go to a class, method, or function definition in a file, Goto Anything has a similar syntax as going to a line. Instead of colon, Goto Definition uses a @. You’ll get a list of all of the definitions in your chosen file and typing the name of one and hitting ENTER will take you to the given definition',
'Distraction Free Mode<br>Sometimes being the most productive coder means removing all distractions. No other applications, windows, tabs, sidebars, and menus. Sublime offers an easy way to do this through its Distraction Free Mode. Trigger it using SHIFT-F11',
'Hide/Show the Sidebar<br>The sidebar is useful for showing your files and directory structure, but sometimes you need a little more window space to code. Using the keyboard shortcut CTRL-K, CTRL-B (in this order) will toggle the sidebar. Remember a sidebar will only be viewable if you have multiple files or a folder open.',
'Quickly Comment Your Code<br>This is a useful tip if you’re constantly commenting your code or for temporarily testing how disabling a block of code affects your project. To comment code quickly in ST3, highlight the code and use CTRL-/. If you don’t highlight any code, using this shortcut will comment out the entire line.',
'Selecting Text<br>to select a word (CTRL-D)<br>to select the entire current line: CTRL-L.<br>to select all code that shares immediate indentation: CTRL-SHIFT-J.<br>to select everything inside the current HTML tag: CTRL-SHIFT-A',
'Indent Quickly<br>Developers know the importance of indentation because it keeps your code legible and easier to understand. If you want to increase the current line’s indent, useCTRL-]. Decreasing the indent uses the other square bracket key (CTRL-[).',
'Pasting with Indentation<br>When you copy/cut indented code and want to have the indentation level maintained when pasting, use CTRL-Shift-V to paste with indentation.',
'Switching Lines<br>Have you ever written code, only to realize that certain lines are out of order? ST3 has a time-saving shortcut that lets you move a given line up or down in a document. CTRL-SHIFT-UP moves a line up, while CTRL-SHIFT-DOWN moves a line down.',
'Deleting Lines<br>For the times when a line of code isn’t out of order, but needs to simply be removed, ST3 has handy shortcut for deleting lines without having to select the entire line. CTRL-SHIFT-K will delete the current line your cursor is on.',

'PackageResourceViewer<br>With PackageResourceViewer, you can view, and edit packages that come from SublimeText easily. You can also extract package, which will copy it to the User folder so you can safely edit it.',
'Terminal<br>This plugin lets you open your project folders in Terminal directly from SublimeText – with a hotkey. It is a very helpful plugin when you need to execute command lines at the given folder.',
'CSSComb<br>CSSComb is a plugin to sort CSS properties. If you need your codes to be tidy and in the right order, this plugin will let you customize the order of the properties. This is also helpful when you work with a team of developers, each with their own preferences of writing code.',
'CanIUse<br>With this plugin, you can check the browser support for CSS properties and HTML elements that you are using. To use it, highlight the CSS property or the HTML element, and it will bring you to the appropriate page in CanIUse.com.',
'Alignment<br>Alignment lets you align your codes including PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, thus making it neat and more readable.',
'Trimmer<br>This plugin helps you remove unnecessary spaces, as well as trailing spaces, which could cause some errors In JavaScript.',
'ColorPicker<br>With this plugin you can select and add colors to SublimeText with the native color wheel from your OS.',
'MarkDown Editing<br>Even though SublimeText is capable of viewing and editing Markdown files, it treats it as plain text with very poor formatting. This plugin is useful for giving better support with proper color highlighting for Markdown in SublimeText.',
'FileDiffs<br>FileDiffs allows you to see the differences between two files in SublimeText. You can compare files with copied data from Clipboard, a File in the Project, File that is currently open, and between saved and unsaved files.',

'Snippets<br>Snippets can help you write code faster by reusing code pieces. While you can also create your own set of code snippets, there are several snippet packages ready for use right away.',
'Foundation – A collection of snippets to build Foundation 5 framework components such as the Buttons, Tabs, and Navigation.',
'jQuery Mobile – A collection of snippets to build jQuery Mobile components and layouts.',
'HTML5 Boilerplate – this snippet lets you create HTML5 Boilerplate documents in a snap.',
'Additional Syntax Support<br>Languages that are not supported in SublimeText may not display with proper syntax highlighting. They include LESS, Sass, SCSS, Stylus, and Jade, so if you are working with those languages, here are the plugins to install, for syntax support.'
