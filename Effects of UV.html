<h1>Positive and negative effects of UV</h1>	

<p>The Earth’s <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/atmosphere" title="1. The layer of gas around the Earth. 2. (atm) A non-SI unit of pressure equivalent to 101.325 kPa.">atmosphere</a> blocks 98.7% of the Sun’s UV <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/radiation" title="Energy that is transmitted (radiates) from a source in the form of rays or waves or particles.">radiation</a> from penetrating through the atmosphere. The 2.3% that gets through has both positive and negative effects.</p><h2>Positive (beneficial) effects of UV</h2><p><b>Triggers <span>vitamin </span>D</b> – UV from the Sun is needed by our bodies to produce <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/vitamin" title="An organic compound required as a nutrient in tiny amounts by an organism.">vitamin</a> D. Vitamin D helps strengthen bones, muscles and the body’s <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/immune-system" title="The body&#39;s natural defence system. It helps to protect us against anything it recognises as being an &#39;invader&#39; or &#39;foreign&#39;, for example, bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, parasites and transplanted organs and tissues.">immune system</a>. It may also lower the risk of getting some kinds of cancers such as <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/colon" title="That part of the large intestine between the caecum and rectum. It consists of four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon.">colon</a> <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/cancer" title="The term for a group of more than 100 diseases in which abnormal cells divide and multiply uncontrollably.">cancer</a>.</p><p><b>Helps some skin conditions</b> – UV is used in the treatment of skin conditions such as psoriasis. This is a condition where the skin sheds its cells too quickly and develops itchy, scaly patches. Exposure to UV slows the growth of the skin cells and relieves the symptoms.</p><p><b>Helps moods</b> – Research suggests that sunlight stimulates the pineal gland in the brain to produce certain <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/chemicals" title="Everything is made up of chemicals. All matter (anything made of atoms) can be called chemicals. They can be in any form – liquid, solid or gas. Chemicals can be a pure substance or a mixture.">chemicals</a> called ‘tryptamines’. These chemicals improve our mood.</p><p><b>Helps some animals’ vision</b> – Some animals (including birds, bees and reptiles) are able to see into the near <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/UV-ultra-violet-light" title="Light that is invisible to the human eye and at a wavelength between 300–400 nanometres. UV light is what causes sun burn and can cause some types of cancer.">UV light</a> to locate many ripe fruits, flowers and seeds that stand out more strongly from the background. The fruits, flowers and seeds often appear quite different from how humans see them. For example, when seen in UV light, some flowers have different line markings, which may help direct bees and birds to the <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/nectar" title="A sugary liquid found in many flowers, made and stored in a nectary. Used to attract animals, which eat it and accidentally collect or deposit pollen at the same time.">nectar</a>.</p><p><b>Aids some insects’ navigation</b> – Many insects use UV emissions from celestial objects as references for navigating in flight. This is why a light sometimes attracts flying insects by disrupting their navigation process.</p>	<div class="pull-right inline-video-resource">

UV can effectively ‘kill’ (deactivate or destroy) microorganisms such as viruses and <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/bacteria" title="(Singular: bacterium) Single-celled microorganisms that have no nucleus.">bacteria</a>, for example, when hanging cloth nappies, underwear and tea-towels outside on the clothesline. To destroy the microorganisms, UV rays penetrate the <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/cell" title="1. Building block of the body. A human is made of millions of cells, which are adapted for different functions and can reproduce themselves exactly. 2.

These instructions are stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T).">DNA</a>, and so stops its ability to reproduce and multiply.

	</div><p><b>Causes sunburn</b> - UV burns the skin. Sunburn is a burn that occurs when skin cells are damaged. This damage to the skin is caused by the absorption of energy from UV rays. Extra blood flows to the damaged skin in an attempt to repair it, which is why your skin turns red when you are sunburnt.</p><p><b>Damages immune system</b> – Over-exposure to UV radiation has a harmful suppressing effect on the immune system. Scientists believe that sunburn can change the distribution and function of disease-fighting white blood cells in humans for up to 24 hours after exposure to the sun. Repeated over-exposure to UV radiation can cause even more damage to the body's immune system. The immune system defends the body against bacteria, microbes, viruses, toxins and <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/parasites" title="Plants or animals which live in or on another plant or animal, drawing nutriments (food requirements) from its host. Parasites usually cause harm to the host.">parasites</a> (disease and <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/infection" title="The invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues.">infection</a>). You can see how effective the immune system is by looking at how quickly something decays when it dies and the immune system stops working.</p><p><b>Damages eyes</b> – Prolonged exposure to UV or high intensities of UV (for example, in sunbeds) damages the tissues of eyes and can cause a ‘burning’ of the eye surface, called ‘snow blindness’ or <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/photokeratitis" title="A painful eye condition caused by too much light burning the cornea, for example, from using a welder’s torch or tanning beds without eye protection. Feels like having sand poured into the eyes.">photokeratitis</a>. The effects usually disappear within a couple of days, but may lead to further complications later in life. In 1998, the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> reported that even low amounts of sunlight can increase the risk of developing eye damage such as cataracts (which, left untreated, will cause blindness), pterygium and pinguecula. UV damage to the eyes is <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/cumulative" title="Gradually building up.">cumulative</a>, so it is never too late to start protecting the eyes.</p>	<div class="pull-right">

	</div><p><b>Ages skin</b> – UV speeds up the aging of skin, since the UV destroys <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/collagen" title="Any of various tough, fibrous proteins found in bone, cartilage, skin, and other connective tissue. Collagens have great strength and their job is to form strong insoluble fibres that connect cells. Collagen is converted into gelatin when it is boiled.">collagen</a> and connective tissue beneath the top layer of the skin. This causes wrinkles, brown ‘<a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/liver" title="A vital organ situated beside the stomach.

In biology, the dye-like material produced generally in the superficial parts of animals that gives colour to skin, eyes and hair.">pigmentation</a> on the underside of a person's arm and the top side of the same arm illustrate the effects of sun exposure on skin. Usually, the top side of the arm has had more exposure to the sun and shows greater sun damage. Because photo-aging of the skin is cumulative, it is never too late for a person to start a sun protection programme. Otherwise, though a tan may look good now, you could be paying for it with wrinkly leathery skin or skin cancer later.</p><p><b>Weakens plastics</b> – Many polymers used in consumer items (including plastics, nylon and polystyrene) are broken down or lose strength due to exposure to UV light.</p><p><b>Fades colours</b> – Many pigments (used for colouring food, cosmetics, fabric, <a href="/About-this-site/Glossary/plastic" title="A synthetic material made from a wide range of organic polymers (such as polyethylene, PVC and nylon) that can be moulded into shape while soft and then set into a rigid or slightly elastic form.">plastic</a>, paint, ink and other materials) and dyes absorb UV and change colour.
