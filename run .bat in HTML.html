<h1>Is it possible to run an .exe or .bat file on &#39;onclick&#39; in HTML</h1>

<p>Is it possible to run bat/executable file using html5 button event? In IE its achievable using  Shell object if I am not wrong.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Here's what I did. I wanted a HTML page setup on our network so I wouldn't have to navigate to various folders to install or upgrade our apps. So what I did was setup a .bat file on our "shared" drive that everyone has access to, in that .bat file I had this code:</p>

<pre><code>start /d "\\server\Software\" setup.exe
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML code was:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="button" value="Launch Installer" onclick="window.open('file:///S:Test/Test.bat')" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(make sure your slashes are correct, I had them the other way and it didn't work)</p>

<p>I preferred to launch the EXE directly but that wasn't possible, but the .bat file allowed me around that. Wish it worked in FF or Chrome, but only IE.</p>

<br><br>
<p>It is possible when the page itself is opened via a <code>file:///</code> path.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button onclick="window.open('file:///C:/Windows/notepad.exe')"&gt;
    Launch notepad
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the moment you put it on a webserver (even if you access it via <code>http://localhost/</code>), you will get an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: Access to 'file:///C:/Windows/notepad.exe' from script denied</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy">This allows to &quot;download&quot; notepad.exe, not run it. Firefox 31, Windows 7</span>

<br><br>
<p>You can not run/execute an .exe file that is in the users local machine or through a site. The user must first download the exe file and then run the executable file.<br> So there is no possible way<br> </p>

<p>The following code works only when the EXE is Present in the User's Machine.</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href = "C:\folder_name\program.exe"&gt;</code></p>
