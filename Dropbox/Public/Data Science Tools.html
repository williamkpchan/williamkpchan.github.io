<h1>19 Data Science Tools for people who aren&#8217;t so good at Programming</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Programming is an integral part of data science. Among other things, it is considered that a mind which understands programming logic, loops, functions has higher chances of becoming a successful data scientist. So, what about people who never studied programming subject in their school or college ?</p>
<p>Are they doomed to have a unsuccessful career in data science ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m sure there are countless people who want to enter data science domain but don&#8217;t understand coding very well. In fact, I too was a member of your non-programming league until I joined my first job. Therefore, I understand how terribly it feels when something you have never learnt haunts you at every step now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good news is, I found out a way! Rather, I&#8217;ve found out 19 ways using which you can ignite your appetite to learn data science without doing coding. These tools typically obviate the programming aspect and provide user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) so that anyone with minimal knowledge of <a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/common-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">algorithms</a> can simply used them to build predictive models.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many companies (specially startups) have recently launched GUI driven data science tools. I&#8217;ve covered most of tools available in industry today. Also, I&#8217;ve added some videos to enhance your learning experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: All the information provided is gather from open-source information sources. We are just presenting some facts and not opinions. In no manner do we intent to promote/advertise any of the products/services.</em></p>

<h2>List of Tools</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>More Tools</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have discussed a selected set of 10 examples above but there are many more like these. I&#8217;ll briefly name a few of them here and you can explore further if this isn&#8217;t enough to whet your appetite:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.experian.com/decision-analytics/marketswitch-optimization.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MarketSwitch</a> &#8211; This tool is more focussed on optimization rather than predictive analytics</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.algorithms.io/about.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">algorithms.io</a> &#8211; This tool works in the domain of IoT (Internet of Things) and performs analytics on connected devices</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.wise.io/machine-learning-applications" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wise.io</a> &#8211; This tool is focussed on customer handling and ticket system analytics</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.predixionsoftware.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Predixion</a> &#8211; This is another tool which works on data collected from connected devices</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.logicalglue.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logical Glue</a> &#8211; Another GUI based machine learning platform which works from raw data to deployment</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.purepredictive.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Predictive</a> &#8211; This tool uses a patented Artificial Intelligence system which obviates the part of data preparation and model tuning; it uses AI to combine 1000s of models into what they call &#8220;supermodels&#8221;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.featurelab.co" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FeatureLab</a> &#8211; It allows easy predictive modeling and deployment using GUI</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re hearing these names for the first time, you&#8217;ll be surprised (like I was :D) that so many tools exist. But the good thing is that they haven&#8217;t had a disruptive impact as of now. But the real question is will these technologies achieve their goals? Only time can tell!</p>
