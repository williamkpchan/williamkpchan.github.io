<H2>Abstract</H2>

<p>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language
used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one
platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic
semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a
wide range of applications. This specification extends HTML to
support locally executable scripts including JavaScript, VBScript,
and other scripting languages and systems.

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This specification extends HTML to support client-side scripting
of HTML documents and objects embedded within HTML documents.
Scripts can be supplied in separate files or embedded directly
within HTML documents in a manner independent of the scripting
language. Scripts allow HTML forms to process input as it is
entered: to ensure that values conform to specified patterns, to
check consistency between fields and to compute derived fields.

<p>Scripts can also be used to simplify authoring of active
documents. The behaviour of objects inserted into HTML documents can
be tailored with scripts that respond to events generated by such
objects. This enables authors to create compelling and powerful web
content. This specification covers extensions to HTML needed for
client-side scripting, but leaves out the architectural and
application programming interface issues for how scripting engines
are implemented and how they communicate with the document and other
objects on the same page.

<hr>
<h3><a name="script">The SCRIPT Element</a></h3>

<pre>
&lt;!-- SCRIPT is a character-like element for embedding script code
      that can be placed anywhere in the document HEAD or BODY --&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT script - - CDATA&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST script
        type         CDATA    #IMPLIED -- media type for script language --
        language     CDATA    #IMPLIED -- predefined script language name --
        src          %URL     #IMPLIED -- URL for an external script --
        &gt;
</pre>

<p>The content model for the SCRIPT element is defined as CDATA. In
this kind of element, only one delimiter is recognized by a
conforming parser: the end tag open (ETAGO) delimiter (i.e. the
string "&lt;/"). The recognition of this delimiter is constrained to
occur only when immediately followed by an SGML name start character
([a-zA-Z]). All characters which occur between the SCRIPT start tag
and the first occurrence of ETAGO in such a context must be provided
to the appropriate script engine. 

<p>Note that all other SGML markup (such as comments, marked
sections, etc.) appearing inside a SCRIPT element are construed to
be actual character content of the SCRIPT element and not parsed as
markup. A particular script engine may choose to treat such markup
as it wishes; however a script engine should document such
treatment.

<p>The restriction on appearance of the ETAGO delimiter may cause
problems with script code which wishes to construct HTML content in
the code. For example, the following code is invalid due the to
presence of the "&lt;/EM&gt;" characters found inside of the SCRIPT
element:

<pre>
    &lt;SCRIPT type="text/javascript"&gt;
      document.write ("&lt;EM&gt;This won't work&lt;/EM&gt;")
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>A conforming parser would treat the "&lt;/EM&gt;" data as an end
tag and complain that it was an end tag for an element not opened,
or perhaps actually close an open element. In any case, it is
recognized as markup and not as data.

<p>In JavaScript, this code can be expressed legally as follows by
ensuring that the apparent ETAGO delimiter does not appear
immediately before an SGML name start character:

<pre>
    &lt;SCRIPT type="text/javascript"&gt;
      document.write ("&lt;EM&gt;This will work&lt;\/EM&gt;")
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>In Tcl this looks like:

<pre>
    &lt;SCRIPT type="text/tcl"&gt;
      document write "&lt;EM&gt;This will work&lt;\/EM&gt;"
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>In VBScript, you can avoid the problem with the <tt>Chr()</tt>
function, e.g.

<pre>    "&lt;EM&gt;This will work&lt;\" &amp; Chr(47) + "EM&gt;"</pre>

<p>Each scripting language should recommend language specific
support for resolving this issue.

<p>The following describe the attributes used with SCRIPT elements,
all of which are optional:

<dl>
<dt><b>TYPE</b>
<dd>The Internet media type specifying the scripting language,
for instance: <tt>type="text/javascript"</tt> or
<tt>type="text/vbscript"</tt>.

<dt><b>LANGUAGE</b>
<dd>Names the scripting language using well known identifiers, for
instance "JavaScript" or "VBScript". This attribute is deprecated in
favor of the TYPE attribute.

<dt><b>SRC</b>
<dd>The optional SRC attribute gives a URL for an external script.
If a SRC attribute is present, the content of the SCRIPT element
should be ignored.
</dl>

<p>HTML documents can include multiple SCRIPT elements, which can be
placed in the document HEAD or BODY. This allows script statements
for a form to be placed near to the corresponding FORM element. Note
that some script engines evaluate script statements dynamically as the
document is loaded, so that there is the possibility that references
to objects occurring later in the document will fail.

<p>If authors include script elements with different scripting languages
in the same document, then user agents should attempt to process statements
in each such language. This corresponds to programs with some procedures
written in one language, and others in another language, e.g. C and FORTRAN.

<h4><a name=deflang>Default Scripting Language</a></h4>

<p>The default scripting language in the absence of TYPE or LANGUAGE
attributes can be specified by by a META element in the document
HEAD, for example:

<pre>    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Script-Type" CONTENT="text/tcl"&gt;</pre>

<p>where the CONTENT attribute specifies the media type for the
scripting language, and the HTTP-EQUIV attribute is the literal
string "Content-Script-Type". If there are several such META
elements the last one determines the scripting language.

<p>In the absence of such a META element, the default can be set by
a Content-Script-Type HTTP header in the server response, for
example:

<pre>
    Content-Script-Type: text/tcl
</pre>

<p>If there are several such headers, the last one takes precedence
over earlier ones.

<p><i>Note that in the absence of either a META element or an HTTP
header, many user agents assume the default scripting language to
be JavaScript.</i>

<h4><a name="side_effects">Self-Modifying Documents</a></h4>

<p>Some scripting languages permit script statements to be used to
modify the document as it is being parsed. For instance, the HTML
document:

<pre>
    &lt;title&gt;Test Document&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        document.write("&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;\/b&gt;")
    &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Has the same effect as the document:

<pre>
    &lt;title&gt;Test Document&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;/b&gt;
</pre>

<p>From the perspective of SGML, each script element is evaluated by
the application and can be modelled as a two-step process: (1)
dynamically defining an anonymous CDATA entity; corresponding to the
combined text written by all of the <em>document.write</em> or equivalent
statements in the script element and (2) referencing the entity
immediately after parsing the script end tag. HTML documents are
constrained to conform to the HTML document type definition both before
processing any script elements and after processing all script elements.

<h3><a name=noscript>The NOSCRIPT element</a></h3>

<pre>
    &lt;!ELEMENT noscript - - (%body.content)&gt;
</pre>

<p>The content of this element is rendered only when the user agent
doesn't support client-side scripting, or doesn't support a scripting
language used by preceding script elements in the current document.
It gives authors a means to provide an invitation to upgrade to a
newer browser, and is designed to work with downlevel browsers. The
NOSCRIPT element can be placed anywhere you can place an HTML DIV
element.

<pre>
    &lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;
      &lt;P&gt;This document works best with script enabled browsers
    &lt;/NOSCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="handlers">Examples of Event Handlers using SCRIPT</a></h3>

<p>You can include the handler for an event in an HTML document using the
SCRIPT element. Here is a VBScript example of an event handler for a text
field:

<pre>
    &lt;INPUT NAME=edit1 size=50&gt;    
    &lt;SCRIPT TYPE="text/vbscript"&gt;
      Sub edit1_changed()
        If edit1.value = "abc" Then
          button1.enabled = True
        Else
          button1.enabled = False
        End If
      End Sub
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here is the same example using Tcl:

<pre>
    &lt;INPUT NAME=edit1 size=50&gt;
    &lt;SCRIPT TYPE="text/tcl"&gt;
      proc edit1_changed {} {
        if {[edit value] == abc} {
          button1 enable 1
        } else {
          button1 enable 0
        }
      }
      edit1 onChange edit1_changed
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here is a javascript example for event binding within a script:
First, here's a simple click handler:

<pre>    &lt;script language=JavaScript&gt;
      function my_onclick() {
         . . .
      }

      document.form.button.onclick = my_onclick
    &lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Here's a more interesting window handler:

<pre>    &lt;script language=JavaScript&gt;
      function my_onload() {
         . . .
      }

      var win = window.open("some/other/URL")
      if (win) win.onload = my_onload
    &lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>In Tcl this looks like:

<pre>
    &lt;script language=tcl&gt;
        proc my_onload {} {
          . . .
        }
        set win [window open "some/other/URL"]
        if {$win != ""} {
            $win onload my_onload
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2><a name=scope>Scoping of Object Names</a></h2>

<p>Scripting engines are responsible for binding object references
in scripts to objects associated with documents. Script engines may
support more than one language. This allows handlers to be written
in one language, and the event binding to be defined in another,
thereby avoiding the limitations of particular languages.

<p>Some scripting languages like VBScript provide language
conventions for binding objects that source events to script
functions that handle events. Other languages typically allow you a
run-time mechanism to set up such bindings, e.g. to register
call-backs, or a way to poll for events and dispatch them to
appropriate handlers.

<p>How do scripts reference objects? In many cases objects associated
with HTML elements such as form fields can be identified by virtue of
the document markup, e.g. the tag names and attribute values. HTML ID
attributes provide identifiers that are unique throughout a given
document, while NAME attributes for elements defining form fields are
limited in scope to the enclosing FORM element.

<p>Scripting systems may allow authors to script objects that occur
within an object associated with an OBJECT or IMG element. Document
frames allow one document to be nested in another. Script handlers
could be placed in a parent document and used to control the
behaviour of a child document. Scripts may also be used for objects
external to documents, such as the user agent or other applications.
A particularly simple form of scripting is to just wire up objects
that source events with ones that sink events. One event may be
multicast to several recipient objects.

<p>One way to deal with naming is to introduce language specific
naming conventions, e.g. "document.form1.button1" as used by
JavaScript. Another is to rely on the context in which a SCRIPT
element is located to guide search for a named object. For instance,
if the SCRIPT element is within a FORM element, objects associated
with form elements with matching NAME values may be sought in
preference to elements with matching ID values.

<p>Some scripting languages, such as VBScript, limit the scope of
references to a given module, but don't provide language specific
means for defining modules. If a module is associated with an HTML
document then element ID values can be used for binding handlers to
objects. If the module is associated with an HTML form, then form
field NAME attribute values could in principle be used by the script
engine to unambigously bind handlers to objects by placing the
handlers in a SCRIPT element within the associated FORM element.

<hr>
<h2><a name="intrinsic">Intrinsic Events</a></h2>

<p>A number of common events can be handled using attributes placed on
the HTML elements associated with the object generating the event. The
attribute names for intrinsic events are case insensitive. The attribute
value is a scripting language dependent string. It gives one or more
scripting instructions to be executed whenever the corresponding event
occurs. Note that <i>document.write</i> or equivalent statements in
intrinsic event handlers create and write to a new document rather than
modifying the current one.

<p>In the following example, userName is a required text field. When a
user attempts to leave the field, the OnBlur event calls a JavaScript
function to confirm that userName has an acceptable value.

<pre>
    &lt;INPUT NAME="userName" onBlur="validUserName(this.value)"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here is another JavaScript example:

<pre>
    &lt;INPUT NAME="num"
        onChange="if (!checkNum(this.value, 1, 10)) 
            {this.focus();this.select();} else {thanks()}"
        VALUE="0"&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Scripting Language</h4>

<p>The scripting language assumed for intrinsic events is determined by
the <a href="#deflang">default scripting language</a> as specified above
for the SCRIPT element.

<h4>SGML Parsing of intrinsic event handler attributes</h4>

<p>The script attributes for intrinsic events are defined as CDATA. The
SGML processing of CDATA attribute values requires that (1) entity
replacement occur within the attribute value; and (2) that the attribute
value be delimited by the appearence LIT ( " ) or LITA ( ' ). The
literal delimiter which terminates the attribute value must be the same
as the delimited used to initiate the attribute value. Given these
lexical restrictions, the delimiters LIT or LITA, ERO (entity reference
open - '&amp;'), and CRO (character reference open - "&amp;#") may not freely
occur as script code within a script event handler attribute. To resolve
this issue, it is recommended that script event handler attributes
always use LIT delimiters and that occurrences of '"' and '&' inside an
event handler attribute be written as follows:

<pre>
    '"'  should be written as "&amp;quot;" or as "&amp;#34;"
    '&'  should be written as "&amp;amp;"  or as "&amp;#38;"
</pre>

<p>For example:

<pre>
    &lt;INPUT NAME="num"
      onChange="if (compare(this.value, &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;)) {gethelp()}"
      VALUE="0"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that SGML permits LITA ( ' ) to be included in attribute strings
quoted by LIT ( " ), and vice versa. The following is therefore okay:

<pre>    "this is 'fine'" and 'so is "this"'</pre>

<p>The following is an example of how intrinsic events are
specified in the HTML document type definition:

<pre>
    &lt;!ATTLIST SELECT
        name        CDATA       #REQUIRED
        size        NUMBER      #IMPLIED
        multiple   (multiple)   #IMPLIED
        onFocus     CDATA       #IMPLIED
        onBlur      CDATA       #IMPLIED
        onChange    CDATA       #IMPLIED
        &gt;
</pre>

<h3>The Set of Intrinsic Events</h3>

<p>The set of intrinsic events are listed below together with
the HTML elements they can be used with. This set is expected
to grow slightly:

<dl>
<dt><b>onLoad</b>
<dd>A load event occurs when the browser finishes loading a window or
all frames within a FRAMESET. The onLoad event handler executes the
scriptlet when a load event occurs. This attribute can only be used with
BODY or FRAMESET elements.

<dt><b>onUnload</b>
<dd>An unload event occurs when you exit a document. The onUnload event
handler executes the scriptlet when an unload event occurs. This attribute
can only be used with BODY or FRAMESET elements.

<dt><b>onClick</b>
<dd>A click event occurs when an anchor or form field is clicked. The
onClick event handler executes the scriptlet when a click event occurs.
This event is generated by buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, hypertext
links, reset and submit buttons. This attribute can only be used with
INPUT, and anchor elements.

<dt><b>onMouseOver</b>
<dd>This event is sent as the mouse is moved onto an anchor. This
attribute can only be used with anchor and AREA elements.

<dt><b>onMouseOut</b>
<dd>This event is sent as the mouse is moved out of an anchor or
textarea element. This attribute can only be used with anchor and
AREA elements.

<dt><b>onFocus</b>
<dd>A focus event occurs when a field gains the input focus by tabbing
or clicking with the mouse. Selecting within a field results in a select
event, not a focus event. This attribute can only be used with the SELECT,
INPUT and TEXTAREA elements.

<dt><b>onBlur</b>
<dd>A blur event occurs when a form field loses the input focus. This
attribute can only be used with the SELECT, INPUT and TEXTAREA elements.


<dt><b>onSubmit</b>
<dd>A submit event occurs when a user submits a form. This may be
used to control whether the form's contents are actually submitted or
not. For instance, JavaScript won't submit the form if a scriptlet for
the onSubmit event returns false. This attribute can only be used with
the FORM element.

<dt><b>onSelect</b>
<dd>A select event occurs when a user selects some of the text within a
single or multi-line text field. This attribute can only be used with the
INPUT and TEXTAREA elements.

<dt><b>onChange</b>
<dd>A change event occurs when a form field loses the input focus and
its value has been modified. This attribute can only be used with the
SELECT, INPUT and TEXTAREA elements.
</dl>

<p><em><b>Note</b> some user agents support
<samp>onMouseover</samp>, <samp>onMouseOut</samp> and
<samp>onClick</samp> on a much wider variety of elements, not just
the elements listed above.</em>

<hr>
<h2><a name="macros">Reserved Syntax for HTML CDATA attributes</a></h2>

<P>This specification reserves syntax for the future support of
script macros in HTML CDATA attributes. The intention is to allow
attributes to be set depending on the properties of objects that
appear earlier on the page. The syntax is:

<pre>   attribute = "... &amp;{ <i>macro body</i> }; ... "</pre>

<p>The remainder of this section describes current practice for the
use of script macros, but is not a normative part of this
specification.

<h3>Current Practice for Script Macros</h3>

<p>The macro body is made up of one or more statements in the
default scripting language (as per instrinsic event attributes).
The semicolon following the right brace is always needed, as
otherwise the right brace character "}" is treated as being
part of the macro body. Its also worth noting that quote marks
are always needed for attributes containing script macros.

<p>The processing of CDATA attributes proceeds as follows:

<ol>
<li>The SGML parser evaluates any SGML entities, e.g. "&amp;gt;"
<li>Next the script macros are evaluated by the script engine
<li>Finally the resultant character string is passed to the
application for subsequent processing.
</ol>

<p>Note that macro processing takes place when the document is
loaded (or reloaded) but isn't redone when the document is resized
or repainted etc.

<p>Here are some examples using JavaScript. The first one randomizes
the document background color:

<pre>    &lt;BODY BGCOLOR='&{randomrbg()};'&gt;</pre>

<p>Perhaps you want to dim the background for evening viewing ...

<pre>    &lt;BACKGROUND SRC='&{if(Date.getHours &gt; 18)...};'&gt;</pre>

<p>The next example uses JavaScript to set the coordinates
for a client-side image map:

<pre>    &lt;MAP NAME=foo&gt;
      &lt;AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="&{myrect(imageurl)};" HREF="&{myurl};"&gt;
    &lt;/MAP&gt;</pre>

<p>This example sets the size of an image based upon document properties:

<pre>    &lt;IMG SRC=bar.gif WIDTH='&{document.banner.width/2};' HEIGHT='50%'&gt;</pre>

<p>You can programmatically set the URL for a link or image:

<pre>
    &lt;SCRIPT&gt;
      function manufacturer(widget) {
          ...
      }
      function location(manufacturer) {
          ...
      }
      function logo(manufacturer) {
          ...
      }
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

    &lt;A HREF='&{location(manufacturer("widget"))};'&gt;widget&lt;/A&gt;

    &lt;IMG SRC='&{logo(manufacturer("widget"))};'&gt;
</pre>

<p>This last example shows how SGML CDATA attributes can be quoted
using single or double quote marks. If you use single quotes around the
attribute string then you can include double quote marks as part of the
attribute string. Another approach is use &amp;quot; for double quote
marks, e.g.

<pre>   &lt;IMG SRC="&{logo(manufacturer(&amp;quot;widget&amp;quot;))};"&gt;</pre>

<hr>
<h3><a name=ui>Using form fields without a NAME attribute</a></h3>

<p>For an INPUT, TEXTAREA or SELECT element to be considered as
part of a form, when submitting the form's contents, both of the
following conditions must apply:

<ol type="a">
<li>The element must have a NAME attribute.
<li>The element must be contained by a FORM element.
</ol>

<p>If either of these two conditions are not met, then the field
is not treated as being part of a form. This allows fields such as
text fields and buttons to be used together with scripting to build
user interfaces independent of the role of these elements for
forms.

<hr>
<h2><a name="deployment">Deployment Issues</a></h2>

<p>Authors may wish to design their HTML documents to be viewable on
older browsers that don't recognise the SCRIPT element. Unfortunately
any script statements placed within a SCRIPT element will be visible to
users.  Some scripting engines for languages such as JavaScript,
VBScript and Tcl allow the script statements to be enclosed in an SGML
comment syntax, for instance:

<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--  to hide script contents from old browsers
  function square(i) {
    document.write("The call passed ", i ," to the function.","&lt;BR&gt;")
    return i * i
  }
  document.write("The function returned ",square(5),".")
// end hiding contents from old browsers  --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>The JavaScript engine allows the string "&lt;!--" to occur at the
start of a SCRIPT element, and ignores further characters until the
end of the line. JavaScript interprets "//" as starting a comment
extending to the end of the current line. This is needed to hide
the string "--&gt;" from the JavaScript parser.

<p>Down-level browsers will ignore the SCRIPT start and end tags and
interpret the "&lt;!--" string as the start of an SGML comment. In this
way the contents of the SCRIPT element are hidden within an SGML comment.

<p>In VBScript a single quote character causes the rest of the
current line to be treated as a comment. It can therefore be used
to hide the string "-->" from VBScript, for instance:

<pre>
   &lt;SCRIPT TYPE="text/vbscript"&gt;
     &lt;!--
       Sub foo()
        ...
       End Sub
     ' --&gt;
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>In Tcl, the "#" character comments out the rest of the line:

<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="tcl"&gt;
&lt;!--  to hide script contents from old browsers
  proc square {i} {
    document write "The call passed $i to the function.&lt;BR&gt;"
    return [expr $i * $i]
  }
  document write "The function returned [square 5]."
# end hiding contents from old browsers  --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<p>Some browsers close comments on the first ">" character, so to hide
script content from such browsers, you can transpose operands for
relational and shift operators (e.g. to use "y &lt; x" rather than
"x &gt; y") or to use scripting language dependent escapes for ">".
