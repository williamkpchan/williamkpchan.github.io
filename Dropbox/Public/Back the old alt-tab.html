<h1 >Getting back the old alt-tab windows switching behavior in Windows 7</h1>

<p>When you run more than 6 applications on Windows 7 and you press alt-TAB, icons representing the first 6 applications and the desktop appear on the first row of the grid and you can cycle with alt-TAB-TAB... through the 6 most recently used windows the usual way, but the 7th and other less recently used windows don't follow the same rules. Instead they get grouped together according to their application but disregarding whether they were recently used or not. This new behavior is mentioned <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/07/01/8673981.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am very used to the old way of cycling and the new system is driving me crazy. I tend to have 20 or so windows open at one time and I frequently need to alt-tab to the 7th or 8th window on the stack but it doesn't work the same anymore.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to put back the old behavior, so that alt-tab-tab-tab... goes through the whole list in most-recent to least-recent order?</p>

<p>To restore the XP Alt-Tab functionality simply, lauch regedit, add a <strong>DWORD</strong> named <strong><code>AltTabSettings</code></strong> to <strong><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer</code></strong> and set its value to <strong><code>1</code></strong>.</p>

<p>And here's a one line powershell script which does the above:</p>

<pre><code>Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer AltTabSettings ([int]1)
</code></pre>
