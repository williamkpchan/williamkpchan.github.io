<p><b>D3</b> allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. <br>For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. <br>Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.

<p>D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. <br>
  Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data. This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. <br>With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. <br>D3's functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/API-Reference">components</a> and <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins">plugins</a>.

<h2><a name="selections" href="#selections">#</a>Selections</h2>

<p><aside>Read <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Selections">more about selections</a>.</aside>

<p>Modifying documents using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR">W3C DOM API</a> is tedious: the method names are verbose, and the imperative approach requires manual iteration and bookkeeping of temporary state. <br>For example, to change the text color of paragraph elements:

<pre><code>var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
for (var i = 0; i &lt; paragraphs.length; i++) {
  var paragraph = paragraphs.item(i);
  paragraph.style.setProperty("color", "white", null);
}</code></pre>

<p>D3 employs a declarative approach, operating on arbitrary sets of nodes called <i>selections</i>. For example, you can rewrite the above loop as:

<pre><code>d3.selectAll("p").style("color", "white");</code></pre>

<p>Yet, you can still manipulate individual nodes as needed:

<pre><code>d3.select("body").style("background-color", "black");</code></pre>

<p>Selectors are defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/">W3C Selectors API</a> and supported natively by modern browsers. <br>Backwards-compatibility for older browsers can be provided by <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/">Sizzle</a>. <br>The above examples select nodes by tag name (<code>"p"</code> and <code>"body"</code>, respectively). <br>Elements may be selected using a variety of predicates, including containment, attribute values, class and ID.

<p>D3 provides numerous methods for mutating nodes: setting attributes or styles; registering event listeners; adding, removing or sorting nodes; and changing HTML or text content. <br>These suffice for the vast majority of needs. <br>Direct access to the underlying DOM is also possible, as each D3 selection is simply an array of nodes.

<h2><a name="properties" href="#properties">#</a>Dynamic Properties</h2>

<p>Readers familiar with other DOM frameworks such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> or <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> should immediately recognize similarities with D3. <br>Yet styles, attributes, and other properties can be specified as <i>functions of data</i> in D3, not just simple constants. Despite their apparent simplicity, these functions can be surprisingly powerful; the <code>d3.geo.path</code> function, for example, projects <a href="http://geojson.org/">geographic coordinates</a> into SVG <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData">path data</a>. <br>D3 provides many built-in reusable functions and function factories, such as <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes">graphical primitives</a> for area, line and pie charts.

<p>For example, to randomly color paragraphs:

<pre><code>d3.selectAll("p").style("color", function() {
  return "hsl(" + Math.random() * 360 + ",100%,50%)";
});</code></pre>

<p>To alternate shades of gray for even and odd nodes:

<pre><code>d3.selectAll("p").style("color", function(d, i) {
  return i % 2 ? "#fff" : "#eee";
});</code></pre>

<p>Computed properties often refer to bound data. <br>Data is specified as an array of values, and each value is passed as the first argument (<code>d</code>) to selection functions. <br>With the default join-by-index, the first element in the data array is passed to the first node in the selection, the second element to the second node, and so on.<br> For example, if you bind an array of numbers to paragraph elements, you can use these numbers to compute dynamic font sizes:

<pre><code>d3.selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
    .style("font-size", function(d) { return d + "px"; });</code></pre>

<p>Once the data has been bound to the document, you can omit the <code>data</code> operator;<br> D3 will retrieve the previously-bound data. This allows you to recompute properties without rebinding.

<h2><a name="enter-exit" href="#enter-exit">#</a>Enter and Exit</h2>

<p><aside>Read <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">more about data joins</a>.</aside>

<p>Using D3's <i>enter</i> and <i>exit</i> selections, you can create new nodes for incoming data and remove outgoing nodes that are no longer needed.

<p>When data is bound to a selection, each element in the data array is paired with the corresponding node in the selection.<br> If there are fewer nodes than data, the extra data elements form the enter selection, which you can instantiate by appending to the <code>enter</code> selection. For example:

<pre><code>d3.select("body")
  .selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
  .enter().append("p")
    .text(function(d) { return "I'm number " + d + "!"; });</code></pre>

<p>Updating nodes are the default selection—the result of the <code>data</code> operator. <br>Thus, if you forget about the enter and exit selections, you will automatically select only the elements for which there exists corresponding data.<br> A common pattern is to break the initial selection into three parts: <br>the updating nodes to modify, the entering nodes to add, and the exiting nodes to remove.

<pre><code>// Update…
var p = d3.select("body")
  .selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
    .text(function(d) { return d; });

// Enter…
p.enter().append("p")
    .text(function(d) { return d; });

// Exit…
p.exit().remove();</code></pre>

<p>By handling these three cases separately, you specify precisely which operations run on which nodes. <br>This improves performance and offers greater control over transitions. <br>For example, with a bar chart you might initialize entering bars using the old scale, and then transition entering bars to the new scale along with the updating and exiting bars.

<p>D3 lets you transform documents based on data; this includes both creating and destroying elements. <br>D3 allows you to change an existing document in response to user interaction, animation over time, or even asynchronous notification from a third-party. <br>A hybrid approach is even possible, where the document is initially rendered on the server, and updated on the client via D3.

<h2><a name="transformation" href="#transformation">#</a>Transformation, not Representation</h2>

<p>D3 does not introduce a new visual representation. Unlike <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphaël</a>, or <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis</a>, D3's vocabulary of graphical marks comes directly from web standards: HTML, SVG, and CSS. For example, you can create SVG elements using D3 and style them with external stylesheets. <br>You can use composite filter effects, dashed strokes and clipping. <br>If browser vendors introduce new features tomorrow, you'll be able to use them immediately—no toolkit update required. <br>And, if you decide in the future to use a toolkit other than D3, you can take your knowledge of standards with you!

<p>Best of all, D3 is easy to debug using the browser's built-in element inspector: the nodes that you manipulate with D3 are exactly those that the browser understands natively.

<h2><a name="transitions" href="#transitions">#</a>Transitions</h2>

<p>D3's focus on transformation extends naturally to animated transitions. Transitions gradually interpolate styles and attributes over time. <br>Tweening can be controlled via easing functions such as “elastic”, “cubic-in-out” and “linear”. D3's interpolators support both primitives, such as numbers and numbers embedded within strings (font sizes, path data, <i>etc.</i>), and compound values. You can even extend D3's interpolator registry to support complex properties and data structures.

<p>For example, to fade the background of the page to black:

<pre><code>d3.select("body").transition()
    .style("background-color", "black");</code></pre>

<p>Or, to resize circles in a symbol map with a staggered delay:

<pre><code>d3.selectAll("circle").transition()
    .duration(750)
    .delay(function(d, i) { return i * 10; })
    .attr("r", function(d) { return Math.sqrt(d * scale); });</code></pre>

<p>By modifying only the attributes that actually change, D3 reduces overhead and allows greater graphical complexity at high frame rates. <br>D3 also allows sequencing of complex transitions via events. And, you can still use CSS3 transitions; D3 does not replace the browser's toolbox, but exposes it in a way that is easier to use.
