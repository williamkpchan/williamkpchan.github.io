<h1>32 Easy Exercises to Boost Your Creativity Everyday
</h1>


<p>For a lot of people, creativity is a talent that few people have.
</p>

<p>For me, creativity is a skill we all have and can improve with regular exercise.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>"Creativity is not just for artists. It's for businesspeople looking for a new way to close a sale; it's for engineers trying to solve a problem; it's for parents who want their children to see the world in more than one way."
	<em>--Twyla Tharp</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are 32 simple, daily exercises you can choose from to enhance your creativity. They are short workouts for your&nbsp;

<p>To make it into a&nbsp;

</a>, schedule "15 minutes of creativity" into your calendar and try a different exercise each day.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw something--fruit, your coffee cup, your dog, cat, children--for 5-10 minutes. Just draw, don't judge and don't erase.
</li>
<li>Draw an apple a day using a different technique each day, for a week. My friend&nbsp;
	<a href="http://carbonesmolan.com/press/my-beautiful-obsession-1.html">Ken Carbone
</a>&nbsp;did this daily, for 365 days.
</li>
<li>Buy a set of color pencils. Draw parallel lines freehand or with a ruler. Color them in a la&nbsp;

</a>.
</li>
<li>Use a drawing program on your i-Pad, my favorite is SketchPad, to draw half of something and have the mirror effect draw the other half. Try symmetrical things like bottles, vases, forks, pencils.
</li>
<li>Take your sketchbook to a concert and sketch or write ideas that pop into your head as you're listening to music.
</li>
<li>Make something new, funny or weird with objects lying on your desk.
</li>
<li>Collect a bunch of things from your recycling bin. Combine them together to make an abstract sculpture. Use a hot glue gun or lots of tape to hold it together.
</li>
<li>Look up a word in the dictionary, and then look up the word before and after. Make up a short story using the three words (loosely inspired by Twyla Tharp, from her book&nbsp;

</a>).
</li>
<li>Make new things with paper clips (earrings, letters of the alphabet, a heart). See how many things you can make in 5 minutes.
</li>
<li>Find one thing that starts with the first letter of your first name and another with the first letter of your last name. Mash them together to make a new thing: Apple for Ayse + Bus for Birsel = Apple shaped bus. Draw it.
</li>
<li>Draw something on your desk, i.e. your stapler, without looking at your hand in 5 minutes. Cover your hand and drawing with a paper towel to not cheat. When done, take away the towel. Tadaaa! You'll be amazed.
</li>
<li>Pick a song you love and sing it with new lyrics.
</li>
<li>Write a poem about your day in the style of your favorite poet (Maya Angelou for example).
</li>
<li>Take a photo, or a selfie, open it in Photoshop or PowerPoint and write HELLO! in large letters in a fun font, save as PDF and attach it to your emails for the day.
</li>
<li>Take a&nbsp;
	<a href="http://learningdifferences.com/Main%20Page/Topics/Compound%20Word%20Lists/Compound_Word_%20Lists_complete.htm">compound word
</a>&nbsp;made up of two words. Separate them. Replace one of the words with a new word to make up new compound word. List as many combinations as you can.
</li>
<li>Go to a museum with your sketchbook and draw a painting or a sculpture that inspires you (if you can't take the time, go outside your door and draw a tree or a mailbox). It doesn't matter how crude or crooked your drawing and I guarantee that you will never forget what you just drew.
</li>
<li>Write something you want to solve in your notebook before you go to sleep.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://inc.com/business-insider/how-to-productively-sleep-on-an-idea.html">Sleep on your problem
</a>&nbsp;and let your subconscious do the work. When you wake up, ideate in your notebook.
</li>
<li>Look at clouds and imagine them as things, just like when you were a kid.
</li>
<li>Borrow your kid's Playdo and make a sculpture for 15 minutes. Use&nbsp;

</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;
<a href="http://centrepompidou.fr/en/Collections/Brancusi-s-Studio">Brancusi
</a>&nbsp;as inspiration.
</li>
<li>Next borrow your kids Legos and make a plan for your dream house, pool included. You can also do this virtually on Minecraft.
</li>
<li>Cover your table completely with large easel paper. Draw on it large, free style, stream of consciousness, using a Sharpie (make sure Sharpie doesn't seep through) for 10 minutes or until the whole table is covered. Tape it all together and tack it on your wall.
</li>
<li>Take 5 minutes to write a haiku (Japanese style 3 line poem with a 5-7-5 syllable structure) about your day or night.
</li>
<li>Next time you're cooking, change a key ingredient and experiment.
</li>
<li>Gather materials (foil, q-tips, wire pipe cleaners, colorful paper or post-its, paper clips, some string, buttons, pushpins, and any other odds and ends) and glue them together to make something. If you have young kids, do this together.

<li>Channel Stefan Sagmeister, the graphic designer and author of&nbsp;

</a>. Formulate your life's motto and write it in sugar or salt, or with flowers, or make a sketch of how you'd like to write it in a forest or across a pool.
</li>
<li>Mash up very new and very old technology and play with new ideas. Uber + Horse Carts. Apple Watch + Sun dial. Write and draw them.
</li>
<li>Do any page of Keri Smith's&nbsp;

</a>. My favorite: FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ATTACH THESE TWO PAGES.
</li>
<li>Print a portrait of someone you love or admire. Put tracing paper over it and redraw their face. Don't judge and don't erase. Try this with your own face for a self-portrait.
</li>
<li>Collect branches that look like letters on one of your hikes and write your name with them when you're home. Take a photo and post on Instagram.
</li>
<li>Draw something without lifting your pen.
</li>
<li>Learn how to draw something realistically, like an eye on this YouTube tutorial (this will take more than 15 minutes).
</li>
<li>Take a different route home and take photographs of the new things you see along the way. Post on Instagram, #creativeeveryday.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is what I've learned from these creative warm-ups: my thinking continues to be more flexible and multi-dimensional throughout the day. I approach work challenges with less fear and more playfully; I'm more open to see things in new and unexpected ways... And
	<em>that&nbsp;
</em>makes all the difference.
</p>

<p>How about you? Do you have some favorite creative exercises? I would love to hear from you.
</p>

<p>Design the life and work you love!
