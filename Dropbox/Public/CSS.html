<h2>CSS Style Sheet</h2>
   <p>We will start with a style sheet embedded inside the HTML file.
    Later, we will put the HTML and the CSS in separate files. Separate
    files is good, since it makes it easier to use the same style sheet
    for multiple HTML files: you only have to write the style sheet
    once. But for this step, we just keep everything in one file.

   <p>We need to add a &lt;style&gt; element to the HTML file. The
    style sheet will be inside that element. So go back to the editor
    window and add the following five lines in the head part of the
    HTML file. The lines to add are shown in red<span class=hide>
    (lines 5 to 9)</span>.

   <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  <strong>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    color: purple;
    background-color: #d8da3d }
  &lt;/style&gt;</strong>
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
[etc.]
</pre>

   <p>The first line says that this is a style sheet and that it is
    written in CSS (“text/css”). The second line says that we add
    style to the “body” element. The third line sets the color of
    the text to purple and the next line sets the background to a sort
    of greenish yellow.

   <div class=advanced>

    <p><img  src=gevaar.png> Style
     sheets in CSS are made up of <em>rules</em>. Each rule has three
     parts:

    <ol>
     <li>the <em>selector</em> (in the example: “body”), which
      tells the browser which part of the document is affected by the
      rule;

     <li>the <em>property</em> (in the example, 'color' and
      'background-color' are both properties), which specifies what
      aspect of the layout is being set;

     <li>and the <em>value</em> ('purple' and '#d8da3d'), which gives
      the value for the style property.
    </ol>

    <p>The example shows that rules can be combined. We have set two
     properties, so we could have made two separate rules:

    <pre>
body { color: purple }
body { background-color: #d8da3d }
</pre>

    <p>but since both rules affect the body, we only wrote “body”
     once and put the properties and values together. For more about
     selectors, see <a href="../../LieBos2e/enter/" hreflang=en>chapter
     2</a> of <cite>Lie &amp; Bos</cite>.
   </div>

   <p>The background of the body element will also be the background of
    the whole document. We haven't given any of the other elements (p,
    li, address…) any explicit background, so by default they will
    have none (or: will be transparent). The 'color' property sets the
    color of the text for the body element, but all other elements
    inside the body inherit that color, unless explicitly overridden.
    (We will add some other colors later.)

   <p>Now save this file (use “Save” from the File menu) and go
    back to the browser window. If you press the “Reload” button,
    the display should change from the “boring” page to a colored
    (but still rather boring) page. Apart from the list of links at the
    top, the text should now be purple against a greenish yellow
    background.

   <div class=figure>
    <p><img alt="Screenshot of the colored page in Konqueror"
     src=snapshot12.png>

    <p>How one browser shows the page now that some colors have been
     added.
   </div>

   <div class=advanced>
    <p><img alt="Alert! Advanced:" class=sign src=gevaar.png> <img
     alt="" class=illustration src="../../CSS/colors"> Colors can be
     specified in CSS in several ways. This example shows two of them:
     by name (“purple”) and by hexadecimal code (“#d8da3d”).
     There are about 140 color names and the hexadecimal codes allow
     for over 16 million colors. <a href="../../../MarkUp/Guide/Style"
     hreflang=en><cite>Adding a touch of style</cite></a> explains more
     about these codes.
   </div>
  </div>

  <div class=section id=fonts>
   <h2>Step 3: adding fonts</h2>

   <p>Another thing that is easy to do is to make some distinction in
    the fonts for the various elements of the page. So let's set the
    text in the “Georgia” font, except for the h1 heading, which
    we'll give “Helvetica.”

   <p>On the Web, you can never be sure what fonts your readers have on
    their computers, so we add some alternatives as well: if Georgia is
    not available, Times New Roman or Times are also fine, and if all
    else fails, the browser may use any other font with <a
    href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=serif"
    hreflang=en> serifs.</a> If Helvetica is absent, Geneva, Arial and
    SunSans-Regular are quite similar in shape, and if none of these
    work, the browser can choose any other font that is serif-less.

   <p>In the text editor add the following lines<span class=hide>
    (lines 7-8 and 11-13)</span>:

   <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    <strong>font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",
          Times, serif;</strong>
    color: purple;
    background-color: #d8da3d }
  <strong>h1 {
    font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,
          SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }</strong>
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
[etc.]
</pre>

   <p>If you save the file again and press “Reload” in the browser,
    there should now be different fonts for the heading and the other
    text.

   <div class=figure>
    <p><img alt="Screenshot with fonts added" src=snapshot13.png>

    <p>Now the main text has a different font from the heading.
   </div>
  </div>

  <div class=section id=navbar>
   <h2>Step 4: adding a navigation bar</h2>

   <p>The list at the top of the HTML page is meant to become a
    navigation menu. Many Web sites have some sort of menu along the
    top or on the side of the page and this page should have one as
    well. We will put it on the left side, because that is a little
    more interesting than at the top…

   <p>The menu is already in the HTML page. It is the &lt;ul&gt; list
    at the top. The links in it don't work, since our “Web site” so
    far consists of only one page, but that doesn't matter now. On a
    real Web site, there should not be any broken links, of course.

   <p>So we need to move the list to the left and move the rest of the
    text a little to the right, to make room for it. The CSS properties
    we use for that are 'padding-left' (to move the body text) and
    'position', 'left' and 'top' (to move the menu).

   <p>There are other ways to do it. If you look for “column” or
    “layout” on the <a href="../../CSS/learning"
    hreflang=en><cite>Learning CSS</cite></a> page, you will find
    several ready-to-run templates. But this one is OK for our
    purposes.

   <p>In the editor window, add the following lines to the HTML
    file<span class=hide> (lines 7 and 12-16)</span>:

   <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    <strong>padding-left: 11em;</strong>
    font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",
          Times, serif;
    color: purple;
    background-color: #d8da3d }
  <strong>ul.navbar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 2em;
    left: 1em;
    width: 9em }</strong>
  h1 {
    font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,
          SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
[etc.]
</pre>

   <p>If you save the file again and reload it in the browser, you
    should now have the list of links to the left of the main text.
    That already looks much more interesting, doesn't it?

   <div class=figure>
    <p><img alt="Screenshot with menu on the left" src=snapshot14.png>

    <p>The main text has been moved over to the right and the list of
     links is now to the left of it, instead of above.
   </div>

   <div class=advanced>
    <p><img alt="Alert! Advanced:" class=sign src=gevaar.png> The
     'position: absolute' says that the ul element is positioned
     independently of any text that comes before or after it in the
     document and the 'left' and 'top' indicate what that position is.
     In this case, 2em from the top and 1em from the left side of the
     window.

    <p>'2em' means 2 times the size of the current font. E.g., if the
     menu is displayed with a font of 12 points, then '2em' is 24
     points. The 'em' is a very useful unit in CSS, since it can adapt
     automatically to the font that the reader happens to use. Most
     browsers have a menu for increasing or decreasing the font size:
     you can try it and see that the menu increases in size as the font
     increases, which would not have been the case, if we had used a
     size in pixels instead.
   </div>
  </div>

  <div class=section id=links>
   <h2>Step 5: Styling the links</h2>

   <p>The navigation menu still looks like a list, instead of a menu.
    Let's add some style to it. We'll remove the list bullet and move
    the items to the left, to where the bullet was. We'll also give
    each item its own white background and a black square. (Why? No
    particular reason, just because we can.)

   <p>We also haven't said what the colors of the links should be, so
    let's add that as well: blue for links that the user hasn't seen
    yet and purple for links already visited<span class=hide> (lines
    13-15 and 23-33)</span>:

   <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    padding-left: 11em;
    font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",
          Times, serif;
    color: purple;
    background-color: #d8da3d }
  ul.navbar {
    <strong>list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;</strong>
    position: absolute;
    top: 2em;
    left: 1em;
    width: 9em }
  h1 {
    font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,
          SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }
  <strong>ul.navbar li {
    background: white;
    margin: 0.5em 0;
    padding: 0.3em;
    border-right: 1em solid black }
  ul.navbar a {
    text-decoration: none }
  a:link {
    color: blue }
  a:visited {
    color: purple }</strong>
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
[etc.]
</pre>

   <div class=advanced>
    <p><img alt="Alert! Advanced:" class=sign src=gevaar.png>
     Traditionally, browsers show hyperlinks with underlines and with
     colors. Usually, the colors are similar to what we specificed
     here: blue for links to pages that you haven't visited yet (or
     visited a long time ago), purple for pages that you have already
     seen.

    <p>In HTML, hyperlinks are created with &lt;a&gt; elements, so to
     specify the color, we need to add a style rule for “a”. To
     differentiate between visited and unvisited links, CSS provides
     two “pseudo-classes” (:link and :visited). They are called
     “pseudo-classes” to distinguish them from class
     <em>attributes,</em> that appear in the HTML directly, e.g., the
     <code>class="navbar"</code> in our example.
   </div>
  </div>

  <div class=section id=rule>
   <h2>Step 6: adding a horizontal line</h2>

   <p>The final addition to the style sheet is a horizontal rule to
    separate the text from the signature at the bottom. We will use
    'border-top' to add a dotted line above the &lt;address&gt;
    element<span class=hide> (lines 34-37)</span>:

   <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    padding-left: 11em;
    font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",
          Times, serif;
    color: purple;
    background-color: #d8da3d }
  ul.navbar {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 2em;
    left: 1em;
    width: 9em }
  h1 {
    font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,
          SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }
  ul.navbar li {
    background: white;
    margin: 0.5em 0;
    padding: 0.3em;
    border-right: 1em solid black }
  ul.navbar a {
    text-decoration: none }
  a:link {
    color: blue }
  a:visited {
    color: purple }
  <strong>address {
    margin-top: 1em;
    padding-top: 1em;
    border-top: thin dotted }</strong>
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
[etc.]
</pre>

   <p>Now our style is complete. Next, let's look at how we can put the
    style sheet in a separate file, so that other pages can share the
    same style.
  </div>

  <div class=section id=external>
   <h2>Step 7: putting the style sheet in a separate file</h2>

   <p>We now have an HTML file with an embedded style sheet. But if our
    site grows we probably want many pages to share the same style.
    There is a better method than copying the style sheet into every
    page: if we put the style sheet in a separate file, all pages can
    point to it.

   <p>To make a style sheet file, we need to create another empty text
    file. You can choose “New” from the File menu in the editor, to
    create an empty window. (If you are using TextEdit, don't forget to
    make it plain text again, using the Format menu.)

   <p>Then cut and paste everything that is inside the &lt;style&gt;
    element from the HTML file into the new window. Don't copy the
    &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; themselves. They belong to HTML,
    not to CSS. In the new editor window, you should now have the
    complete style sheet:

   <pre>
body {
  padding-left: 11em;
  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman",
        Times, serif;
  color: purple;
  background-color: #d8da3d }
ul.navbar {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 2em;
  left: 1em;
  width: 9em }
h1 {
  font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,
        SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }
ul.navbar li {
  background: white;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
  padding: 0.3em;
  border-right: 1em solid black }
ul.navbar a {
  text-decoration: none }
a:link {
  color: blue }
a:visited {
  color: purple }
address {
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding-top: 1em;
  border-top: thin dotted }
</pre>

   <p>Choose “Save As…” from the File menu, make sure that you
    are in the same directory/folder as the mypage.html file, and save
    the style sheet as “mystyle.css”.

   <p>Now go back to the window with the HTML code. Remove everything
    from the &lt;style&gt; tag up to and including the &lt;/style&gt;
    tag and replace it with a &lt;link&gt; element, as follows<span
    class=hide> (line 5)</span>:

   <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My first styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  <strong>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt;</strong>
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
[etc.]
</pre>

   <p>This will tell the browser that the style sheet is found in the
    file called “mystyle.css” and since no directory is mentioned,
    the browser will look in the same directory where it found the HTML
    file.

   <p>If you save the HTML file and reload it in the browser, you
    should see no change: the page is still styled the same way, but
    now the style comes from an external file.

   <div class=figure>
    <p><img alt="Final result of styling" src=snapshot15.png>

    <p>The final result
   </div>

   <p>The next step is to put both files, mypage.html and mystyle.css
    on your Web site. (Well, you might want to change them a bit
    first…) But how to do that depends on your Internet provider.
  </div>
