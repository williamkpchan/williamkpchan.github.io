<H3>What is FTP?</H3>
<DD>The FTP (<B>F</B>ile <B>T</B>ransfer
<B>P</B>rotocol) utility program is
commonly used for copying files to and from other computers.  These
computers may be at the same site or at different sites thousands of
miles apart.   FTP is a general protocol that works on UNIX systems
as well as a variety of other (non-UNIX) systems.
<BR><BR>
<DD>For the purposes of this Web page, the <EM>local</EM> machine
refers to the machine you are initially logged into, the one on which
you type the <B>ftp</B> command.  The <EM>remote</EM> machine
is the other one, the one that is the argument of the <B>ftp</B> command.
<BR><BR>
<DD>A user interface for the standard File Transfer Protocol for
ARPANET, FTP acts as an interpreter on the remote
machine.  The user may
type a number of UNIX-like commands under this interpreter to
perform desired actions on the remote machine.
<BR><BR>
<DD>Most operating systems and communication programs now include
some form of an FTP utility program, but the commands
differ slightly between them.  
The following explanations and alphabetical list
of commands refers to the common FTP utility program as
provided on a UNIX machine.  Check the documentation for your
own machine to determine the comparable commands.
<BR><BR>
<DD>Most computers today include a windows-based type FTP program
that is more PC-oriented and does not require full knowledge of
these commands.
<DD>You can also perform FTP through a browser. 
For example, bring up Internet Explorer and type in
<P>
	&#160 &#160 &#160
	&#160 &#160 &#160
       <TT>ftp://<I>yourLoginName@IPaddress</I></TT>
<P>
instead of a normal web page URL.
<BR><BR>
<FONT>
The FTP site of the Computer Science department at CSU requires the
user to use <B>sftp</B>, the secure version of FTP. Just type <B>sftp</B>
instead of <B>ftp</B>, when you are using FTP in a terminal window.
</FONT>
<BR><BR>

<DL>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
<DD>To connect your local machine to the remote machine, type
<P>
	&#160 &#160 &#160
	&#160 &#160 &#160
       <TT>ftp</TT> <EM>machinename</EM>
<P>
where <EM>machinename</EM> is the full machine name of the remote machine,
e.g., <TT>purcell.cs.colostate.edu</TT>.  If the name of the machine is unknown,
you may type
<P>
	&#160 &#160 &#160
	&#160 &#160 &#160
       <TT>ftp</TT> <EM>machinennumber</EM>
<P>
where <EM>machinennumber</EM> is the net address of the remote machine,
e.g., <TT>129.82.45.181</TT>.  In either case, this command is similar to
logging onto the remote machine.  If the
remote machine has been reached
successfully, FTP responds by asking for a <EM>loginname</EM>
and <EM>password</EM>.
<P>
<DD>When you enter your own <EM>loginname</EM> and <EM>password</EM> for the
remote machine, it returns the prompt
<P>
	&#160 &#160 &#160
	&#160 &#160 &#160
       <TT>ftp></TT>
<P>
and permits you access to your own home directory
on the remote machine.  You should be able to move around in your own
directory and to copy files to and from your local machine
using the FTP interface commands given on the following page.
</DL>
<P><HR NOSHADE><P>
<DL>
<H3>Anonymous FTP</H3>
<DD>At times you may wish to copy files from a remote machine on which you
do not have a <EM>loginname</EM>.  This can be done using <EM>anonymous</EM>
FTP.
<P>
<DD>When the remote machine asks for your <EM>loginname</EM>, you should type
in the word <TT>anonymous</TT>.  Instead of a <EM>password</EM>, you should
enter your own electronic mail address.  This allows the remote site to
keep records of the anonymous FTP requests.  
<P>
<DD>Once you have been logged in, you are in the <TT>anonymous</TT>
directory for the remote machine.  This usually contains a number of
public files and directories.  Again you should be able to move around
in these directories.  However, you are only able to copy the files
from the remote machine to your own local machine; you are not able
to write on the remote machine or to delete any files there.
