</p><h3>Definitions - Databases, Queries, Relational Databases, SQL, MySQL</h3>
<p class="line874">A database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer system. A database relies upon software to organize the storage of data.  </p><p class="line874">A query is a line of text that a user sends to a database telling it what you want it to do. It is usually written in SQL (Structured query language). </p><p class="line874">Example of SQL query: </p><pre>select * from books where price &lt; 20.00 order by title;
</pre><p class="line874">The term "relational database" comes from "Relation", a mathematical term loosely meaning "table", and thus "relational" roughly means "based on tables". </p><p class="line874">MySQL is a popular database management system within which you can set up and query databases. Many web applications use databases. Youtube, flickr, and wikipedia are all built on MySQL databases. A lot of biological databases (e.g. GO, ensembl) are already available in mysql database tables, or are easily input into a database for easy querying. </p><p class="line874">For example, lets say I have a database table with yeast genes and some information about them (created by parsing a text file from SGD): </p><p class="line867"></p><pre>Here's the first 5 rows of the table, as an example.


mysql&gt; select id,chrom,start,end,strand,sys_id,gene_name from yeast_genes_07 limit 5;
+----+-------+-------+------+--------+-----------+-----------+
| id | chrom | start | end  | strand | sys_id    | gene_name |
+----+-------+-------+------+--------+-----------+-----------+
|  1 | 1     |   335 |  649 | W      | YAL069W   | NULL      |
|  2 | 1     |   538 |  792 | W      | YAL068W-A | NULL      |
|  3 | 1     |  1807 | 2169 | C      | YAL068C   | NULL      |
|  4 | 1     |  2480 | 2707 | W      | YAL067W-A | NULL      |
|  5 | 1     |  7236 | 9017 | C      | YAL067C   | SEO1      |
+----+-------+-------+------+--------+-----------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre><p class="line874">Using a database, I can slice and dice the information in this table using almost-english queries like this: </p><p class="line867"></p><pre>select * from yeast_genes_07 where strand = 'W' and start &lt; 5000 and chrom = 5;

</pre><p class="line874">which means - show me all the information about genes whose strand is W, start is less than 5000, and are on chromosome 5. </p><p class="line874">We have a bunch of databases here at stowers. Additionally, MySQL is installed by default on pretty much any linux system I've ever run into. </p>
</p><h3>RMySQL</h3>
<p class="line874">RMySQL is a little tricky to install, depending on your version of R. Here's some places to look for more info if you have trouble:  <a class="http" href="http://www.phaget4.org/R/R_notes.html">http://www.phaget4.org/R/R_notes.html</a> <br>
<a class="http" href="http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/07/10/28442.html">http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/07/10/28442.html</a> <br>

</p><p class="line874">I currently have it installed in R 2.4.0, but couldn't get it to work in 2.5.1. </p><p class="line862">Download from: <br>
<a class="http" href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html">CRAN (non-windows only)</a><br>
<a class="http" href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/bin/windows/contrib/2.6/">Brian Ripley, windows versions</a> </p><p class="line874">RMySQL allows you to access MySQL databases from within R.  </p><p class="line874">Why would you want to do this? </p><p class="line874">Because writing SQL queries is intuitive and powerful. And a database is a good place for information that you want to access in different, flexible ways. </p><p class="line867">
</p><h2>RMySQL Examples</h2>
<p class="line874">This is actually how I most often use RMySQL, just to slurp in a whole database table at once. I do this because I like storing information in databases so it is easy to access from R, perl, php, or within mysql itself - Once a data set is in the database, I don't have to worry about parsing a file anytime I want to look at it, I just grab it from the database without worry about delimiters or column order. </p><p class="line867"></p><pre>library(DBI)

res&lt;-dbSendQuery(con, "select * from yeast_genes_07")
genes&lt;- fetch(res, n = -1)
</pre><p class="line874">You can do whatever mysql query you want, though. You can grab only the parts of the table you're interested in based on different column values. </p><pre>res&lt;-dbSendQuery(con, "select * from yeast_genes_07 where description like \"%phosphatase%\"")

</p><h2>Earl's RODBC notes</h2>
<p class="line867"></p><pre>DO NOT USE RODBC with Excel files unless the data are quite regular - no holes.  


Any character fields mixed with numeric fileds are likely to be changed to NAs.    

First row of Excel spreadsheet MUST have column headings.

[http://www.omegahat.org/RDCOMClient/ RDCOMClient] is a package you can alternatively use to connect to an excel file, but it's not SQL-based. You can also save an excel file as text, tab delimited and then read it into R with the read.table command.
