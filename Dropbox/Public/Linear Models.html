<p>If there is a variable 
<span class='R'>x
</span> that is believed to hold a linear relationship 
with another variable 
<span class='R'>y
</span>, then a linear model may be useful. The model will take the form

<pre class='Rbr'>y
<sub>i
</sub> = ax
<sub>i
</sub> + b + e
<sub>i
</sub>
</pre>

<p>It is easier to think of the model without the 
<span class='R'>e
<sub>i
</sub>
</span>, which is just 
the residual of data point 
<span class='R'>i
</span> (some may call this the 'error').
So, the goal is the find the best fitting line to the data.
</p>

<p>As discussed in lab, this best linear model (by many standards) and the most commonly used
method is called the 'least squares regression line' and it has some
special properties: 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the sum of the residuals is zero, and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the point (mean(x), mean(y)) falls on the line.

using the function

<p>The number corresponding to the y-intercept is the number below

<span class='R'>(Intercept)
</span>. The second value that falls below

corresponds to the coefficient of 
<span class='R'>x
</span> (the slope in the equation). 
To put this into the form of an equation, use the form 'y=mx+b':
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = 1.659*x + 15.610
<br />
To get more information from 
<span class='R'>fit

<h3>
<a id='pred-resid'>
</a>finding predictors and residuals
</h3>

<p>Continuing on with the example above, it's time to put the model fit to use. Given the model,
if we want to look at what the predicted value of one of our x's would be, say at 12, what do
we do? To find this, we just use our least squares fit and plug 12 into the equation:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y-predicted = 1.659*12 + 15.610 = 35.518
<br />
So when x=12, we expect y to be about 35.518. This could be computed in R rather than
using a calculator.
The way I constructed 
<span class='R'>x
</span> in R, the position in 
<span class='R'>x
</span>
corresponding to the value 12 is the 22nd position, so I could the following in R:
</p>

<pre class='Rbr'>> 1.659*x[22] + 15.610
[1] 35.518
</pre>

<p>To check my answer in R, I could also use 
<span class='R'>fit
</span>, which stores extra 
information including predicted values:

<pre class='Rbr'>> fit$fitted[22]
      12 
35.51623 
</pre>

<p>The reason why the answers are slightly different is due to round off error in the
intercept and slope of the values in the R output (R rounded to 4 decimal places in
the output of 
<span class='R'>fit
</span> and 
<span class='R'>summary(fit)
</span>).
The output from 
<span class='R'>fit$fitted[12]
</span> is more precise.
</p>

<p>If we are interested in the predicted value, odds are we also have interest in the residual
at the given point. To compute the residual of a point, we use 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residual = observed - predicted
<br />
So, in the case for when x=12 with a predicted value of 35.52 (and an observed value of 38.54, which is
shown by the red dot in the plot),
the residual would be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38.54 - 35.52 = 3.02
<br />
As with the pedicted, R will save the residuals in 
<span class='R'>fit
</span>, and the residuals
may be extracted using

<pre class='Rbr'>> fit$resid[22]
      12 
3.021535 
</pre>

<p>As before, the manually computed and R-output may differ slightly, which is again due to
round-off error in the values of the model fit.
</p>


<p>One last remark. If a residual is positive, then we know the observed value was larger
than the predicted. If a residual is negative, then we know the observed value was
smaller than the predicted. This follows directly from the equation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residual = observed - predicted
</p>


<p>[[ Stat M12 students: be certain to understand how to do the manual computations of 
the predicted value and residuals from the output of 
<span class='R'>fit
</span> and

<span class='R'>summary(fit)
</span>. Use 
<span class='R'>fit$fitted
</span> and 

<span class='R'>fit$resid
</span> only as a method to check your answers. ]]

<h3>
<a id='diagnostics'>
</a>regression diagnostics
</h3>

<p> The plots below are the first two diagnostic plots available in R by plotting

<span class='R'>fit
</span>:
</p>

<pre class='Rbr'>> plot(fit)
</pre>

<p>
<img src='images/lm_diag1.png' />
</p>

<p>To view the plots, hit 'return'. The first plot gives an idea of whether there is any curvature in the data. If the red 
line is strongly curved, a quadratic or other model may be better. In this case, the curvature is 
not strong (so a quadratic component in the model is not necessary). The second plot
is to check whether the residuals are normally distributed. 
(Stat M12 students, don't worry about this.) 
<!-- For this example, there appears to be 
too much deviation from a straight line at the upper values for these to be normally distributed. 
This was confirmed using a more formal test on the residuals:
</p>

<pre class='Rbr'>> shapiro.test(fit$resid)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  fit$resid 
W = 0.9394, p-value = 0.01275
</pre> -->

<p>
<img src='images/lm_diag2.png' />
</p>

<p>The third plot is used to check if the variance is contant (ie, if the standard deviation among
the residuals appears to be about constant). If the red line is strongly tilted up/down, that is a 
red flag. There are no issues with that in this example - the variance appears constant. (The red 
line will always move up/down a little because of inherent randomness.) The last 
plot is used to check to see if there were any overly influential points (Stat M12 students, don't
worry about this plot at all). 
<!-- The more points move away 
from the cluster of the other points, the more influential they were. Because no points are very 
far away from the cluster, none should be too influential.  -->

<h3>
<a id='CI'>
</a>confidence intervals
</h3>

<p>Given a linear model, a confidence interval may be easily obtained by using the function

<span class='R'>confint()
</span>:

<pre class='Rbr'>> confint(fit)
               2.5 %    97.5 %
(Intercept) 4.149683 27.070573
x           1.267703  2.049981
</pre>

<p>
To change the level of confidence, add in the 
<span class='R'>level
</span> argument:

<pre class='Rbr'>> confint(fit, level=0.9)
                 5 %      95 %
(Intercept) 6.050094 25.170162
x           1.332563  1.985121
> confint(fit, level=0.99)
                0.5 %    99.5 %
(Intercept) 0.3217958 30.898460
x           1.1370588  2.180625
</pre>
