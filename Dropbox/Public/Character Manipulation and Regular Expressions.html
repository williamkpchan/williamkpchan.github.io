1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with Characters</h2>
As you probably noticed when looking at the above functions, they are very simple,
and, quite frankly, it's hard to see how they could really do anything complex on their
own.  In fact, that's just the point of these functions - they can be combined together
to do just about anything you would want to do.  As an example, consider the task of 
capitalizing the first character of each word in a string.  The <tt>toupper</tt> function
can change the case of <em>all</em> the characters in a string, but we'll need to do something
to separate out the characters so we can get the first one.  If we call <tt>strsplit</tt>
with an empty string for the splitting character, we'll get back a vector of the individual
characters:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;str&nbsp;=&nbsp;'sherlock&nbsp;holmes'
&#62;&nbsp;letters&nbsp;=&nbsp;strsplit(str,'')
&#62;&nbsp;letters
[[1]]
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;"h"&nbsp;"e"&nbsp;"r"&nbsp;"l"&nbsp;"o"&nbsp;"c"&nbsp;"k"&nbsp;"&nbsp;"&nbsp;"h"&nbsp;"o"&nbsp;"l"&nbsp;"m"&nbsp;"e"&nbsp;"s"
&#62;&nbsp;theletters&nbsp;=&nbsp;letters[[1]]

</pre>
 Notice that <tt>strsplit</tt> always returns a list.   This will be very
useful later, but for now we'll  extract the first element before
we try to work with its output.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The places that we'll need to capitalize things are the first position in the vector
or letters, and any letter that comes after a blank.  We can find those positions
very easily:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;wh&nbsp;=&nbsp;c(1,which(theletters&nbsp;==&nbsp;'&nbsp;')&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)
&#62;&nbsp;wh
[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;10

</pre>
 We can change the case of the letters whose indexes are in <tt>wh</tt>,
then use <tt>paste</tt> to put the string back together.

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;theletters[wh]&nbsp;=&nbsp;toupper(theletters[wh])
&#62;&nbsp;paste(theletters,collapse='')
[1]&nbsp;"Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes"

</pre>
 Things have gotten complicated enough that we could probably stand to 
write a function:

<pre>
maketitle&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(txt){
&nbsp;&nbsp;theletters&nbsp;=&nbsp;strsplit(txt,'')[[1]]
&nbsp;&nbsp;wh&nbsp;=&nbsp;c(1,which(theletters&nbsp;&nbsp;==&nbsp;'&nbsp;')&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;theletters[wh]&nbsp;=&nbsp;toupper(theletters[wh])
&nbsp;&nbsp;paste(theletters,collapse='')
}

</pre>
 Of course, we should always test our functions:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;maketitle('some&nbsp;crazy&nbsp;title')
[1]&nbsp;"Some&nbsp;Crazy&nbsp;Title"

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now suppose we have a vector of strings:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;titls&nbsp;=&nbsp;c('sherlock&nbsp;holmes','avatar','book&nbsp;of&nbsp;eli','up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;air')

</pre>
 We can always hope that we'll get the right answer if we just use
our function:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;maketitle(titls)
[1]&nbsp;"Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes"

</pre>
 Unfortunately, it didn't work in this case.  Whenever that happens,
<tt>sapply</tt> will operate on all the elements in the vector:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;sapply(titls,maketitle)
&nbsp;&nbsp;sherlock&nbsp;holmes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avatar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book&nbsp;of&nbsp;eli&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;air&nbsp;
"Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avatar"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book&nbsp;Of&nbsp;Eli"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up&nbsp;In&nbsp;The&nbsp;Air"&nbsp;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course, this isn't the only way to solve the problem.  Rather than break
up the string into individual letters, we can break it up into words, and 
capitalize the first letter of each, then combine them back together.  Let's
explore that approach:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;str&nbsp;=&nbsp;'sherlock&nbsp;holmes'
&#62;&nbsp;words&nbsp;=&nbsp;strsplit(str,'&nbsp;')
&#62;&nbsp;words
[[1]]
[1]&nbsp;"sherlock"&nbsp;"holmes"&nbsp;&nbsp;

</pre>
 Now we can use the assignment form of the <tt>substring</tt> 
function to change the first letter of each word to a capital.  Note that
we have to make sure to actually return the modified string from our call
to <tt>sapply</tt>, so we insure that the last statement in our function 
returns the string:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;sapply(words[[1]],function(w){substring(w,1,1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;toupper(substring(w,1,1));w})
&nbsp;&nbsp;sherlock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holmes&nbsp;
"Sherlock"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holmes"&nbsp;

</pre>
Now we can <tt>paste</tt> the pieces back together to get our answer:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;res&nbsp;=&nbsp;sapply(words[[1]],function(w){substring(w,1,1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;toupper(substring(w,1,1));w})
&#62;&nbsp;paste(res,collapse='&nbsp;')
[1]&nbsp;"Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes"

</pre>
  To operate on a vector of strings, we'll need to incorporate 
these steps into a function, and then call <tt>sapply</tt>:

<pre>
mktitl&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(str){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words&nbsp;=&nbsp;strsplit(str,'&nbsp;')
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;res&nbsp;=&nbsp;sapply(words[[1]],function(w){substring(w,1,1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;toupper(substring(w,1,1));w})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paste(res,collapse='&nbsp;')
}

</pre>
 We can test the function, making sure to use a string different than
the one we used in our initial test:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;mktitl('some&nbsp;silly&nbsp;string')
[1]&nbsp;"Some&nbsp;Silly&nbsp;String"

</pre>
 And now we can test it on the vector of strings:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;titls&nbsp;=&nbsp;c('sherlock&nbsp;holmes','avatar','book&nbsp;of&nbsp;eli','up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;air')
&#62;&nbsp;sapply(titls,mktitl)
&nbsp;&nbsp;sherlock&nbsp;holmes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avatar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book&nbsp;of&nbsp;eli&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;air&nbsp;
"Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avatar"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book&nbsp;Of&nbsp;Eli"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up&nbsp;In&nbsp;The&nbsp;Air"&nbsp;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How can we compare the two methods?  The R function <tt>system.time</tt> will
report the amount of time any operation in R uses.  One important caveat - 
if you wish to assign an expression to a value in the <tt>system.time</tt>
call, you must use the "<tt>&lt;-</tt>" assignment operator, because the 
equal sign will confuse the function into thinking you're specifying a 
named parameter in the function call.  Let's try <tt>system.time</tt> on
our two functions:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(one&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;sapply(titls,maketitle))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.001&nbsp;
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(two&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;sapply(titls,mktitl))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.002&nbsp;

</pre>
 For such a tiny example, we can't really trust that the difference
we see is real.   Let's use the movie names from a previous example:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;movies&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.delim('http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/movies.txt',
+&nbsp;sep='|',stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
&#62;&nbsp;nms&nbsp;=&nbsp;tolower(movies$name)
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(one&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;sapply(nms,maketitle))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.045&nbsp;
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(two&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;sapply(nms,mktitl))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.258&nbsp;

</pre>
 It looks like the first method is better than the second.  Of 
course, if they don't get the same answer, it doesn't really matter how
fast they are.  In R, the <tt>all.equal</tt> function can be used to 
see if things are the same:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;all.equal(one,two)
[1]&nbsp;TRUE

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular Expressions</h2>
Regular expressions are a method of describing patterns in text that's
far more flexible than using ordinary character strings.  While an 
ordinary text string is only matched by an exact copy of the string, 
regular expressions give us the ability to describe what we want in more
general terms.  For example, while we couldn't search for email addresses
in a text file using normal searches (unless we knew every possible email
address), we can describe the general form of an email address (some characters
followed by an "<tt>@</tt>" sign,  followed by some more characters, a period,
and a few more characters.
through regular expressions,
and then find all the email addresses in the document very easily.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another handy feature of regular expressions is that we can "tag" parts of 
an expression for extraction.  If you  look at the HTML source of a web
page (for example, by using View-&#62;Source in a browser, or using 
<tt>download.file</tt> in R to make a local copy), you'll notice that all
the clickable links are represented by HTML like:

<pre>
&lt;a&nbsp;href="http://someurl.com/somewhere"&#62;

</pre>
It would be easy to search for the string <tt>href=</tt> to find the links,
but what if some webmasters used something like

<pre>
&lt;a&nbsp;href&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;'http://someurl.com/somewhere'&#62;

</pre>
  Now a search for <tt>href=</tt> won't help us, but it's easy to
express those sorts of choices using regular expressions. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are a lot of different versions of regular expressions in the world of
computers, and while they share the same basic concepts and much of the 
same syntax, there are irritating differences among the different versions.
If you're looking for additional information about regular expressions in
books or on the web, you should know that, in addition to basic regular
expresssions, recent versions of R also support perl-style regular expressions.
(perl is a scripting language whose
creator, Larry Wall, developed some attractive extensions to the basic
regular expression syntax.)  Some of the rules of regular expressions are 
laid out in very terse language on the R help page for <tt>regex</tt> and 
<tt>regexpr</tt>. Since regular
expressions are a somewhat challenging topic, there are many valuable resources
on the internet.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Before we start, one word of caution.  We'll see that the way that regular
expressions work is that they take many of the common punctuation symbols and
give them special meanings.  Because of this, when you want to refer to one 
of these symbols literally (that is, as simply a character like other characters),
you need to precede those symbols with a backslash (<tt>\</tt>).  But backslashes
already have a special meaning in character strings;  they are used to indicate
control characters, like tab (<tt>\t</tt>), and newline (<tt>\n</tt>).  The upshot
of this is that when you want to type a backslash to keep R from misinterpreting
certain symbols, you need to precede it with <em>two</em> backslashes in the 
input.   By the way, the characters for which this needs to be done are:

<pre>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;^&nbsp;$&nbsp;+&nbsp;?&nbsp;*&nbsp;(&nbsp;)&nbsp;[&nbsp;]&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;|&nbsp;\

</pre>
To reiterate, when any of these characters is to be interpreted literally in
a regular expression, they must be preceded by two backslashes when they are
passed to functions in R.   If you're not sure, it's almost always safe to
add a backslash (by typing two backslashes) in front of a character - if 
it's not needed, it will be
ignored.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Regular expressions are constructed from three different components: 
literal characters, which will only be matched by the identical literal
character, character classes, which are matched by more than one characters,
and modifiers which operate on characters, character classes, or combinations
of the two.  A character class consists of an opening square bracket (<tt>[</tt>),
one or more characters, and a closing square bracket (<tt>]</tt>), and is 
matched by any of the characters between the brackets.  If the first character
inside the brackets is the caret (<tt>^</tt>), then the character class is 
matched by anything <em>except</em> the other characters between the brackets.
Ranges are allowed in character classes and one of the most important examples
is <tt>[0-9]</tt>, a character class matched by any of the digits from 0 to 9.
Other ranges of characters include <tt>[a-z]</tt>, all the lower case letters,
and <tt>[A-Z]</tt>, all the uppercase letters.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are also some shortcuts for certain character classes that you may
or may not find useful.  They're summarized in the following table.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<a name="tth_tAb1">
</a> 
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center">Symbol</td><td>Matches</td><td align="center">Symbol</td><td>Matches</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">\w</td><td>Alphanumerics and _</td><td align="center">\W</td><td>Non-alphanumerics</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">\d</td><td>Digits</td><td align="center">\D</td><td>Non-digits</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">\s</td><td>Whitespace</td><td align="center">\S</td><td>Non-whitespace</td></tr></table>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
Like other cases in R where backslashes need to be interpreted literally,
we have to include two backslashes to use the above shortcuts.
