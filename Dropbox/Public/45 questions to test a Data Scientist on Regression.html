<strong>Q1. Which of the following step / assumption in regression modeling impacts the trade-off between under-fitting and over-fitting the most.
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. The polynomial degree
</p>

<p>B. Whether we learn the weights by matrix inversion or gradient descent
</p>

<p>C. The use of a constant-term
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Choosing the right degree of polynomial plays a critical role in fit of regression. If we choose higher degree of polynomial, chances of overfit increase significantly.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q2. Suppose you have the following data with one real-value input variable &amp; one real-value output variable. What is leave-one out cross validation mean square error in case of linear regression (Y = bX+c)?
</strong>
</p>

<p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-31195 size-full" src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Regression.png" width="332" height="85" srcset="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Regression.png 332w, https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Regression-300x77.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" />
</p>

<p>A. 10/27
</p>

<p>B. 20/27
</p>

<p>C. 50/27
</p>

<p>D. 49/27
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: D
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We need to calculate the residuals for each cross validation point. After fitting the line with 2 points and leaving 1 point for cross validation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-31201 size-full" src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/q3.png" width="351" height="244" srcset="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/q3.png 351w, https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/q3-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" />
</p>

<p>Leave one out cross validation mean square error = (2^2 +(2/3)^2 +1^2) /3 = 49/27
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q3. Which of the following is/ are true about  “Maximum Likelihood estimate (MLE)”?
</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>MLE may not always exist
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>MLE always exists
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>If MLE exist, it (they) may not be unique
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>If MLE exist, it (they) must be unique

</li>

</ol>

<p>A. 1 and 4
</p>

<p>B. 2 and 3
</p>

<p>C. 1 and 3
</p>

<p>D. 2 and 4
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p>The MLE may not be a turning point i.e. may not be a point at which the first derivative of the likelihood (and log-likelihood) function vanishes.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q4. Let’s say, a “Linear regression” model perfectly fits the training data (train error is zero). Now, Which of the following statement is true?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. You will always have test error zero
</p>

<p>B. You can not have test error zero
</p>

<p>C. None of the above
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Test error may be zero if there no noise in test data. In other words, it will be zero, if the test data is perfect representative of train data but not always.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q5. In a linear regression problem, we are using “R-squared” to measure goodness-of-fit. We add a feature in linear regression model and retrain the same model.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Which of the following option is true?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. If R Squared increases, this variable is significant.
</p>

<p>B. If R Squared decreases, this variable is not significant.
</p>

<p>C. Individually R squared cannot tell about variable importance. We can&#8217;t say anything about it right now.
</p>

<p>D. None of these.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“R squared” individually can’t tell whether a variable is significant or not because each time when we add a feature, “R squared” can either increase or stay constant. But, it is not true in case of “Adjusted R squared” (increases when features found to be significant).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q6. Which one of the statement is true regarding residuals in regression analysis?
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">A. Mean of residuals is always zero
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">B. Mean of residuals is always less than zero
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">C. Mean of residuals is always greater than zero
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">D. There is no such rule for residuals.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p>Sum of residual in regression is always zero. It the sum of residuals is zero, the &#8216;Mean&#8217; will also be zero.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q7. Which of the one is true about Heteroskedasticity?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. Linear Regression with varying error terms
</p>

<p>B. Linear Regression with constant error terms
</p>

<p>C. Linear Regression with zero error terms
</p>

<p>D. None of these
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The presence of non-constant variance in the error terms results in heteroskedasticity. Generally, non-constant variance arises because of presence of outliers or extreme leverage values.
</p>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q8. Which of the following indicates a fairly strong relationship between X and Y?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. Correlation coefficient = 0.9
</p>

<p>B. The p-value for the null hypothesis Beta coefficient =0 is 0.0001
</p>

<p>C. The t-statistic for the null hypothesis Beta coefficient=0 is 30
</p>

<p>D. None of these
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Correlation between variables is 0.9. It signifies that the relationship between variables is fairly strong.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, p-value and t-statistics merely measure how strong is the evidence that there is non zero association. Even a weak effect can be extremely significant given enough data.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q9. Which of the following assumptions do we make while deriving linear regression parameters?
</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>The true relationship between dependent y and predictor x is linear
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>The model errors are statistically independent
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>The errors are normally distributed with a 0 mean and constant standard deviation
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>The predictor x is non-stochastic and is measured error-free
</strong>
</li>

</ol>

<p>A. 1,2 and 3.
</p>

<p>B. 1,3 and 4.
</p>

<p>C. 1 and 3.
</p>

<p>D. All of above.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: D
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">When deriving regression parameters, we make all the four assumptions mentioned above. If any of the assumptions is violated, the model would be misleading.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q10. To test linear relationship of y(dependent) and x(independent) continuous variables, which of the following plot best suited?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. Scatter plot
</p>

<p>B. Barchart
</p>

<p>C. Histograms
</p>

<p>D. None of these
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">To test the linear relationship between continuous variables Scatter plot is a good option. We can find out how one variable is changing w.r.t. another variable. A scatter plot displays the relationship between two quantitative variables.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q11. Generally, which of the following method(s) is used for predicting continuous dependent variable?
</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Linear Regression
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Logistic Regression
</strong>
</li>

</ol>

<p>A. 1 and 2
</p>

<p>B. only 1
</p>

<p>C. only 2
</p>

<p>D. None of these.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: B
</strong>
</p>

<p>Logistic Regression is used for classification problems. Regression term is misleading here.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q12.  A correlation between age and health of a person found to be -1.09.  On the basis of this you would tell the doctors that:
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. The age is good predictor of health
</p>

<p>B. The age is poor predictor of health
</p>

<p>C. None of these
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p>Correlation coefficient range is between [-1 ,1]. So -1.09 is not possible.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q13. Which of the following offsets, do we use in case of least square line fit? Suppose horizontal axis is independent variable and vertical axis is dependent variable.
</strong>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-31205 size-full" src="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/q13.png" width="448" height="237" srcset="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/q13.png 448w, https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/q13-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" />
</p>

<p>A. Vertical offset
</p>

<p>B. Perpendicular offset
</p>

<p>C. Both but depend on situation
</p>

<p>D. None of above
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p>We always consider residual as vertical offsets. Perpendicular offset are useful in case of PCA.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q14. Suppose we have generated the data with help of polynomial regression of degree 3 (degree 3 will perfectly fit this data). Now consider below points and choose the option based on these points.
</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Simple Linear regression will have high bias and low variance
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Simple Linear regression will have low bias and high variance
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>polynomial of degree 3 will have low bias and high variance
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Polynomial of degree 3 will have low bias and Low variance
</strong>
</li>

</ol>

<p>A. Only 1
</p>

<p>B. 1 and 3
</p>

<p>C. 1 and 4
</p>

<p>D. 2 and 4
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p>If we fit higher degree polynomial greater than 3, it will overfit the data because model will become more complex. If we fit the lower degree polynomial less than 3 which means that we have less complex model so in this case high bias and low variance. But in case of degree 3 polynomial it will have low bias and low variance.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q15. Suppose you are training a linear regression model. Now consider these points.
</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Overfitting is more likely if we have less data
</strong>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small
</strong>
</li>

</ol>

<p>Which of the above statement(s) are correct?
</p>

<p>A. Both are False
</p>

<p>B. 1 is False and 2 is True
</p>

<p>C. 1 is True and 2 is False
</p>

<p>D. Both are True
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">1.With small training dataset, it’s easier to find a hypothesis to fit the training data exactly i.e. overfitting.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">2. We can see this from the bias-variance trade-off. When hypothesis space is small, it has higher bias and lower variance. So with a small hypothesis space, it’s less likely to find a hypothesis to fit the data exactly i.e. underfitting.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q16. Suppose we fit “Lasso Regression” to a data set, which has 100 features (X1,X2&#8230;X100).  Now, we rescale one of these feature by multiplying with 10 (say that feature is X1),  and then refit Lasso regression with the same regularization parameter.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Now, which of the following option will be correct?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. It is more likely for X1 to be excluded from the model
</p>

<p>B. It is more likely for X1 to be included in the model
</p>

<p>C. Can&#8217;t say
</p>

<p>D. None of these
</p>

<p>Solution: B
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Big feature values =⇒ smaller coefficients =⇒ less lasso penalty =⇒ more likely to have be kept
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q17. Which of the following is true about “Ridge” or “Lasso” regression methods in case of feature selection?
</strong>
</p>

<p>A. Ridge regression uses subset selection of features
</p>

<p>B. Lasso regression uses subset selection of features
</p>

<p>C. Both use subset selection of features
</p>

<p>D. None of above
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: B
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“Ridge regression” will use all predictors in final model whereas “Lasso regression” can be used for feature selection because coefficient values can be zero. For more detail

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Q18. Which of the following statement(s) can be true post adding a variable in a linear regression model?
</strong>
</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify">

<li>
<strong>R-Squared and Adjusted R-squared both increase
</strong>
</li>

</ol>

<ol style="text-align: justify" start="2">

<li>
<strong>R-Squared increases and Adjusted R-squared decreases

<p>A. 1 and 2
</p>

<p>B. 1 and 3
</p>

<p>C. 2 and 4
</p>

<p>D. None of the above
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Each time when you add a feature, R squared always either increase or stays constant, but it is not true in case of Adjusted R squared. If it increases, the feature would be significant.
</p>

</p>

<ol>

<li style="text-align: justify">
<strong>The training error in first model is higher when compared to second and third model.
</strong>
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify">
<strong>The best model for this regression problem is the last (third) model, because it has minimum training error.
</strong>
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify">
<strong>The second model is more robust than first and third because it will perform better on unseen data.
</strong>
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify">
<strong>The third model is overfitting data as compared to first and second model.
</strong>
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify">
<strong>All models will perform same because we have not seen the test data.
</strong>
</li>

</ol>

<p>A. 1 and 3
</p>

<p>B. 1 and 3
</p>

<p>C. 1, 3 and 4
</p>

<p>D. Only 5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Solution: C
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The trend of the data looks like a quadratic trend over independent variable X. A higher degree (Right graph) polynomial might have a very high accuracy on the train population but is expected to fail badly on test dataset. But if you see in left graph we will have training error maximum because it under-fits the training data.

<strong>Solution: A
</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In particular, if we have very few observations and it&#8217;s small, then our models can rapidly overfits data.
