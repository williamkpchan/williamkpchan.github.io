<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Programming is an integral part of data science. <br>
Among other things, it is acknowledged that a person who understands programming logic, loops and functions has a higher chance of becoming a successful data scientist. <br>
But, what about those folks who never studied programming in their school or college days?</p>

<p><span>Is there no way for them to become a data scientist then?</span></p>

<p><span>With the recent boom in data science, a lot of people are interested in getting into this domain. <br>
but don't have the slightest idea about coding. <br>
In fact, I too was a member of your non-programming league until I joined my first job. <br>
Therefore, I understand how terrible it feels when something you have never learned haunts you at every step.</span></p>


<p>The good news is that there is a way for you to become a data scientist, regardless of your programming skills! There are tools that typically obviate the programming aspect and provide user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) so that anyone with minimal knowledge of 
<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/common-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">algorithms</a> can simply use them to build high quality machine learning models.</p>

<p>Many companies (especially startups) have recently launched GUI driven data science tools. <br>
I have tried to cover a few important ones in this article and provided videos as well, wherever possible.</p>

<p>

<p>RapidMiner (RM) was originally started in 2006 as an open-source stand-alone software named Rapid-I. <br>
Over the years, they have given it the name of RapidMiner and also attained ~35Mn USD in funding. <br>
The tool is open-source for old version (below v6) but the latest versions come in a 14-day trial period and licensed after that.</p>

<p>RM covers the entire life-cycle of prediction modeling, starting from data preparation to model building and finally validation and deployment. <br>
The GUI is based on a block-diagram approach, something very similar to Matlab Simulink. <br>
There are predefined blocks which act as plug and play devices. <br>
You just have to connect them in the right manner and a large variety of algorithms can be run without a single line of code. <br>
On top of this, they allow custom R and Python scripts to be integrated into the system.</p>

<p>There current product offerings include the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>RapidMiner Studio</strong>: A stand-alone software which can be used for data preparation, visualization and statistical modeling</li>

<h3>End Notes</h3>

<p>In this article, we have discussed various initiatives working towards automating various aspects of solving a data science problem. <br>
Some of them are in a nascent research stage, some are open-source and others are already being used in the industry with millions in funding. <br>
All of these pose a potential threat to the job of a data scientist, which is expected to grow in the near future. <br>
These tools are best suited for people who are not familiar with programming &amp; coding.</p>
