<h1>Drawing Tablets</h1>
<p>This page is about drawing tablets, what they are, how they work, and
where things can go wrong.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-are-tablets">
<h2>What are tablets?</h2>
<p>Drawing with a mouse can be unintuitive and difficult compared to pencil
and paper. Even worse, extended mouse use can result in carpal tunnel
syndrome. That’s why most people who draw digitally use a specialized
piece of hardware known as a drawing tablet.</p>

<img alt="../_images/Krita_tablet_types.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_tablet_types.png" />
<p>A drawing tablet is a piece of hardware that you can plug into your
machine, much like a keyboard or mouse. It usually looks like a plastic
pad, with a stylus. Another popular format is a computer monitors with
stylus used to draw directly on the screen. These are better to use than
a mouse because it’s more natural to draw with a stylus and generally
better for your wrists.</p>
<p>With a properly installed tablet stylus, Krita can use information like
pressure sensitivity, allowing you to make strokes that get bigger or
smaller depending on the pressure you put on them, to create richer and
more interesting strokes.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Sometimes, people confuse finger-touch styluses with a proper tablet. You can tell the difference because a drawing tablet stylus usually has a pointy nib, while a stylus made for finger-touch has a big rubbery round nib, like a finger. These tablets may not give good results and a pressure-sensitive tablet is recommended.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Krita_tablet_stylus.png" class="last" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_tablet_stylus.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drivers-and-pressure-sensitivity">
<h2>Drivers and Pressure Sensitivity</h2>
<p>So you have bought a tablet, a real drawing tablet. And you wanna get it
to work with Krita! So you plug in the USB cable, start up Krita and…
It doesn’t work! Or well, you can make strokes, but that pressure
sensitivity you heard so much about doesn’t seem to work.</p>
<p>This is because you need to install a program called a ‘driver’. Usually
you can find the driver on a CD that was delivered alongside your
tablet, or on the website of the manufacturer. Go install it, and while
you wait, we’ll go into the details of what it is!</p>
<p>Running on your computer is a basic system doing all the tricky bits of
running a computer for you. This is the operating system, or OS. Most
people use an operating system called Windows, but people on an Apple
device have an operating system called MacOS, and some people, including
many of the developers use a system called Linux.</p>
<p>The base principle of all of these systems is the same though. You would
like to run programs like Krita, called software, on your computer, and
you want Krita to be able to communicate with the hardware, like your
drawing tablet. But to have those two communicate can be really
difficult - so the operating system, works as a glue between the two.</p>
<p>Whenever you start Krita, Krita will first make connections with the
operating system, so it can ask it for a lot of these things: It would
like to display things, and use the memory, and so on. Most importantly,
it would like to get information from the tablet!</p>
<img alt="../_images/Krita_tablet_drivermissing.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_tablet_drivermissing.png" />
<p>But it can’t! Turns out your operating system doesn’t know much about
tablets. That’s what drivers are for. Installing a driver gives the
operating system enough information so the OS can provide Krita with the
right information about the tablet. The hardware manufacturer’s job is
to write a proper driver for each operating system.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Because drivers modify the operating system a little, you will always need to restart your computer when installing or deinstalling a driver, so don’t forget to do this! Conversely, because Krita isn’t a driver, you don’t need to even deinstall it to reset the configuration, just rename or delete the configuration file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-it-can-go-wrong">
<h2>Where it can go wrong</h2>
<p>Krita automatically connects to your tablet if the drivers are
installed. When things go wrong, usually the problem isn’t with Krita.</p>
<div class="section" id="surface-pro-tablets-need-two-drivers">
<h3>Surface pro tablets need two drivers</h3>
<p>Certain tablets using n-trig, like the Surface Pro, have two types of
drivers. N-trig by default only has Windows Ink drivers, but Krita
requires Wintab-style drivers. It is recommended to install both versions. See
the FAQ for more info on this.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Since 3.3, Krita can use windows ink style drivers too, just go to <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Configure Krita ‣ Tablet Settings</span> and toggle the “Windows 8+ pointer input” there.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="windows-10-updates">
<h3>Windows 10 updates</h3>
<p>Sometimes a Windows 10 update can mess up tablet drivers. In that case,
reinstalling the drivers should work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="broken-drivers">
<h3>Broken Drivers</h3>
<p>Tablet drivers need to be made by the manufacturer. Sometimes, with
really cheap tablets, the hardware is fine, but the driver is badly
written, which means that the driver just doesn’t work well. We cannot
do anything about this, sadly. You will have to send a complaint to the
manufacturer for this, or buy a better tablet with better quality
drivers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conflicting-drivers">
<h3>Conflicting Drivers</h3>
<p>On Windows, you can only have a single wintab-style driver installed at
a time. So be sure to deinstall the previous driver before installing
the one that comes with the tablet you want to use. Other operating
systems are a bit better about this, but even Linux, where the drivers
are often preinstalled, cant run two tablets with different drivers at
once.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interfering-software">
<h3>Interfering software</h3>
<p>Sometimes, there’s software that tries to make a security layer between
Krita and the operating system. Sandboxie is an example of this.
However, Krita cannot always connect to certain parts of the operating
system while sandboxed, so it will often break in programs like
sandboxie. Similarly, certain mouse software, like Razer utilities can
also affect whether Krita can talk to the operating system, converting
tablet information to mouse information. This type of software should be
configured to leave Krita alone, or be deinstalled.</p>
<p>The following software has been reported to interfere with tablet events
to Krita:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Sandboxie</li>
<li>Razer mouse utilities</li>
<li>AMD catalyst “game mode” (this broke the right click for someone)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flicks-wait-circle-showing-up-and-then-calling-the-popup-palette">
<h3>Flicks (Wait circle showing up and then calling the popup palette)</h3>
<p>If you have a situation where trying to draw keeps bringing up the
pop-up palette on windows, then the problem might be flicks. These are a
type of gesture, a bit of windows functionality that allows you to make
a motion to serve as a keyboard shortcut. Windows automatically turns
these on when you install tablet drivers, because the people who made
this part of windows forgot that people also draw with computers. So you
will need to turn it off in the windows flicks configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wacom-double-click-sensitivity-straight-starts-of-lines">
<h3>Wacom Double Click Sensitivity (Straight starts of lines)</h3>
<p>If you experience an issue where the start of the stroke is straight,
and have a wacom tablet, it could be caused by the Wacom driver
double-click detection.</p>
<p>To fix this, go to the Wacom settings utility and lower the double click
sensitivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supported-tablets">
<h2>Supported Tablets</h2>
<p>Supported tablets are the ones of which Krita developers have a version
themselves, so they can reliably fix bugs with them. <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/list_supported_tablets.html#list-supported-tablets"><span class="std std-ref">We maintain a list of those here</span></a>.</p>
</div>

            
  <div class="section" id="loading-and-saving-brushes">
<span id="loading-saving-brushes"></span><span id="index-0"></span>
<br><br><br><br>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Loading and Saving Brushes</h1>
<p>In the real world, when painting or drawing, you don’t just use one
tool. You use pencils, erasers, paintbrushes, different types of paint,
inks, crayons, etcetera. All these have different ways of making marks.</p>
<p>In a digital program like Krita you have something similar. We call this
a brush engine. And much like how cars have different engines that give
different feels when driving, or how pencils make distinctly different
marks than rollerbal pens, different brush engines have totally
different feels.</p>
<p>The brush engines have a lot of different settings as well. So, you can
save those settings into presets.</p>
<p>Unlike Photoshop, Krita makes a difference between brush-tips and
brush-presets. Tips are only a stamp of sorts, while the preset uses a
tip and many other settings to create the full brush.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-brush-settings-dropdown">
<h2>The Brush settings dropdown</h2>
<p>To start, the Brush Settings Editor panel can be accessed in the
toolbar, between the Blending Modes button on the right and the Patterns
button on the left. Alternately, you can use the function key f5 to open
it.</p>
<p>When you open Brush Settings Editor panel you will see something like
this:</p>
<div class="section" id="tour-of-the-brush-settings-dropdown">
<h3>Tour of the brush settings dropdown</h3>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Krita_4_0_Brush_Settings_Layout.svg"><img alt="../_images/Krita_4_0_Brush_Settings_Layout.svg" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_4_0_Brush_Settings_Layout.svg" width="800" /></a>
<p>The brush settings drop down is divided into six areas,</p>
<div class="section" id="section-a-general-information">
<h4>Section A - General Information</h4>
<p>This contains the <strong>Preset Icon</strong>, <strong>Live Brush Preview</strong>, the <strong>Preset
Name</strong>, the <strong>Engine</strong> name, and several buttons for saving, renaming,
and reloading.</p>
<p>Krita’s brush settings are stored into the metadata of a 200x200
png(The KPP file), where the image in the png file becomes the preset
icon. This icon is used everywhere in Krita, and is useful for
differentiating brushes in ways that the live preview cannot.</p>
<p>The live preview shows a stroke of the current brush as a little s-curve
wiggle, with the pressure being non-existent on the left, and increasing to
full pressure as it goes to the right. It can thus show the effect of the
Pressure, Drawing Angle, Distance, Fade and Fuzzy Dab sensors, but none of the
others. For some brush engines it cannot show anything. For the color smudge,
filter brush and clone tool, it shows an alternating line pattern because these
brush engines use the pixels already on canvas to change their effect.</p>
<p>After the preset name, there’s a button for <strong>renaming</strong> the brush. This
will save the brush as a new brush and blacklist the previous name.</p>
<div class="section" id="engine">
<h5>Engine</h5>
<p>The engine of a brush is the underlying programming that generates the
stroke from a brush. What that means is that different brush engines
have different options and different results. You can see this as the
difference between using crayons, pencils and inks, but because
computers are maths devices, most of our brush engines produce different
things in a more mathematical way.</p>
<p>For most artists the mathematical nature doesn’t matter as much as the
different textures and marks each brush engine, and each brush engine
has its own distinct flavor and use, and can be further customized by
modifying the options.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reloading">
<h5>Reloading</h5>
<p>If you change a preset, an icon will appear behind the engine name. This
is the <span class="guilabel">reload</span> button. You can use it to revert to the original brush
settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-a-preset">
<h5>Saving a preset.</h5>
<p>On the right, there’s <span class="guilabel">Save New Preset</span> and <span class="guilabel">Overwrite Preset</span>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Overwrite Preset</dt>
<dd>This will only enable if there are any changes. Pressing this will
override the current preset with the new settings, keeping the name
and the icon intact. It will always make a timestamped back up in
the resources folder.</dd>
<dt>Save New Preset</dt>
<dd>Will take the current preset and all its changes and save it as a
new preset. If no change was made, you will be making a copy of the
current preset.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Save new preset will call up the following window, with a mini scratch
pad, and all sorts of options to change the preset icon:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Krita_4_0_Save_New_Brush_Preset_Dialog.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_4_0_Save_New_Brush_Preset_Dialog.png" />
<p>The image on the left is a mini scratchpad, you can draw on it with the
current brush, allowing small modifications on the fly.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Brush Name</dt>
<dd>The Name of your brush. This is also used for the KPP file. If
there’s already a brush with that name, it will effectively
overwrite it.</dd>
<dt>Load Existing Thumbnail</dt>
<dd>This will load the existing thumbnail inside the preset.</dd>
<dt>Load scratch pad thumbnail</dt>
<dd>This will load the dashed area from the big scratch pad(Section C)
into the thumbnail area.</dd>
<dt>Load Image</dt>
<dd>With this you can choose an image from disk to load as a thumbnail.</dd>
<dt>Load from Icon Library</dt>
<dd>This opens up the icon library.</dd>
<dt>Clear Thumbnail</dt>
<dd>This will make the mini scratch pad white.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-icon-library">
<h5>The Icon Library</h5>
<p>To make making presets icons faster, Krita got an icon library.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Krita_4_0_Preset_Icon_Library_Dialog.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_4_0_Preset_Icon_Library_Dialog.png" />
<p>It allows you to select tool icons, and an optional small emblem. When
you press OK it will load the resulting combination into the mini
scratch pad and you can draw in the stroke.</p>
<p>If you go to your resources folder(), there’s a folder there called
“preset_icons”, and in this folder there are “tool_icons” and
“emblem_icons”. You can add semi-transparent pngs here and Krita will
load those into the icon library as well so you can customize your icons
even more!</p>
<p>At the top right of the icon library, there are three sliders. They allow
you to adjust the tool icon. The top two are the same Hue and Saturation
as in HSL adjustment, ad the lowest slider is a super simple levels
filter. This is done this way because the levels filter allows
maintaining the darkest shadows and brightest highlights on a tool icon,
making it much better for quick adjustments.</p>
<p>If you’re done with everything, you can press save in the Save New
Preset dialog and Krita will save the new brush.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-b-the-preset-chooser">
<h4>Section B - The Preset Chooser</h4>
<p>The preset chooser is much the same as the preset docker and the
preset dropdown on F6. It’s unique in that it allows you to filter by
engine and this is also where you can create brushes for an engine from
scratch.</p>
<p>It is by default collapsed, so you will need to press the arrow at the
top left of the brush engine to show it.</p>
<p>The top drop down is set to “all” by default, which means it shows all
engines. It then shows a tag section where you can select the tags, the
preset list and the search bar.</p>
<p>Underneath that there’s a plus icon, which when pressed gives you the
full list of Krita’s engines. Selecting an engine from the list will for
that engine.</p>
<p>The trashcan icon does the same as it does in the preset docker: delete , or
rather, blacklist a preset so it won’t show up in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-c-the-scratch-pad">
<h4>Section C - The Scratch pad</h4>
<p>When you tweak your brushes, you want to be able to check what each
setting does. That’s why, to the right of the settings drop down, there
is a scratch pad.</p>
<p>It is by default collapsed, so you will have to press the arrow at the
top right of the brush settings to show it.</p>
<p>When saving a new preset, you can choose to get the icon from the
scratch pad, this will load the dash area into the mini scratch pad of
the Save New Preset dialog.</p>
<p>The scratch pad has five buttons underneath it. These are in order for:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Showing the current brush image</li>
<li>Adding a gradient to the scratch pad(useful for smudge brushes)</li>
<li>Filling with the background color</li>
<li>Clearing everything on the scratch pad.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-d-the-options-list">
<h4>Section D - The Options List</h4>
<p>The options, as stated above, are different per brush engine. These
represent the different parameters, toggles and knobs that you can turn
to make a brush preset unique. For a couple of options, the main things
to change are sliders and check boxes, but for a lot of them, they use
curves instead.</p>
<p>Some options can be toggled, as noted by the little check boxes next to
them, but others, like flow and opacity are so fundamental to how the
brush works, that they are always on.</p>
<p>The little padlock icon next to the options is for locking the brush.
This has its own page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-e-option-configuration-widget">
<h4>Section E - Option Configuration Widget</h4>
<p>Where section D is the list of options, section E is the widget where
you can change things.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-sensor-curves">
<h5>Using sensor curves</h5>
<p>One of the big important things that makes art unique to the artist who
created it is the style of the strokes. Strokes are different because
they differ in speed, rotation, direction, and the amount of pressure
put onto the stylus. Because these are so important, we would want to
customize how these values are understood in detail. The best way to do
this is to use curves.</p>
<p>Curves show up with the size widget for example. With an inking brush,
we want to have size mapped to pressure. Just toggling the size option
in the option list will do that.</p>
<p>However, different people have different wrists and thus will press
differently on their stylus. Someone who presses softly tends to find it
easy to make thin strokes, but very difficult to make thick strokes.
Conversely, someone who presses hard on their stylus naturally will have
a hard time making thin strokes, but easily makes thick ones.</p>
<p>Such a situation can be improved by using the curves to map pressure to
output thinner lines or thicker ones.</p>
<p>The brush settings curves even have quick curve buttons for these at the
top. Someone who has a hard time making small strokes should try the
second to last concave button, while someone who has a hard time making
thick strokes should try the third button, the S shape.</p>
<p>Underneath the curve widget there’s two more options:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Share Curves across all settings</dt>
<dd>This is for the list of sensors. Toggling this will make all the
sensors use the same curve. Unchecked, all checked sensors will have
separate curves.</dd>
<dt>Curves Calculation Mode</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This indicates how the multiple values of the sensor curves are
used. The curves always go from 0 to 1.0, so if one curve outputs
0.5 and the other 0.7, then…</p>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>Multiply</dt>
<dd>Will multiply the two values, 0.5*0.7 = 0.35</dd>
<dt>Addition</dt>
<dd>Will add the two to a maximum of 1.0, so 0.5+0.7 = 1.2,
which is then capped at 1.0.</dd>
<dt>Maximum</dt>
<dd>Will compare the two and pick the largest. So in the case of 0.5
and 0.7, the result is 0.7.</dd>
<dt>Minimum</dt>
<dd>Will compare the two and pick the smallest. So in the case of
0.5 and 0.7, the result is 0.5.</dd>
<dt>Difference</dt>
<dd>Will subtract the smallest value from the largest, so 0.7-0.5 =
0.2</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It’s maybe better to see with the following example:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Krita_4_0_brush_curve_calculation_mode.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_4_0_brush_curve_calculation_mode.png" />
<p>The first two are regular, the rest with different multiplication types.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Is a brush with size set to the distance sensor.</li>
<li>Is a brush with the size set to the fade sensor.</li>
<li>The size is calculated from the fade and distance sensors multiplied.</li>
<li>The size is calculated from the fade and distance sensors added to
each other. Notice how thick it is.</li>
<li>The size takes the maximum value from the values of the fade and
distance sensors.</li>
<li>The size takes the minimum value from the values of the face and
distance sensors.</li>
<li>The size is calculated by having the largest of the values subtracted
with the smallest of the values.</li>

<h2>Making a Brush Preset</h2>
<p>Now, let’s make a simple brush to test the waters with:</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-a-default-for-the-brush-engine">
<h3>Getting a default for the brush engine.</h3>
<p>First, open the settings with F5.</p>
<p>Then, press the arrow on the upper left to open the preset chooser.
There, press the “+” icon to get a list of engines. For this brush we’re
gonna make a pixel brush.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-making-an-inking-brush">
<h3>Example: Making an inking brush</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Draw on the scratch pad to see what the current brush looks like. If
done correctly, you should have a 5px wide brush that has pressure set
to opacity.</li>
<li>Let us turn off the opacity first. Click on the
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/brushes/brush_settings/opacity_and_flow.html#option-opacity-n-flow"><span class="std std-ref">opacity</span></a>
option in the right-hand list. The settings should now be changed to
a big curve. This is the sensor curve.</li>
<li>Uncheck the <span class="guilabel">enable pen settings</span> checkbox.</li>
<li>Test on the scratch pad… there still seems to be something
affecting opacity. This is due the
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/brushes/brush_settings/opacity_and_flow.html#option-opacity-n-flow"><span class="std std-ref">flow</span></a>
option.</li>
<li>Select the Flow option from the list on the right hand. Flow is like
Opacity, except that Flow is per dab, and opacity is per stroke.</li>
<li>Uncheck the <span class="guilabel">enable pen settings</span> checkbox here as well. Test again.</li>
<li>Now you should be getting somewhere towards an inking brush. It is
still too small however, and kinda grainy looking. Click <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/brushes/brush_settings/brush_tips.html#option-brush-tip"><span class="std std-ref">Brush Tip</span></a> in the
brush engine options.</li>
<li>Here, diameter is the size of the brush-tip. You can touch the slider
change the size, or right-click it and type in a value. Set it to 25
and test again. It should be much better.</li>
<li>Now to make the brush feel a bit softer, turn down the fade parameter
to about 0.9. This’ll give the <em>brush mask</em> a softer edge.</li>
<li>If you test again, you’ll notice the fade doesn’t seem to have much
effect. This has to do with the spacing of the dabs: The closer they
are together, the harder the line is. By default, this is 0.1, which
is a bit low. If you set it to 10 and test, you’ll see what kind of
effect spacing has. The
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/brushes/brush_settings/options.html#option-spacing"><span class="std std-ref">Auto</span></a>
checkbox changes the way the spacing is calculated, and Auto Spacing
with a value of 0.8 is the best value for inking brushes. Don’t
forget that you can use right-click to type in a value.</li>
<li>Now, when you test, the fade seems to have a normal effect… except
on the really small sizes, which look pixelly. To get rid of that,
check the anti-aliasing check box. If you test again, the lines should
be much nicer now.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-the-new-brush">
<h3>Saving the new Brush</h3>
<p>When you’re satisfied, go to the upper left and select “save new
preset”.</p>
<p>You will get the save preset dialog. Name the brush something like “My
Preset”. Then, select “Load from Icon Library” to get the icon library.
Choose a nice tool icon and press OK.</p>
<p>The icon will be loaded into the mini scratch pad on the left. Now
doodle a nice stroke next to it. If you feel you messed up, just go back
to the icon library to load a new icon.</p>
<p>Finally press “save”, and your brush should be done.</p>
<p>You can further modify your inking brush by…</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Changing the amount of pressure you need to put on a brush to make it full size.</dt>
<dd>To do this, select the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/brushes/brush_settings/options.html#option-size"><span class="std std-ref">size</span></a>
option, and press the pressure sensor from the list next to the curve. The curve should look like a straight line. Now if you want a brush that gets big with little pressure, tick on the curve to make a point, and drag the point to the upper-left. The more the point is to the upper-left, the more extreme the effect. If you want instead a brush that you have to press really hard on to get to full size, drag the dot to the lower-right. Such a brush is useful for fine details. Don’t forget to save the changes to your brush when done.</dd>
<dt>Making the fine lines look even softer by using the flow option.</dt>
<dd>To do this, select the flow option, and turn back on the enable pen settings check box. Now if you test this, it is indeed a bit softer, but maybe a bit too much. Click on the curve to make a dot, and drag that dot to the top-left, half-way the horizontal of the first square of the grid. Now, if you test, the thin lines are much softer, but the hard your press, the harder the brush becomes.</dd>

<div class="section" id="sharing-brushes">
<h2>Sharing Brushes</h2>
<p>Okay, so you’ve made a new brush and want to share it. There are several
ways to share a brush preset.</p>
<p>The recommended way to share brushes and presets is by using the
resource bundle system. We have detailed instructions on how to use them
on the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/resource_management.html#resource-management"><span class="std std-ref">resource management page</span></a>.</p>
<p>However, there’s various old-fashioned ways of sharing brushes that can
be useful when importing and loading very old packs:</p>
<div class="section" id="sharing-a-single-preset">
<h3>Sharing a single preset</h3>
<p>There are three types of resources a single preset can take:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A Paintoppreset file: This is the preset proper, with the icon and
the curves stored inside.</li>
<li>A Brush file: This is the brush tip. When using masked brushes,
there’s two of these.</li>
<li>A Pattern file: this is when you are using textures.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when you have a brush that uses unique predefined tips for either
brush tip or masked brush, or unique textures you will need to share
those resources as well with the other person.</p>
<p>To find those resources, go to <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Manage Resources ‣ Open Resource Folder</span>.</p>
<p>There, the preset file will be inside paintoppresets, the brush tips
inside brushes and the texture inside patterns.</p>
<div class="section" id="importing-a-single-kpp-file">
<h4>Importing a single KPP file.</h4>
<p>Now, if you want to use the single preset, you should go to the preset
chooser on f6 and press the folder icon there. This will give a file
dialog. Navigate to the kpp file and open it to import it.</p>
<p>If there’s brush tips and patterns coming with the file, do the same
with pattern via the pattern docker, and for the brush-tip go to the
settings dropdown(f5) and then go to the “brush-tip” option. There,
select predefined brush, and then the “import” button to call up the
file dialog.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharing-via-zip-old-fashioned">
<h3>Sharing via ZIP(old-fashioned)</h3>
<p>Sharing via ZIP should be replaced with resource bundles, but older
brush packs are stored in zip files.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-a-zip-with-the-relevant-files">
<h4>Using a ZIP with the relevant files.</h4>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Manage Resources ‣ Open Resource Folder</span> to open the resource folder.</li>
<li>Then, open up the zip file.</li>
<li>Copy the brushes, paintoppresets and patterns folders from the zip
file to the resource folder. You should get a prompt to merge the
folders, agree to this.</li>
<li>Restart Krita</li>
<li>Enjoy your brushes!</li>

<h1>On-Canvas Brush Editor</h1>
<p>Krita’s brush editor is, as you may know, on F5. However, sometimes you
just want to modify a single parameter quickly. Perhaps even in
canvas-only mode. The on canvas brush editor or brush HUD allows you to
do this. It’s accessible from the pop-up palette, by ticking the
lower-right arrow button.</p>
<img alt="../_images/On_canvas_brush_editor.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/On_canvas_brush_editor.png" />
<p>You can change the amount of visible settings and their order by
clicking the settings icon next to the brush name.</p>
<img alt="../_images/On_canvas_brush_editor_2.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/On_canvas_brush_editor_2.png" />
<p>On the left are all unused settings, on the right are all used settings.
You use the and buttons to move a setting between the two columns. The
and buttons allow you to adjust the order of the used settings, for when
you think flow is more important than size.</p>
<img alt="../_images/On_canvas_brush_editor_3.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/On_canvas_brush_editor_3.png" />
<p>These set-ups are PER brush engine, so different brush engines can have
different configurations.</p>

<p>Mirror Tools give a similar result to the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/tools/multibrush.html#multibrush-tool"><span class="std std-ref">Multibrush Tool</span></a>, but unlike the Multibrush which only traces brush strokes like the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/tools/freehand_brush.html#freehand-brush-tool"><span class="std std-ref">Freehand Brush Tool</span></a>, the Mirror Tools can be used with any other tool that traces strokes, such as the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/tools/line.html#line-tool"><span class="std std-ref">Straight Line Tool</span></a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/tools/path.html#path-tool"><span class="std std-ref">Bezier Curve Tool</span></a>, and even with the Multibrush Tool.</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal Mirror Tool</strong> - Mirror the
results along the horizontal axis.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Mirror Tool</strong> - Mirror the
results along the vertical axis.</p>
<p>There are additional options for each tool. You can access these by the

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Krita’s vanishing point assistants in action</span></p>
</div>
<p>The following assistants are available in Krita:</p>
<div class="section" id="types">
<h2>Types:</h2>
<p>There’s several types in Krita. You can select a type of assistant via
the tool options docker.</p>
<div class="section" id="ellipse">
<span id="assistant-ellipse"></span><h3>Ellipse</h3>
<p>An assistant for drawing ellipses and circles.</p>
<p>This assistant consists of three points: the first two are the axis of
the ellipse, and the last one is to determine its width.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Concentric Ellipse</dt>
<dd>The same an ellipse, but allows for making ellipses that are
concentric to each other.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you press shift while holding the first two handles, they will snap
to perfectly horizontal or vertical lines. Press Shift while holding the
third handle, and it’ll snap to a perfect circle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="perspective">
<span id="assistant-perspective"></span><h3>Perspective</h3>
<p>This ruler takes four points and creates a perspective grid.</p>
<p>This grid can be used with the ‘perspective’ sensor, which can influence
brushes.</p>
<p>If you press shift while holding any of the corner handles, they’ll snap
to one of the other corner handles, in sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ruler">
<span id="assistant-ruler"></span><h3>Ruler</h3>
<p>There are three assistants in this group:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Ruler</dt>
<dd>Helps create a straight line between two points.</dd>
<dt>Infinite Ruler</dt>
<dd>Extrapolates a straight line beyond the two visible points on the
canvas.</dd>
<dt>Parallel Ruler</dt>
<dd>This ruler allows you to draw a line parallel to the line between
the two points anywhere on the canvas.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you press shift while holding the first two handles, they will snap
to perfectly horizontal or vertical lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spline">
<span id="assistant-spline"></span><h3>Spline</h3>
<p>This assistant allows you to position and adjust four points to create a
cubic bezier curve. You can then draw along the curve, snapping your
brush stroke directly to the curve line. Perfect curves every time!</p>
<p>If you press shift while holding the first two handles, they will snap
to perfectly horizontal or vertical lines. Press shift while holding the
third or fourth handle, they will snap relative to the handle they are
attached to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vanishing-point">
<span id="assistant-vanishing-point"></span><h3>Vanishing Point</h3>
<p>This assistant allows you to create a vanishing point, typically used
for a horizon line. A preview line is drawn and all your snapped lines are drawn to this line.</p>
<p>It is one point, with four helper points to align it to previously
created perspective lines.</p>
<p>They are made and manipulated with the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/tools/assistant.html#assistant-tool"><span class="std std-ref">Assistant Tool</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you press shift while holding the center handle, they will snap to
perfectly horizontal or vertical lines depending on the position of
where it previously was.</p>
<div class="versionchanged">
<p><span class="versionmodified">Changed in version 4.1: </span>The vanishing point assistant also shows several general lines.</p>
<p>When you’ve just created, or when you’ve just moved a vanishing point assistant, it will be selected. This means you can modify the amount of lines shown in the tool options of the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/tools/assistant.html#assistant-tool"><span class="std std-ref">Assistant Tool</span></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fish-eye-point">
<span id="assistant-fish-eye"></span><h3>Fish Eye Point</h3>
<p>Like the vanishing point assistant, this assistant is per a set of
parallel lines in a 3d space. So to use it effectively, use two, where
the second is at a 90 degree angle of the first, and add a vanishing
point to the center of both. Or combine one with a parallel ruler and a
vanishing point, or even one with two vanishing points. The
possibilities are quite large.</p>
<p>This assistant will not just give feedback/snapping between the
vanishing points, but also give feedback to the relative left and right
of the assistant. This is so you can use it in edge-cases like panoramas
with relative ease.</p>
<p>If you press shift while holding the first two handles, they will snap
to perfectly horizontal or vertical lines. Press shift while holding the
third handle, and it’ll snap to a perfect circle.</p>

<h3>Orthographic</h3>
<p>Orthographic is a mode where you try to look at something from the left
or the front. Typically, you try to keep everything in exact scale with
each other, unlike perspective deformation.</p>
<p>The key assistant you want to use here is the Parallel
Ruler. You can set these up horizontally or vertically, so
you always have access to a Grid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="axonometric">
<h3>Axonometric</h3>
<p>All of these are set up using three Parallel Rulers.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Dimetric &amp; Isometric</dt>
<dd>Isometric perspective has technically all three rulers set up at
120° from each other. Except when it’s game isometric, then it’s a

assistants to a grid.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="logic-of-the-vanishing-point">
<h3>Logic of the vanishing point</h3>
<p>There’s a little secret that perspective tutorials don’t always tell you, and that’s that a vanishing point is the point where any two parallel lines meet. This means that a 1 point perspective and 2 point perspective are virtually the same.</p>
<p>We can prove this via a little experiment. That good old problem: drawing a rail-road.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Assistants_vanishing_point_logic_01.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Assistants_vanishing_point_logic_01.png" />
<p>You are probably familiar
with the problem: How to determine where the next beam is going to be, as perspective projection will make them look closer together.</p>
<p>Typically, the solution is to draw a line in the middle and then draw lines diagonally across. After all, those lines are parallel, meaning that the exact same distance is used.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Assistants_vanishing_point_logic_02.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Assistants_vanishing_point_logic_02.png" />
<p>But because they are parallel, we can use a vanishing point assistant instead, and we use the alignment handles to align it to the diagonal of the beam, and to the
horizontal (here marked with red).</p>
<p>That diagonal can then in turn be used to determine the position of the
beams:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Assistants_vanishing_point_logic_03.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Assistants_vanishing_point_logic_03.png" />
<p>Because any given set of lines has a vanishing point(outside of the ones flat on the view-plane), there can be an infinite amount of vanishing points in a linear perspective. Therefore, Krita allows you to set vanishing points yourself instead of forcing you to only use a few.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fish-eye-perspective">
<h3>Fish Eye perspective</h3>
<p>Fish eye perspective works much the same as the linear perspective, the
big difference being that in a fish-eye perspective, any parallel set of
lines has two vanishing points, each for one side.</p>
<p>So, to set them up, the easiest way is one horizontal, one vertical, on
the same spot, and one vanishing point assistant in the middle.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Fish-eye.gif" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Fish-eye.gif" />
<p>But, you can also make one horizontal one that is just as big as the
other horizontal one, and put it halfway:</p>

<h1>Working with Images</h1>
<p>Computers work with files and as a painting program, Krita works with
images as the type of file it creates and manipulates.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-do-images-contain">
<h2>What do Images Contain?</h2>
<p>If you have a text document, it of course contains letters, strung in
the right order, so the computer loads them as coherent sentences.</p>
<div class="section" id="raster-data">
<h3>Raster Data</h3>
<p>This is the main data on the paint layers you make. So these are the
strokes with the paint brush and look pixely up close. A multi-layer
file will contain several of such layers, that get overlaid on top of
each other so make the final image.</p>
<p>A single layer file will usually only contain raster data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vector-data">
<h3>Vector Data</h3>
<p>These are mathematical operations that tell the computer to draw pixels
on a spot. This makes them much more scalable, because you just tell the
operation to make the coordinates 4 times bigger to scale it up. Due to
this vector data is much more editable, lighter, but at the same time
it’s also much more CPU intensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="operation-data">
<h3>Operation Data</h3>
<p>Stuff like the filter layers, that tells Krita to change the colors of a
layer, but also transparency masks, group layer and transformation masks
are saved to multi-layer files. Being able to load these depend on the
software that initially made the file. So Krita can load and save
groups, transparency masks and layer effects from PSD, but not load or
save transform masks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metadata">
<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>Metadata is information like the creation date, author, description and
also information like DPI.</p>

<div class="section" id="image-size">
<h2>Image size</h2>
<p>The image size is the dimension and resolution of the canvas. Image size
has direct effect file size of the Krita document. The more pixels that
need to be remembered and the higher the bit depth of the color, the
heavier the resulting file will be.</p>
<div class="section" id="dpi-ppi">
<h3>DPI/PPI</h3>
<p><strong>DPI</strong> stands for <em>Dots per Inch</em>, <strong>PPI</strong> stands for <em>Pixels per
Inch</em>. In printing industry, suppose if your printer prints at 300
<strong>DPI</strong> It means it is actually putting 300 dots of colors in an area
equal to an Inch. This means the number of pixels your artwork has in a
relative area of an Inch.</p>
<p><strong>DPI</strong> is the concern of the printer, and artists while creating
artwork should keep <strong>PPI</strong> in mind. According to the <strong>PPI</strong> you have
set, the printers can decide how large your image should be on a piece
of paper.</p>
<p>Some standards:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>72 PPI</dt>
<dd>This is the default PPI of monitors as assumed by all programs. It
is not fully correct, as most monitors these days have 125 PPI or
even 300 PPI for the retina devices. None the less, when making an
image for computer consumption, this is the default.</dd>
<dt>120 PPI</dt>
<dd>This is often used as standard for low-quality posters.</dd>
<dt>300 PPI</dt>
<dd>This is the minimum you should use for quality prints.</dd>
<dt>600 PPI</dt>
<dd>The quality used for line art for comics.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="color-depth">
<h3>Color depth</h3>
<p>We went over color depth in the Color Management page. What you need to
understand is that Krita has image color spaces, and layer color spaces,
the latter which can save memory if used right. For example, having a
line art layer in grayscale can half the memory costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="image-color-space-vs-layer-color-space-vs-conversion">
<h3>Image color space vs layer color space vs conversion.</h3>
<p>Because there’s a difference between image color space and layer color
space, you can change only the image color space in <span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Properties</span> which will leave the layers alone. But if you want to change the color
space of the file including all the layers you can do it by going to
Image &gt; Convert Image Color Space this will convert all the layers Color space as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="author-and-description">
<h2>Author and Description</h2>
<img alt="../_images/document_information_screen.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/document_information_screen.png" />
<p>Krita will automatically save who created the image into your image’s
metadata. Along with the other data such as time and date of creation
and modification, Krita also shows editing time of a document in the
document information dialog, useful for professional illustrators,
speed-painters to keep track of the time they worked on an artwork for
billing purposes. It detects when you haven’t performed actions for a
while, and has a precision of +- 60 seconds. You can empty it in the
document info dialog and of course by unzipping you .kra file and
editing the meta-data there.</p>
<p>These things can be edited in <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Document Information</span>, and for the author’s information <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Configure Krita ‣ Author Information</span>. Profiles can be switched under <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Active Author Profile</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="setting-the-canvas-background-color">
<h3>Setting the canvas background color</h3>
<p>You can set the canvas background color via <span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Image Background
color and Transparency</span>. This allows you to turn the background color
non-transparent and to change the color. This is also useful for certain file
formats which force a background color instead of transparency. PNG and
JPG export use this color as the default color to fill in transparency
if you do not want to export transparency.</p>
<p>If you come in from a program like <strong class="program">Paint Tool Sai</strong>, then using this
option, or using <span class="guilabel">Set Canvas Background Color</span> in the new file options,
will allow you to work in a slightly more comfortable environment, where
transparency isn’t depicted with checkered boxes.</p>

<h2>Cropping and resizing the canvas</h2>
<p>You can crop and image with the

<div class="section" id="trimming">
<h3>Trimming</h3>
<p>Using <span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Trim to Layer</span>, Krita resizes the image to the dimensions
of the layer selected. Useful for when you paste a too large image into
the layer and want to resize the canvas to the extent of this layer.</p>
<p><span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Trim to Selection</span> is a faster cousin to the crop tool, This helps
us to resize the canvas to the dimension of any active selection. This
is especially useful with right clicking the layer on the layer stack
and choosing Select Opaque. <span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Trim to Selection</span> will then crop the
canvas to the selection bounding box.</p>
<p><span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Trim to Image Size</span> is actually for layers, and will trim all
layers to the size of the image, making your files lighter by getting
rid of invisible data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resizing-the-canvas">
<h2>Resizing the canvas</h2>
<p>You can also resize the canvas via <span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Resize Canvas`(or :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt +

<img alt="../_images/Resize_Canvas.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Resize_Canvas.png" />
<p>In this, constraint proportions will make sure the height and width stay
in proportion to each other as you change them. Offset makes indicates
where the new canvas space is added around the current image. You
basically decide where the current image goes(if you press the
left-button, it’ll go to the center left, and the new canvas space will
be added to the right of the image).</p>
<p>Another way to resize the canvas according to the need while drawing is
when you scroll away from the end of the canvas, you can see an arrow
appear. Clicking this will extend the canvas in that direction. You can
see the arrow marked in red in the example below</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Infinite-canvas.png"><img alt="../_images/Infinite-canvas.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Infinite-canvas.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
<div class="section" id="resizing-the-image">
<h3>Resizing the image</h3>
<p><span class="guilabel">Scale Image to New Size</span> allows you to resize the whole image. Also,
importantly, this is where you can change the resolution or <em>upres</em> your
image. So for instance, if you were initially working at 72 PPI to block
in large shapes and colors, images, etc… And now you want to really get
in and do some detail work at 300 or 400 PPI this is where you would make
the change.</p>
<p>Like all other dialogs where a chain link appears, when the chain is
linked the aspect ratio is maintained. To disconnect the chain, just click
on the links and the two halves will separate.</p>

<p>This is useful for people working in print, or people manipulating game
textures. There’s no combine functionality, but what you can do, if
using colored output, is to set two of the channels to the addition

<div class="section" id="saving-exporting-and-opening-files">
<h2>Saving, Exporting and Opening Files</h2>
<p>When Krita creates or opens a file, it has a copy of the file in memory,
that it edits. This is part of the way how computers work: They make a
copy of their file in the ram. Thus, when saving, Krita takes it’s copy
and copies it over the existing file. There’s a couple of tricks you can
do with saving.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Save</dt>
<dd>Krita saves the current image in its memory to a defined place on
the hard-drive. If the image hadn’t been saved before, Krita will
ask you where to save it.</dd>
<dt>Save As</dt>
<dd>Make a copy of your current file by saving it with a different name.
Krita will switch to the newly made file as its active document.</dd>
<dt>Open</dt>
<dd>Open a saved file. Fairly straightforward.</dd>
<dt>Export</dt>
<dd>Save a file to a new location without actively opening it. Useful
for when you are working on a layered file, but only need to save a
flattened version of it to a certain location.</dd>
<dt>Open Existing Document As Untitled Document</dt>
<dd>This is a bit of an odd one, but it opens a file, and forgets where
you saved it to, so that when pressing ‘save’ it asks you where to
save it. This is also called ‘import’ in other programs.</dd>
<dt>Create Copy from Current Image</dt>
<dd>Makes a new copy of the current image. Similar to Open Existing
Document As Untitled Document, but then with already opened files.</dd>
<dt>Save Incremental Version</dt>
<dd>Saves the current image as ‘filename’_XXX.kra and switches the
current document to it.</dd>
<dt>Save Incremental Backup.</dt>
<dd>Exports the current image as ‘filename’_XXX.kra.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Since Krita’s file format is compressed data file, in case of corrupt or broken file you can open it with archive managers and extract the contents of the layers.

<h1></h1>
<h1>Introduction to Layers and Masks</h1>
<p>Krita supports layers which help to better control parts and elements of
your painting.</p>
<p>Think of an artwork or collage made with various stacks of papers with
some paper cut such that they show the paper beneath them while some
hide what’s beneath them. If you want to replace an element in the
artwork, you replace that piece of paper instead of drawing the entire
thing. In Krita instead of papers we use <strong>Layers</strong>. Layers are part of
the document which may or may not be transparent, they may be smaller or
bigger than the document itself, they can arrange one above other, named
and grouped.</p>
<p>Layers can give better control over your artwork for example you can
re-color an entire artwork just by working on the separate color layer
and thereby not destroying the line art which will reside above this
color layer.</p>
<p>You can edit individual layers, you can even add special effects to
them, like Layer styles, blending modes, transparency, filters and
transforms. Krita takes all these layers in its layer stack, including
the special effects and combines or composites together a final image.
This is just one of the many digital image manipulation tricks that
<strong class="program">Krita</strong> has up its sleeve!</p>
<p>Usually, when you put one paint layer on top of another, the upper paint
layer will be fully visible, while the layer behind it will either be
obscured, occluded or only partially visible.</p>
<div class="section" id="managing-layers">
<h2>Managing layers</h2>
<p>Some artists draw with limited number of layers but some prefer to have
different elements of the artwork on separate layer. Krita has some good
layer management features which make the layer management task easy.</p>
<p>You can <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/layers_and_masks/group_layers.html#group-layers"><span class="std std-ref">group layers</span></a> and organise
the elements of your artwork.</p>
<p>The layer order can be changed or layers can be moved in and out of a
group in the layer stack by simply holding them and dragging and
dropping. Layers can also be copied across documents while in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/preferences/general_settings.html#window-settings"><span class="std std-ref">subwindow mode</span></a>, by
dragging and dropping from one document to another.</p>
<p>These features save time and also help artists in maintaining the file
with a layer stack which will be easy to understand for others who work
on the same file. In addition to these layers and groups can both be
labeled and filtered by colors, thus helping the artists to visually
differentiate them.</p>
<p>To assign a color label to your layer or layer group you have to right
click on the layer and choose one of the given colors from the context
menu. To remove an already existing color label you can click on the ‘x’
marked box in the context menu.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Layer-color-filters.png"><img alt="../_images/Layer-color-filters.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Layer-color-filters.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p>Once you assign color labels to your layers, you can then filter layers
having similar color label by clicking on one or more colors in the list
from the drop-down situated at the top-right corner of the layer docker</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Layer-color-filters-menu.png"><img alt="../_images/Layer-color-filters-menu.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Layer-color-filters-menu.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>

<h2>Types of Layers</h2>
<img alt="../_images/500px-Krita-types-of-layers.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/500px-Krita-types-of-layers.png" />
<p>The image above shows the various types of layers in <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/dockers/layers.html#layer-docker"><span class="std std-ref">Layers</span></a>, Each layer type has a different purpose for example all the vector elements can be only placed on a vector layer and similarly normal raster elements are mostly on the paint layer, <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/layers_and_masks.html#cat-layers-and-masks"><span class="std std-ref">Layers and Masks</span></a> page contains more information about these types layers.</p>
<p>Now Let us see how these layers are composited in Krita.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-are-layers-composited-in-krita">
<h2>How are layers composited in Krita ?</h2>
<p>In Krita, the visible layers form a composite image which is shown on
the canvas. The order in which Krita composites the layers is from
bottom to top, much like the stack of papers we discussed above. As we
continue adding layers, the image we see changes, according to the
properties of the newly added layers on top. Group Layers composite
separately from the other layers in the stack, except when pass through
mode is activated. The layers inside a group form a composite image
first and then this composite is taken into consideration while the
layer stack is composited to form a whole image. If the pass through
mode is activated by pressing the icon similar to bricked wall, the
layers within the group are considered as if they are outside of that
particular group in the layer stack, however, the visibility of the
layers in a group depends on the visibility of the group.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Passthrough-mode_.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Passthrough-mode_.png" />
<img alt="../_images/Layer-composite.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Layer-composite.png" />
<p>The groups in a PSD file saved from Photoshop have pass-through mode on
by default unless they are specifically set with other blending modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inherit-alpha-or-clipping-layers">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Inherit Alpha or Clipping layers</h2>
<p>There is a clipping feature in Krita called inherit alpha. It is denoted
by an alpha icon in the layer stack.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Inherit-alpha-02.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Inherit-alpha-02.png" />
<p>It can be somewhat hard to figure out how the inherit alpha feature
works in Krita for the first time. Once you click on the inherit alpha
icon on the layer stack, the pixels of the layer you are painting on are
confined to the combined pixel area of all the layers below it. That
means if you have the default white background layer as first layer,
clicking on the inherit alpha icon and painting on any layer above will
seem to have no effect as the entire canvas is filled with white. Hence,
it is advised to put the base layer that you want the pixels to clip in
a group layer. As mentioned above, group layers are composited
separately, hence the layer which is the lowest layer in a group becomes
the bounding layer and the content of the layers above this layer clips
to it if inherit alpha is enabled.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Inherit-alpha-krita.jpg" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Inherit-alpha-krita.jpg" />
<img alt="../_images/Krita-tutorial2-I.1-2.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita-tutorial2-I.1-2.png" />
<p>You can also enable alpha inheritance to a group layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="masks-and-filters">
<h2>Masks and Filters</h2>
<p>Krita supports non-destructive editing of the content of the layer.
Non-destructive editing means editing or changing a layer or image
without actually changing the original source image permanently, the
changes are just added as filters or masks over the original image while
keeping it intact, this helps a lot when your workflow requires constant
back and forth. You can go back to original image with a click of a
button, Just hide the filter or mask you have your initial image.</p>
<p>You can add various filters to a layer with Filter mask, or add Filter
layer which will affect the whole image. Layers can also be transformed non-destructively with the transformation masks, and even have portions temporarily hidden with a Transparenct Mask. Non-destructive effects like these are very useful when you change your mind later, or need to make a set of variations of an given image.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You can merge all visible layers by selecting everything first <span class="menuselection">Layer ‣ Select ‣ Visible Layers</span>. Then Combine them all by merging <span class="menuselection">Layer ‣ Merge with Layer Below</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>These filters and masks are accessible through the right click menu (as
shown in the image below) and the Plus icon on the layer docker.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Layer-right-click.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Layer-right-click.png" />
<p>You can also add a filter as a mask from filter dialog itself, by
clicking on the <span class="guilabel">Create Filter Mask</span> button.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Filtermask-button.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Filtermask-button.png" />
<p>All the filters and masks can also be applied over a group too, thus
making it easy to non-destructively edit multiple layers at once. In the
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/layers_and_masks.html#cat-layers-and-masks"><span class="std std-ref">category Layers and masks</span></a> you can read

<h2>Removing Selections</h2>
<p>If you want to delete the entire selection, the easiest way is to deselect everything. <span class="menuselection">Select ‣ Deselect</span>. Shortcut <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl + Shift + A</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="display-modes">
<h2>Display Modes</h2>
<p>In the bottom left-hand corner of the status bar there is a button to toggle how the selection is displayed. The two display modes are the following: (Marching) Ants and Mask. The red color with Mask can be changed in the preferences. You can edit the color under <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Configure Krita ‣ Display ‣ Selection Overlay</span>. If there is no selection,
this button will not do anything.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Ants-displayMode.jpg" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Ants-displayMode.jpg" />
<p>Ants display mode (default) is best if you want to see the areas that are not selected.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Mask-displayMode.jpg" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Mask-displayMode.jpg" />
<p>Mask display mode is good if you are interested in seeing the various transparency levels for your selection. For example, you can create a selection with a gradient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="global-selection-mask-painting-a-selection">
<h2>Global Selection Mask (Painting a Selection)</h2>
<p>The global Selection Mask is your selection that appears on the layers docker. By default, this is hidden, so you will need to make it visible via <span class="menuselection">Select ‣ Show Global Selection Mask</span>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Global-selection-mask.jpg" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Global-selection-mask.jpg" />
<p>Once the global Selection Mask is shown, you will need to create a
selection. The benefit of using this is that you can paint your
selection using any of the normal painting tools. The information is
saved as grayscale. You might want to switch to the Mask display mode if it is difficult to see the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selection-from-layer-transparency">
<h2>Selection from layer transparency</h2>
<p>You can create a selection based on a layer’s transparency by right-clicking on the layer in the layer docker and selecting “Select Opaque” from the context menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pixel-and-vector-selection-types">
<h2>Pixel and Vector Selection Types</h2>
<p>Vector selections allow you to modify your selection with vector anchor tools. Pixel selections allow you to modify selections with pixel information. They both have their benefits and disadvantages. You can convert one type of selection to another.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Vector-pixel-selections.jpg" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Vector-pixel-selections.jpg" />
<p>When creating a selection, you can select what type of selection you
want from the Mode in the selection tool options: Pixel or Vector.</p>
<p>Vector selections can modify as any other vector shape with the
“Shape Handle” tool, if you try to paint on a vector selection it will be converted into a pixel selection. Pixel selections can be painted with any tool. You can also convert vector shapes to selection. In turn, vector selections can be made from vector shapes, and vector shapes can be converted to vector selections using the options in the selections menu. Krita will add a new vector layer for this shape.</p>
<p>One of
the most common reasons to use vector selections is that they give you
the ability to move and transform a selection. Moving the selection with
a pixel selection will move the content on the layer. Moving the
selection on a vector selection will only move the selection. You can
also use the path editing tool to change the anchor points in the
selection</p>
<p>If you started with a pixel selection, you can still convert it to a
vector selection to get these benefits. Go to Select &gt; Convert to Vector
Selection.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

<h1>Tag Management</h1>
<p>Tags are how you organize common types of resources. They can be used with brushes, gradients, patterns, and even brush tips. You can select them from a drop-down menu above the resources. Selecting a tag will filter all the resources by that tag. Selecting the tag of “All” will show all resources.  Krita comes installed with a few default tags. You can create and edit your own as well. The tags are managed similarly across the different types of resources.</p>
<p>You can use tags together with the <a class="reference internal" href="getting_started/navigation.html#navigation"><span class="std std-ref">Pop-up Palette</span></a> for increased productivity.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Soft Proofing</h1>
<p>When we make an image in Krita, and print that out with a printer, the image tends to look different. The colours are darker, or less dark than expected, maybe the reds are more aggressive, maybe contrast is lost. For simple documents, this isn’t much of a problem, but for professional prints, this can be very sad, as it can change the look and feel of an image drastically.</p>
<p>The reason this happens is simply because the printer uses a different color model(CMYK) and it has often access to a lower range of colors(called a gamut).</p>
<p>A naive person would suggest the following solution: do your work within the CMYK color model! But there are three problems with that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Painting in a CMYK space doesn’t guarantee that the colors will be the same on your printer. For each combination of Ink, Paper and Printing device, the resulting gamut of colors you can use is different. Which means that each of these could have a different profile associated with them.</li>
<li>Furthermore, even if you have the profile and are working in the exact color space that your printer can output, the CMYK color space is very irregular, meaning that the color maths isn’t as nice as in other spaces. Blending modes are different in CMYK as well.</li>
<li>Finally, working in that specific CMYK space means that the image is stuck to that space. If you are preparing your work for  different a CMYK profile, due the paper, printer or ink being different, you might have a bigger gamut with more bright colors that you would like to take advantage of.</li>
</ul>
<p>So ideally, you would do the image in RGB, and use all your favorite RGB tools, and let the computer do a conversion to a given CMYK space on the fly, just for preview. This is possible, and is what we call ‘’Soft Proofing’‘.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2" style="width: 800px">
<img alt="../_images/Softproofing_regularsoftproof.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Softproofing_regularsoftproof.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">On the left, the original, on the right, a view where soft proofing is turned on. The difference is subtle due to the lack of really bright colors, but the soft proofed version is slightly less blueish in the whites of the flowers and slightly less saturated in the greens of the leaves.</span></p>
</div>
<p>You can toggle soft proofing on any image using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl + Y</kbd>. Unlike other programs, this is per-view, so that you can look at your image non-proofed and proofed, side by side. The settings are also per image, and saved into the .kra file. You can set the proofing options in <span class="menuselection">image ‣ image properties ‣ Soft Proofing</span>.</p>
<p>There you can set the following options:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Profile, Depth, Space</dt>
<dd>Of these, only the profile is really important. This will serve as the profile you are proofing to. In a professional print workflow, this profile should be determined by the printing house.</dd>
<dt>Intent</dt>

<dd>A feature which allows you to set whether <span class="guilabel">Absolute Colorimetric</span> will make the white in the image screen-white during proofing(The slider set to max), or whether it will use the white point of the profile(The slider set to minimum). Often CMYK profiles have a different white as the screen, or amongst one another due to the paper color being different.</dd>
<dt>Black Point Compensation</dt>
<dd>Set the black point compensation. Turning this off will crunch the shadow values to the minimum the screen and the proofing profile can handle, while turning this on will scale the black to the screen-range, showing you the full range of grays in the image.</dd>

<p>You can set the defaults that Krita uses in <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Configure Krita ‣ Color Management</span></p>
<p>To configure this properly, it’s recommended to make a test image to print(and that is printed by a properly set-up printer) and compare against, and then approximate in the proofing options how the image looks compared to the real-life copy you have made.</p>
<div class="section" id="out-of-gamut-warning">
<h2>Out of Gamut Warning</h2>
<p>The out of gamut warning, or gamut alarm, is an extra option on top of Soft-Proofing: It allows you to see which colors are being clipped, by replacing the resulting color with the set alarm color.</p>
<p>This can be useful to determine where certain contrasts are being lost, and to allow you to change it slowly to a less contrasted image.</p>

  <div class="section" id="vector-graphics">
<span id="index-0"></span><span id="id1"></span>
<br><br><br><br>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Vector Graphics</h1>
<p>Krita 4.0 has had a massive rewrite of the vector tools. So here’s a page explaining the vector tools:</p>
<div class="section" id="what-are-vector-graphics">
<h2>What are vector graphics?</h2>
<p>Krita is primarily a raster graphics editing tool, which means that most of the editing changes the values of the pixels on the raster that makes up the image.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Pixels-brushstroke.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Pixels-brushstroke.png" />
<p>Vector graphics on the other hand use mathematics to describe a shape. Because it uses a formula, vector graphics can be resized to any size.</p>
<p>On one hand, this makes vector graphics great for logos and banners. On the other hand, raster graphics are much easier to edit, so vectors tend to be the domain of deliberate design, using a lot of precision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tools-for-making-shapes">
<h2>Tools for making shapes</h2>
<p>You can start making vector graphics by first making a vector layer(press the arrow button next to the + in the layer docker to get extra layer types). Then, all the usual drawing tools outside of the freehand, dynamic and the multibrush tool can be used to draw shapes.</p>
<p>The path and polyline tool are the tools you used most often on a vector layer, as they allow you to make the most dynamic of shapes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Ellipse and Rectangle tools allow you to draw special shapes, which then can be edited to make special pie shapes, or for easy rounded rectangles.</p>
<p>The calligraphy and text tool also make special vectors. The calligraphy tool is for producing strokes that are similar to brush strokes, while the text tool makes a text object that can be edited afterwards.</p>
<p>All of these will use the current brush size to determine stroke thickness, as well as the current foreground and background color.</p>
<p>There is one last way to make vectors: The Vector Library docker.  It allows you to add shapes that have been defined in an SVG file as symbols. Unlike the other tools, these have their own fill and stroke.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arranging-shapes">
<h2>Arranging Shapes</h2>
<p>A vector layer has its own hierarchy of shapes, much like how the whole image has a hierarchy of layers. So shapes can be in front of one another. This can be modified with the arrange docker, or with the Select Shapes Tool.</p>
<p>The arrange docker also allows you to group and ungroup shapes. It also allows you to precisely align shapes, for example, have them aligned to the center, or have an even spacing between all the shapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-shapes">
<h2>Editing shapes</h2>
<p>Editing of vector shapes is done with the Select Shapes Tool and the Edit Shapes Tool.</p>
<p>The select shapes tool can be used to select vector shapes, to group them(via <img alt="mouseright" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_mouse_right.png" />), ungroup them, to use booleans to combine or subtract shapes from one another(via <img alt="mouseright" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_mouse_right.png" />), to move them up and down, or to do quick transforms.</p>
<div class="section" id="fill">
<h3>Fill</h3>
<p>You can change the fill of a shape by selecting it and changing the active foreground color.</p>
<p>You can also change it by going into the tool options of the Select Shapes Tool and going to the fill tab.</p>
<p>Vector shapes can be filled with a solid color, a gradient or a pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stroke">
<h3>Stroke</h3>
<p>Strokes can be filled with the same things as fills.</p>
<p>However, they can also be further changed. For example, you can add dashes and markers to the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coordinates">
<h3>Coordinates</h3>
<p>Shapes can be moved with the Select Shapes tool, and in the tool options you can specify the exact coordinates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-nodes-and-special-parameters">
<h3>Editing nodes and special parameters</h3>
<p>If you have a shape selected, you can double click it to get to the appropriate tool to edit it. Usually this is the Edit Shape Tool, but for Text this is the Text Tool.</p>
<p>In the Edit Shape Tool, you can move around nodes on the canvas for regular paths. For special paths, like the ellipse and the rectangle, you can move nodes and edit the specific parameters in the tool options docker.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="working-together-with-other-programs">
<h2>Working together with other programs</h2>
<p>One of the big things Krita 4.0 brought was moving from ODG to SVG. What this means is that Krita saves as SVG inside KRA files, and that means we can open SVGs just fine. This is important as SVG is the most popular vector format.</p>
<div class="section" id="inkscape">
<h3>Inkscape</h3>
<p>You can copy and paste vectors from Krita to Inkscape, or from Inkscape to Krita. Only the SVG 1.1 features are supported, so don’t be surprised if a mesh gradient doesn’t cross over very well.</p>
</div>
</div>

            
  <div class="section" id="snapping">
<span id="index-0"></span><span id="id1"></span>
<br><br><br><br>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Snapping</h1>
<p>In Krita 3.0, we now have functionality for Grids and Guides, but of
course, this functionality is by itself not that interesting without
snapping.</p>
<p>Snapping is the ability to have Krita automatically align a selection or
shape to the grids and guides, document center and document edges. For
Vector layers, this goes even a step further, and we can let you snap to
bounding boxes, intersections, extrapolated lines and more.</p>
<p>All of these can be toggled using the snap pop-up menu which is assigned
to <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift+S</kbd>.</p>
<p>Now, let us go over what each option means:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Grids</dt>
<dd>This will snap the cursor to the current grid, as configured in the
grid docker. This doesn’t need the grid to be visible. Grids are
saved per document, making this useful for aligning your art work to
grids, as is the case for game sprites and grid-based designs.</dd>
<dt>Guides</dt>
<dd>This allows you to snap to guides, which can be dragged out from the
ruler. Guides do not need to be visible for this, and are saved per
document. This is useful for comic panels and similar print-layouts,
though we recommend Scribus for more intensive work.</dd>
</dl>
<img alt="../_images/Snap-orthogonal.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Snap-orthogonal.png" />
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Orthogonal (Vector Only)</dt>
<dd>This allows you to snap to a horizontal or vertical line from
existing vector objects’s nodes(Unless dealing with resizing the
height or width only, in which case you can drag the cursor over the
path). This is useful for aligning object horizontally or
vertically, like with comic panels.</dd>
</dl>
<img alt="../_images/Snap-node.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Snap-node.png" />
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Node (Vector Only)</dt>
<dd>This snaps a vector node or object to the nodes of another path.</dd>
</dl>
<img alt="../_images/Snap-extension.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Snap-extension.png" />
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Extension (Vector Only)</dt>
<dd>When we draw an open path, the last nodes on either side can be
mathematically extended. This option allows you to snap to that. The
direction of the node depends on its side handles in path editing
mode.</dd>
</dl>
<img alt="../_images/Snap-intersection.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Snap-intersection.png" />
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Intersection (Vector Only)</dt>
<dd>This allows you to snap to an intersection of two vectors.</dd>
<dt>Bounding box (Vector Only)</dt>
<dd>This allows you to snap to the bounding box of a vector shape.</dd>
<dt>Image bounds</dt>
<dd>Allows you to snap to the vertical and horizontal borders of an
image.</dd>
<dt>Image center</dt>
<dd>Allows you to snap to the horizontal and vertical center of an
image.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The snap works for the following tools:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Straight line</li>
<li>Rectangle</li>
<li>Ellipse</li>
<li>Polyline</li>
<li>Path</li>
<li>Freehand path</li>
<li>Polygon</li>
<li>Gradient</li>
<li>Shape Handling tool</li>
<li>The Text-tool</li>
<li>Assistant editing tools</li>
<li>The move tool (note that it snaps to the cursor position and not the
bounding box of the layer, selection or whatever you are trying to
move)</li>
<li>The Transform tool</li>
<li>Rectangle select</li>
<li>Elliptical select</li>
<li>Polygonal select</li>
<li>Path select</li>
<li>Guides themselves can be snapped to grids and vectors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Snapping doesn’t have a sensitivity yet, and by default is set to 10
screen pixels.</p>

<h1>Animation with Krita</h1>
<p>Thanks to the 2015 Kickstarter, <strong class="program">Krita 3.0</strong> now has animation. In
specific, <strong class="program">Krita</strong> has frame-by-frame raster animation. There’s still a
lot of elements missing from it, like tweening, but the basic workflow
is there.</p>
<p>To access the animation features, the easiest way is to change your
workspace to Animation. This will make the animation dockers and
workflow appear.</p>
<div class="section" id="animation-curves">
<h2>Animation curves</h2>
<p>To create an animation curve (currently only for opacity) expand the
“New Frame” button in the “Animation” dock and click “Add Opacity
Keyframe”. You can now edit the keyframed value for opacity directly in
the “Layers” dock, adding more keyframes will by default fade from the
last to the next upcoming keyframe in the timeline over the frames
between them. See <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/dockers/animation_curve.html#animation-curves-docker"><span class="std std-ref">animation curves</span></a> for details</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workflow">
<h2>Workflow:</h2>
<p>In traditional animation workflow, what you do is that you make <em>key
frames</em>, which contain the important poses, and then draw frames in
between(<em>tweening</em> in highly sophisticated animator’s jargon).</p>
<p>For this workflow, there are three important dockers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/dockers/timeline.html#timeline-docker"><span class="std std-ref">Timeline Docker</span></a>. View and control all of
the frames in your animation. The timeline docker also contains
functions to manage your layers. The layer that are created in the
timeline docker also appear on the normal Layer docker.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/dockers/animation_docker.html#animation-docker"><span class="std std-ref">Animation Docker</span></a>. This docker contains the
play buttons as the ability to change the frame-rate, playback speed
and useful little options like <span class="guilabel">auto-key framing</span>.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/dockers/onion_skin.html#onion-skin-docker"><span class="std std-ref">Onion Skin Docker</span></a>. This docker controls
the look of the onion skin, which in turn is useful for seeing the
previous frame.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-animation-how-to-make-a-walkcycle">
<h2>Introduction to animation: How to make a walkcycle</h2>
<p>The best way to get to understand all these different parts is to
actually use them. Walk cycles are considered the most basic form of a
full animation, because of all the different parts involved with them.
Therefore, going over how one makes a walkcycle should serve as a good
introduction.</p>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>First, we make a new file:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_01.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_01.png" />
<p>On the first tab, we type in a nice ratio like 1280x1024, set the dpi to
72(we’re making this for screens after all) and title the document
‘walkcycle’.</p>
<p>In the second tab, we choose a nice background color, and set the background to canvas-color. This means that Krita will automatically fill in any transparent bits with the background color. You can change this in <span class="menuselection">image ‣ image properties</span>. This seems to be most useful to people doing animation, as the layer you do animation on MUST be semi-transparent to get onion skinning working.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Krita has a bunch of functionality for meta-data, starting at the <span class="guilabel">create document</span> screen. The title will be automatically used as a suggestion for saving and the description can be used by databases, or for you to leave comments behind. Not many people use it individually, but it can be useful for working in larger groups.</p>
</div>
<p>Then hit create!</p>
<p>Then, to get all the necessary tools for animation, select the workspace
switcher:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_02.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_02.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The red arrow points at the workspace switcher.</span></p>
</div>
<p>And select the animation workspace.</p>
<p>Which should result in this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_03.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_03.png" />
<p>The animation workspace adds the timeline, animation and onion skin
dockers at the bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="animating">
<h3>Animating</h3>
<p>We have two transparent layers set up. Let’s name the bottom one
‘environment’ and the top ‘walkcycle’ by double clicking their names in
the layer docker.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_04.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_04.png" />
<p>Use the straight line tool to draw a single horizontal line. This is
the ground.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_05.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_05.png" />
<p>Then, select the ‘walkcycle’ layer and draw a head and torso (you can use any brush for this).</p>
<p>Now, selecting a new frame will not make a new frame automatically.
Krita doesn’t actually see the ‘walkcycle’ layer as an animated layer at
all!</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_06.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_06.png" />
<p>We can make it animatable by adding a frame to the timeline. <img alt="mouseright" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Krita_mouse_right.png" /> a frame in
the timeline to get a context menu. Choose New Frame</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_07.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_07.png" />
<p>You can see it has become an animated layer because of the onion skin
icon showing up in the timeline docker.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_08.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_08.png" />
<p>Use the to copy frame to copy the
first frame onto the second. Then, use the with shift+↑ to move the
frame contents up.</p>
<p>We can see the difference by turning on the onionskinning:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_09.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_09.png" />
<p>Now, you should see the previous frame as red.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Krita sees white as a color, not as transparent, so make sure the animation layer you are working on is transparent in the bits where there’s no drawing. You can fix the situation by use the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/filters/colors.html#filter-color-to-alpha"><span class="std std-ref">Color to Alpha</span></a> filter, but prevention is best.</p>
</div>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_10.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_10.png" />
<p>Future frames are drawn in green,
and both colors can be configured in the onion skin docker.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_11.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_11.png" />
<p>Now, we’re gonna draw the two
extremes of the walkcycle. These are the pose where both legs are as far
apart as possible, and the pose where one leg is full stretched and the
other pulled in, read to take the next step.</p>
<p>Now, let’s copy these two… We could do that with <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl+drag</kbd>, but here
comes a tricky bit:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_12.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_12.png" />
<p>Ctrl+ also selects and deselects frames, so to copy…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>drag select all the frames you want to select.</li>
<li>Ctrl+++drag. You need to make sure the first frame is ‘orange’,
otherwise it won’t be copied along.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now then…</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_13.png"><img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_13.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_13.png" style="width: 580px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">squashed the timeline docker a bit to save space</span></p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Copy frame 0 to frame 2</li>
<li>Copy frame 1 to frame 3</li>
<li>In the animation docker, set the frame-rate to 4</li>
<li>select all frames in the timeline docker by dragging-selecting them.</li>
<li>press play in the animation docker.</li>
<li>Enjoy your first animation!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expanding-upon-your-rough-walkcycle">
<h3>Expanding upon your rough walkcycle</h3>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_14.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_14.png" />
<p>You can quickly make some space by <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt+dragging</kbd> any frame. This’ll move that frame and all others after it
in one go.</p>
<p>Then draw inbetweens on each frame that you add</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_16.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_16.png" />
<p>You’ll find that the more frames you add, the more difficult it becomes to keep track of the onion skins.</p>
<p>You can modify the onion skin by using the onion skin docker, where you
can change how many frames are visible at once, by toggling them on the
top row. The bottom row is for controlling transparency, while below
there you can modify the colors and extremity of the coloring.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_15.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_15.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="animating-with-multiple-layers">
<h3>Animating with multiple layers</h3>
<p>Okay, our walkcycle is missing some hands, let’s add them on a separate
layer. So we make a new layer, and name it hands and…</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_17.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_17.png" />
<p>Our walkcycle is gone from the time-line docker! This is a feature
actually. A full animation can have so many little parts that an
animator might want to remove the layers they’re not working on from the
timeline docker. So you manually have to add them.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_18.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_18.png" />
<p>You can show any given layer in the timeline by doing on the layer in
the layer docker, and toggling <span class="guilabel">show in timeline</span>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_19.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_19.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="exporting">
<h3>Exporting</h3>
<p>When you are done, select <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Export Animation</span></p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_20.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_20.png" />
<p>It’s recommended to save out your file as a png, and preferably in its
own folder. Krita can currently only export png sequences.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_21.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_21.png" />
<p>When pressing done, you can see the status of the export in the status
bar below.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_22.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_22.png" />
<p>The images should be saved out as filenameXXX.png, giving their frame
number.</p>
<p>Then use something like Gimp(Linux, OSX, Windows), ImageMagick(Linux,
OSX, Windows), or any other gif creator to make a gif out of your image
sequence:</p>
<img alt="../_images/Introduction_to_animation_walkcycle_02.gif" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Introduction_to_animation_walkcycle_02.gif" />
<p>For example, you can use
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">VirtualDub</a>(Windows) and open all the
frames and then go to File → Export → GIF</p>
<p>Enjoy your walkcycle!</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Krita 3.1 has a render animation feature. If you’re using the 3.1 beta, check out the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_manual/render_animation.html#render-animation"><span class="std std-ref">Render Animation</span></a> page for more information!</p>

<div class="section" id="importing-animation-frames">
<h2>Importing animation frames</h2>
<p>You can import animation frames in Krita 3.0.</p>
<p>First let us take a sprite sheet from Open Game Art.(This is the Libre
Pixel Cup male walkcycle)</p>
<p>And we’ll use <span class="menuselection">Image ‣ Split Image to split up the sprite sheet</span>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Animation_split_spritesheet.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Animation_split_spritesheet.png" />
<p>The slices are even, so for a sprite sheet of 9 sprites, use 8 vertical slices and 0 horizontal slices. Give it a proper name and save it as png.</p>
<p>Then, make a new canvas, and select <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Import Animation Frames</span>. This will give you a little window. Select <span class="guilabel">Add images</span>. This should get you a file browser where you can select your images.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Animation_import_sprites.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Animation_import_sprites.png" />
<p>You can select multiple images at once.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Animation_set_everything.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Animation_set_everything.png" />
<p>The frames are currently automatically
ordered. You can set the ordering with the top-left two drop-down boxes.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Start</dt>
<dd>Indicates at which point the animation should be imported.</dd>
<dt>Step</dt>
<dd>Indicates the difference between the imported animation and the
document frame rate. This animation is 8 frames big, and the fps of
the document is 24 frames, so there should be a step of 3 to keep it
even. As you can see, the window gives feedback of how much fps the
imported animation would be with the currently given step.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Press OK, and your animation should be imported as a new layer.</p>

<h1>Japanese Animation Template</h1>
<p>This template is used to make Japanese-style animation. It is designed
on the assumption that it was used in co-production, so please customize
its things like layer folders according to scale and details of your
works.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-structure-of-its-layers">
<h2>Basic structure of its layers</h2>
<p>Layers are organized so that your work will start from lower layers go
to higher layers, except for coloring layers.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Layer_Organization.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Layer_Organization.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="its-layer-contents">
<h2>Its layer contents</h2>
<p>from the bottom</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Layout Paper</dt>
<dd>These layers are a form of layout paper. Anime tap holes are prepared on separate layers in case you have to print it out and continue your drawing traditionally.</dd>
<dt>Layout (Background)</dt>
<dd>These layers will contain background scenery or layouts which are scanned from a traditional drawing. If you don’t use them, you can remove them.</dd>
<dt>Key drafts</dt>
<dd>These layers are used to draw layouts digitally.</dd>
<dt>Keys</dt>
<dd>Where you add some details to the layouts and arrange them to draw “keys” of animation.</dd>
<dt>Inbetweening</dt>
<dd>Where you add inbetweens to keys for the process of coloring, and remove unnecessary details to finalize keys (To be accurate, I finish finalization of keys before beginning to add inbetweens)</dd>
<dt>Coloring (under Inbetweening)</dt>
<dd>Where you fill areas with colors according to specification of inbetweens.</dd>
<dt>Time Sheet and Composition sheet</dt>
<dd>This contains a time sheet and composition sheet. Please rotate them before using.</dd>
<dt>Color set</dt>
<dd>This contains colors used to draw main and auxiliary line art and fill highlight or shadows. You can add them to your palette.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-steps-to-make-animation">
<h2>Basic steps to make animation</h2>
<p>Key draft –&gt; assign them into Time sheet (or adjust them on Timeline, then assign them into Time sheet) –&gt; adjust them on Timeline –&gt; add frames to draw drafts for inbetweening if you need them –&gt; Start drawing Keys</p>
<img alt="../_images/Keys_drafts.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Keys_drafts.png" />
<p>You can add layers and add them to timeline.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Add_Timeline_1.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Add_Timeline_1.png" />
<img alt="../_images/Add_Timeline_2.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Add_Timeline_2.png" />
<p>This is due difference between 24 drawing per second, which is used in Full Animation, and 12 drawing per second and 8 drawings per second, which are used in Limited Animation, on the Timeline docker.</p>
<img alt="../_images/24_12_and_8_drawing_per_sec.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/24_12_and_8_drawing_per_sec.png" />
<p>This is correspondence between Timeline and Time sheet. “Black” layer is to draw main line art which are used ordinary line art, “Red” layer is to draw red auxiliary linearts which are used to specify highlights, “Blue” layer is to draw blue auxiliary linearts which are used to specify shadows, and “Shadow” layer is to draw light green auxiliary line art which are used to specify darker shadows. However, probably you have to increase or decrease these layers according to your work.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Time_sheet_1.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Time_sheet_1.png" />
<p>Finished keys, you will begin to draw the inbetweens. If you feel Krita is becoming slow, I recommend you to merge key drafts and keys, as well as to remove any unnecessary layers.</p>
<p>After finalizing keys and cleaning up unnecessary layers, add
inbetweenings, using Time sheet and inbetweening drafts as reference.</p>
<p>This is its correspondence with Time sheetL</p>
<img alt="../_images/Inbetweening.png" src="https://docs.krita.org/en/_images/Inbetweening.png" />
<p>Once the vector functionality of Krita becomes better, I recommend you to use vector to finalize inbetweening.</p>
<p>If you do the colors in Krita, please use Coloring group layer. If you do
colors in other software, I recommend to export frames as .TGA files.</p>
<div class="section" id="resolution">
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>I made this template in 300 dpi because we have to print them to use them in traditional works which still fill an important role in Japanese Anime Studio. However, if you stick to digital, 150-120 dpi is enough to make animation. So you can decrease its resolution according to your need.</p>

<p>Windows users have a habit of uninstalling and reinstalling applications to solve problems. Unless the problem is that the installation was corrupted by a virus scanner or drive failure, that will NOT work. Uninstalling Krita then reinstalling replaces the bytes on your drive with exactly the same bytes that were there before. It doesn’t reset anything, least of all Krita’s settings.</p>

<p>Causes for this could be the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It might be that your download got corrupted and is missing files (common with bad wifi and bad internet connection in general), in that case, try to find a better internet connection before trying to download again. Krita should be around 80 to 100 mb in size when downloading.</li>
<li>It might be that something went wrong during installation. Check whether your harddrive is full and reinstall Krita with at least 120 MB of empty space. If not, and the problem still occurs, there might be something odd going on with your device and it’s recommended to find a computer expert to diagnose what is the problem.</li>
<li>Some unzippers don’t unpack our zipfiles correctly. The native ones on windows, OSX and most linux distributions should be just fine, and we recommend using them.</li>
<li>You manually, using a file manager deleted or moved resources around, and thus Krita cannot find them anymore.</li>

<div id="what-graphics-cards-does-krita-support">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">What Graphics Cards does Krita support?</a></h3>
<p>Krita can use OpenGL to accelerate painting and canvas zooming, rotation and panning. Nvidia and recent Intel GPUs give the best results. Make sure your OpenGL drivers support OpenGL 3.2 as the minimum. AMD/ATI GPU’s are known to be troublesome, especially with the proprietary drivers on Linux. However, it works perfectly with the Radeon free driver on linux for supported AMD GPU. Try to get a graphics card that can support OpenGL 3.2 or above for the best results, some examples:</p>
<dl class="docutils">

<div id="how-much-memory-does-my-image-take">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">How much memory does my image take?</a></h3>
<p>For simple images, its easy to calculate: you multiply width * height * channels * size of the channels (so, for a 1000×1000 16 bit integer rgba image: 1000 x 1000 x 4 x 2). You multiply this by the number of layers plus two (one for the image, one for the display). If you add masks, filter layers or clone layers, it gets more complicated.</p>

<div id="why-do-i-get-a-checkerboard-pattern-when-i-use-the-eraser">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Why do I get a checkerboard pattern when I use the eraser?</a></h3>
<p>You’re probably used to Gimp or Photoshop. The default background or first layer in these applications doesn’t have an alpha channel by default. Thus, on their background layer, the eraser paints in the background color.</p>
<p>In Krita, all layers have an alpha channel, if you want to paint in the background color, you should simply do it in a layer above the first one (Layer 1), that would prevent  you from erasing the white background color, making the checkerboard visible. You get the same effect in, say, gimp, if you create new image, add an alpha channel and then use the eraser tool. Most Krita users will actually start a sketch in Krita by adding a new blank layer first before doing anything else. (the INSert key is a useful shortcut here). That doesn’t use extra memory, since a blank layer or a layer with a default color just takes one pixel worth of memory.</p>

<div id="how-to-fix-a-tablet-offset-on-multiple-screen-setup-on-windows">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">How to fix a tablet offset on multiple screen setup on Windows</a></h3>
<p>If you see that your tablet pointer has an offset when working with Krita canvas, it might be highly probable that Krita got incorrect screen resolution from the system. That problem happens mostly when an external monitor is present and when either a monitor or a tablet was connected after the system boot.</p>
<p>You can fix this issue manually by:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Put your stylus away from the tablet.</li>
<li>Start Krita without using a stylus, that is using a mouse or a keyboard.</li>
<li>Press Shift key and hold it.</li>
<li>Touch a tablet with your stylus so Krita would recognize it.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will see a special dialog asking for the real screen resolution. Choose the correct value or enter it manually and press OK.</p>
<p>If you have a dual monitor setup and only the top half of the screen is reachable, you might have to enter the total width of both screens plus the double height of your monitor in this field.</p>
<p>If this didn’t work, and if you have a Wacom tablet, an offset in the canvas can be caused by a faulty Wacom preference file which is not removed or replaced by reinstalling the drivers.</p>
<p>To fix it, use the “Wacom Tablet Preference File Utility” to clear all the preferences. This should allow Krita to detect the correct settings automatically.</p>

<div id="why-is-krita-free">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id47">Why is Krita Free?</a></h3>
<p>Krita is developed as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/">free software</a> within the KDE community. We believe that good tools should be available for all artists. You can also buy Krita on the Windows Store if you want to support Krita’s development or want to have automatic updates to newer versions.</p>

<div id="can-i-use-krita-commercially">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id48">Can I use Krita commercially?</a></h3>
<p>Yes. What you create with Krita is your sole property. You own your work and can license your art however you want. Krita’s GPL license applies to Krita’s source code. Krita can be used commercially by artists for any purpose, by studios to make concept art, textures, or vfx, by game artists to work on commercial games, by scientists for research, and by students in educational institutions.</p>
<p>If you modify Krita itself, and distribute the result, you have to share your modifications with us. Krita’s GNU GPL license guarantees you this freedom. Nobody is ever permitted to take it away.</p>

<div id="who-translates-krita">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id50">Who translates Krita</a></h3>
<p>Krita is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE application</a> — and proud of it! That means that Krita’s translations are done by <a class="reference external" href="http://i18n.kde.org/">KDE localization teams</a>. If you want to help out, join the team for your language! There is another way you can help out making Krita look good in any language, and that is join the development team and fix issues within the code that make Krita harder to translate.</p>
