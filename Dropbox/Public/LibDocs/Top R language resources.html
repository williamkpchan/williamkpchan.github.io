<h2 id="basics">Learn R language basics</h2>
<p>To build on those beginner skills, 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399" rel="nofollow">R for Data Science</a> gives readers a firm grounding in basic aspects of data analysis, from import and cleaning to visualizing and modeling. Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund both work at RStudio, Wickham as chief scientist and Grolemund as master instructor. Wickham is well known for his suite of R packages dubbed the "tidyverse," and this book is designed for those who want to use tidyverse packages such as dplyr and purrr.
</p>
<p>
<em>R for Data Science
</em> is available 
<a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">for free online</a> as well as 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399" rel="nofollow">in paperback from Amazon</a>. (An 
<a href="https://medium.com/@kierisi/r4ds-the-next-iteration-d51e0a1b0b82" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">independent Slack community</a> launched last year for people working through the book.)

<p>I can recommend at least two other general books for expanding a beginner's knowledge: 
<em>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/013454692X/" rel="nofollow">R for Everyone</a>
</em> by Jared P. Lander and 
<em>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/24-Hours-Sams-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672338483" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sams Teach Yourself R in 24 Hours</a>
</em> by three Mango Solutions consultants. 
<em>R for Everyone
</em> is a smaller volume that's focused a bit more on statistics, with sections on topics like T-Tests, ANOVA, Poisson regression and survival analysis. 
<em>Teach Yourself R
</em> is the broadest of the three, ranging from discussions of R class systems to the Shiny Web framework. (Disclaimer: I'm writing an R book for publisher Taylor &amp; Francis due out late this year or early 2019.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>R interactive
</strong>
</p>
<p>Interactive learning company Datacamp offers a few free classes, although most require a monthly or yearly paid subscription. The platform features an R cloud implementation, so students can do exercises and get immediate feedback to see if their code is correct. The 
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introduction to R course</a>, estimated to take four hours, is free.

<h2 id="questions">Ask questions</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> has long been a programmers' go-to source for asking questions; it has an active R community. To search for answers before posting your own query, make sure to use the 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[r] tag</a>. There are other, more specific R-related tags there, too, such as 
<code>[ggplot2]
</code>, 
<code>[dplyr]
</code> and 
<code>[dataframe]
</code>.
</p>
<p>RStudio launched 
<a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">its own community</a>, which is geared toward issues surrounding RStudio-created packages and other RStudio software. There's also a category for 
<a href="https://community.rstudio.com/c/general" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">general questions</a>. Responses tend be a bit less harsh than at Stack Overflow for newbies making rookie errors.
</p>
<p>The 
<a href="https://medium.com/@kierisi/r4ds-the-next-iteration-d51e0a1b0b82" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R for Data Science Slack community</a> mentioned above is also a good place to ask questions. There are a lot of channels in that Slack, so it helps to read up on what each is for so you know where best to post your query.
</p>
<p>While it's tough to use Twitter to get coding help, it can be a good place to ask questions such a,s "Does anyone know of a package that will...". Make sure to use the 
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#rstats</a> hash tag. 
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/R-Project-Statistical-Computing-77616" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and 
<a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117681470673972651781" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google+</a> also have fairly active R groups where questions are regularly asked and answered.
</p>
<h2 id="viz">Visualize your data</h2>
<p>My 
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2935394/business-intelligence/my-ggplot2-cheat-sheet-search-by-task.html">ggplot2 cheat sheet</a> is a sortable table, searchable by tasks like coloring by category or rotating x-axis labels. The cheat sheet article includes downloadable 
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2936729/data-analytics/free-download-save-r-data-visualization-time-with-these-ggplot2-code-snippets.html">ggplot2 RStudio code snippets</a>, offering ready-to-use, fill-in-the-placeholder code for a variety of ggplot2 tasks.
</p>
<p>The 
<a href="http://shinyapps.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R Graph Catalog</a> features lots of graph and other plot examples, easily searchable and each with downloadable code. All are made with ggplot2 based on visualization ideas in

<p>ggplot2 has become an extensible platform, not just a package. There's a 
<a href="http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gallery of registered extensions</a> if you'd like to see what additional capabilities are available.
</p>
<p>For those who'd like to use base R graphics instead of ggplot2, Nathan Yau of the Flowing Data blog has an excellent tutorial including downloadable code: 
<a href="http://flowingdata.com/2012/12/17/getting-started-with-charts-in-r/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Getting Started with Charts in R</a>.
</p>
<p>If you are interested in mapping with R, I posted a tutorial, 
<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3038270/data-analytics/create-maps-in-r-in-10-fairly-easy-steps.html">Create maps in R in 10 (fairly) easy steps</a>, that covers both static and interactive maps.

<p>And, to search for "html widget" packages that generate interactive graphics, check out the 
<a href="http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">html widget gallery</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="advance">Advance your skills</h2>
<p>RStudio has hosted dozens of webinars on a wide variety of topics for varied skill levels. On-demand replays are available at the 
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RStudio website's resource area</a>, including some recordings from the annual rstudio::conf event.
</p>
<p>RStudio also has posted a number of 
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF cheat sheets</a> for various packages and tasks. All are available for free download.
</p>
<p>If you're at all interested in learning the relatively new tidyverse package 
<a href="http://purrr.tidyverse.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">purrr</a>, I highly recommend 
<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Solving-iteration-problems-with-purrr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Charlotte Wickham's purrr tutorial</a> from the 2017 useR! international R user conference.
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, 
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:r" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Datacamp</a> is a source for learning R, and not just for beginners. It has a range of course offerings on subjects spanning general R to specifics such as machine learning and time series forecasting. For most classes, you'll need a paid subscription.

<p>To find in-person meetups, check the 
<a href="https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html#north-america" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unofficial R User Group listing</a> maintained by consultancy Jumping Rivers, or 
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/r-project-for-statistical-computing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Meetup.com's R page</a>. The global 
<a href="https://rladies.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R-Ladies</a> organization may also be of interest.
</p>
<p>R Markdown makes it easy to combine text and R code as well as output to multiple formats such as HTML, PDF and Word. The 
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RStudio R Markdown website</a> features tutorials and a 
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gallery of outputs and formats</a>. In addition, R for Data Science has a fairly extensive chapter on 
<a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R Markdown formats</a>.
</p>
<p>If you are serious about becoming an advanced R programmer, Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book is available 
<a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">free online</a> or 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Chapman-Hall-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1466586966" rel="nofollow">from Amazon</a>.
</p>
<p>And, if you're interested in using TensorFlow with R, it would be well worth your time to watch 
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-and-r/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">J.J. Allaire's keynote about TensorFlow</a> at the 2018 RStudio conference. In that talk, he recommended his book 
<em>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X/" rel="nofollow">Deep Learning with R</a>
</em>, co-authored with Francois Chollet, for those interested in diving in with R (and not interested in reading about TensorFlow's high-level mathematical concepts). RStudio also has a section of its site devoted to 
<a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TensorFlow for R</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="whatsnew">Keep up with new developments</h2>
<p>I often tweet important and interesting news about R. If you're on Twitter, you can follow me at 
<a href="https://twitter.com/sharon000" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@sharon000</a>. RStudio's Mara Averick 
<a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@dataandme</a> and Microsoft's David Smith 
<a href="https://twitter.com/revodavid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@revodavid</a> are two other accounts worth following for R news.
</p>
<p>Want to find incredibly useful functions and packages? I periodically update these two lists: 
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2921176/business-intelligence/great-r-packages-for-data-import-wrangling-visualization.html">Great R packages for data import, wrangling &amp; visualization</a> and 
<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3184778/data-analytics/6-useful-r-functions-you-might-not-know.html">Useful R functions you might not know</a>.
</p>
<p>The 
<a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Revolutions blog</a>, now part of Microsoft, keeps tabs on a wide variety of R technical updates.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rweekly.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R Weekly</a> is a community effort to round up interesting uses of R as well as new packages and compelling blog posts.
</p>
<h2 id="packages">Package and repo info</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CRAN</a> is the official repository for R packages. However, 
<a href="https://www.r-pkg.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MetaCRAN</a> is a more visually appealing version if you're trying to search or browse. It includes CRAN "task views," which compile useful packages for specific fields such as machine learning. MetaCRAN also lets you see CRAN packages with the most stars on GitHub.
</p>
<p>With more than 12,500 CRAN R packages, it can be hard to know what packages out there might solve a problem you have, or even remember which packages have what functions. The 
<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RDocumentation website</a> lets you search for packages 
<em>or functions
</em>. By DataCamp.
</p>
<p>To see what R GitHub repositories are popular, use 
<a href="https://github.com/trending/r" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub's Trending on R search</a>. Hadley Wickham also has a repo, 
<a href="https://github.com/hadley/r-on-github" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">r-on-github</a>, that lets you collect data about all R projects on GitHub.
</p>
<p>For information about packages with color palettes you can use in R, check out Emil Hvitfeldt's

</p>
<h2 id="shiny">Shiny Web framework</h2>
<p>If you'd like to learn how to make full-fledged Web apps with R, RStudio's Shiny framework is one option. The 
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RStudio Shiny site</a> has a number of articles and tutorials, as well as 
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a gallery of examples</a>.
</p>
<p>Datacamp offers a free online interactive course, 
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-web-applications-in-r-with-shiny" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Building Web Applications in R with Shiny</a>, by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, associate professor at Duke University &amp; data scientist and educator at RStudio.
</p>
<p>To create an interactive dashboard – as opposed to an entire application – there's RStudio's 
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shinydashboard project</a>. See the 
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">get started article</a> for how to begin. For dashboards with even less code (but also less interactivity), there's

Like the rest of the O'Reilly Cookbook series, this one offers how-to "recipes" for doing lots of different tasks, from the basics of R installation and creating simple data objects to generating probabilities, graphics and linear regressions. It has the added bonus of being well written. If you like learning by example or are seeking a good R reference book, this is well worth adding to your reference library. Caution: with a 2011 publication date, it's missing a lot of developments in the language. By Paul Teetor, a quantitative developer working in the financial sector. <a name="rinaction" rel="nofollow"/></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/R-Graphics-Cookbook-Winston-Chang/dp/1449316956/" rel="nofollow">R Graphics Cookbook</a>. If you want to do beyond-the-basics graphics in R, this is a useful resource both for its graphics recipes and brief introduction to ggplot2. While this goes way beyond the graphics capabilities that <em>I </em> need in R, I'd recommend this if you're looking to move beyond advanced-beginner plotting. By Winston Chang, a software engineer at RStudio. <a name="art" rel="nofollow"/></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Action-Data-Analysis-Graphics/dp/1617291382/" rel="nofollow">R in Action: Data analysis and graphics with R</a>. This book aims at all levels of users, with sections for beginning, intermediate and advanced R ranging from "Exploring R data structures" to running regressions and conducting factor analyses. The beginner's section may be a bit tough to follow if you haven't had <em>any </em>exposure to R, but it offers a good foundation in data types, imports and reshaping once you've had a bit of experience. There are some particularly useful explanations and examples for aggregating, restructuring and subsetting data, as well as a lot of applied statistics. Note that if your interest in graphics is learning ggplot2, there's relatively little on that here compared with base R graphics. You can see an excerpt from the book online: <a href="http://www.r-statistics.com/2012/01/aggregation-and-restructuring-data-from-r-in-action/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aggregation and restructuring data</a>.

For those who want to move beyond using R "in an ad hoc way ... to develop[ing] software in R." This is best if you're already at least moderately proficient in another programming language. It's a good resource for systematically learning fundamentals such as types of objects, control statements (unlike many R purists, the author doesn't actively discourage for loops), variable scope, classes and debugging -- in fact, there's nearly as large a chapter on debugging as there is on graphics. With some robust examples of solving real-world statistical problems in R.

A reasonably readable guide to R that teaches the language's fundamentals -- syntax, functions, data structures and so on -- as well as how-to statistical and graphics tasks. Useful if you want to start writing robust R programs, as it includes sections on functions, object-oriented programming and high-performance R.

Author Jared P. Lander promises to go over "20% of the functionality needed to accomplish 80% of the work." And in fact, topics that are actually covered, are covered pretty well; but be warned that some items appearing in the table of contents can be a little thin. This is still a well-organized reference, though, with information that beginning and intermediate users might want to know: importing data, generating graphs, grouping and reshaping data, working with basic stats and more. <a name="advancedR" rel="nofollow"/></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/resources/106345/data-analytics/advanced-beginners-guide-to-r">Advanced Beginner's Guide to R</a></strong>.

Despite the name, this book is appropriate for anyone at the advanced beginner stage and above -- and also for programmers proficient in another language who want to understand R's somewhat unconventional features. It starts with basics such as data structures and subsetting and goes through more technical details like memory management, profiling and rewriting code in C++ using R's Rcpp package. The book's content is available free on the Web, or there's a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">paperback version</a> on Amazon.

I haven't had a chance to read this one, but it's garnered some good reviews on Amazon. If you're familiar with the Dummies series and have found them helpful in the past, you might want to check this one out. You can get a taste of the authors' style in dummies.com posts such as <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-construct-vectors-in-r.html" rel="nofollow">How to construct vectors in R</a> and <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-the-apply-family-of-functions-in-r.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">How to use the apply family of functions in R</a>.

This book has you "pretend" you're a strategist for an ancient Chinese kingdom analyzing military strategies with R. If you find that idea hokey, move along to see another resource; if not, you'll get a beginner-level introduction to various tasks in R, including tasks you don't always see in an intro text, such as multiple linear regressions and forecasting. Note: My early e-version had a considerable amount of bad spaces in my Kindle app, but it was still readable and usable. And be warned it was published in 2010; a lot has happened in R since then. <a name="websites" rel="nofollow"/></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/24-Hours-Sams-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672338483/" rel="nofollow">Sams Tech Yourself R in 24 Hours</a>.

I think they're both informative and fun, a welcome antidote to the typically dry how-to's you often find in statistical programming. Analyst Anthony Damico takes on R in 2-minute chunks, from "how to create a variable with R" to "how to plot residuals from a regression in R;" he also tackles an occasional problem such as "how to calculate your ten, fifteen, or twenty thousandth day on earth with R." I'd strongly recommend giving this a look if textbook-style instruction leaves you cold.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffR3fWv4xw&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Developers' Intro to R</a>.</strong> This series of 21 short YouTube videos includes some basic R concepts, a few lessons on reshaping data and some info on loops.
