<p>Basically, R language you can use in six ways.You can use the built-in console, you can process your projects through the integrated development environment (IDE), you can use a number of graphical user interfaces (GUI), you can use R features from other applications or services. R terminal you can attach on your computer or you can use it via several online services (data science platforms). Another option is to use R from other languages, such as from Python or F#. In the following chapters are briefly presented various options and R use cases that you can utilize.</p>

<p>
<p>In the case of R distributions, we mean the core R runtime - the console interface for running your R scripts. 
We know the main distribution from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">r-project.org</a> site. All other distributions I know are based on this distribution. If you are using R in whatever form, it is 99.9 % certain that you are using this distribution. This distribution is multiplatform and distributed entirely under open-source licenses (mostly GPL).</p>
<p>The second well-known distribution of R maintains and develops Mistrosoft (<a href="https://mran.microsoft.com/open" target="_blank">MRO</a>). Formerly Revolution Analytics. MRO is an enhanced distribution for improved performance, reproducibility and platform support.</p>
<p>The third distribution is offered by Oracle (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/r/r-enterprise/overview/index.html" target="_blank">ORE</a>). This company has also enriched the basic R distribution by packages that facilitate the integration with Oracle databases.</p>
<p>Finally, the last distribution is <a href="http://stagraph.com/Current" target="_blank">R4Stagraph</a>. This distribution have pre-installed all R packages used by Stagraph software and does not contain any modifications to the basic R distribution.</p>

<p>Probably the most commonly users works with the R language through an external IDE. In this case, we consider as IDE (integrated development environment) a tool / application that simplifies custom R scripts writing, editing and debugging. IDE is an environment where the output is the source code that defines your analysis and data processing. The difference between IDE and GUI is that the IDE helps you write R scripts and GUI writes it automatically, according to the steps you have defined through the visual interface (menus, lists, buttons). In the field of R IDE, you have very extensive options at the time and we will present them briefly. In this section we will introduce only desktop solutions. R IDE as online service will be presented in the <a href="#r_online">R Online</a> section.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/" target="_blank"><b>R Studio</b></a><br/>
If you work with R often, you probably use the R Studio. This is an open-source IDE (desktop or server based) that contains all the features we expect from a similar tool. At present, this IDE is a defacto standard. R Studio contains many features to help you with every step. Additionally, the company is intensively working on R improving through the development of open-source <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/" target="_blank">R packages</a> (Tidyverse, R Markdown and other) and running environments such as Shiny Server.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/features/rtvs/" target="_blank"><b>R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS)</b></a><br/>
I think RTVS is the second best IDE tool at present. RTVS is integrated as a plugin directly into Visual Studio. If you work also with other languages, you will certainly appreciate this tool.</p>

RCode is a relatively new R IDE that includes several interesting features such as direct editing of variables, enriched script editor, interactive visualization of variables, flexible layout, file explorer and more. It will be interesting to follow its further development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><b>RGUI</b></a><br/>
RGUI.exe is a very simple IDE and is distributed along with the R installation. It contains only very few features that we would expect from the IDE. After launch, you only see the R console. You can manually display a script editor without features such as code autocompletion or syntax highlighting. In spite of simplicity, it is a very often used interface for R scripts writing and executing.</p>
<p><a href="https://ess.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><b>Emacs with ESS Package</b></a><br/>
Emacs with ESS Package is an IDE, designed to support editing of scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis programs such as R, S-Plus, SAS, Stata and OpenBUGS/JAGS. In community is relatively popular and often used.</p>

<p>As R GUI (graphical user interface) we consider applications that provides a visual interface which allows you to use R features without the need of manual scripts writing (point-and-click or drag-and-drop). There is no sharp border between IDE and GUI applications. Very often R GUI apps allows you to write custom scripts. This makes it possible to extend these applications. An example can be data import from specific sources (e.g. web services).</p>
<p>R GUI apps can be divided into general-purpose and specific. General-purpose applications make available general R functions, such as functions for data wrangling, data visualization or statistical analysis. Conversely, specific-purpose applications provides only a selected set of features that targets selected area of data analysis (e.g. spatial data analysis or clustering functions). In the following text are listed the most widely used R GUI applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rcommander.com/" target="_blank"><b>R Commander</b></a><br/> 
The program enables analysts to access a selection of commonly-used R commands using a simple interface that should be familiar to most computer users. It also serves the important role of helping users to implement R commands and develop their knowledge and expertise in using the command line, an important skill for those wishing to exploit the full power of the program.</p>
<p><a href="https://rattle.togaware.com/" target="_blank"><b>Rattle</b></a><br/>
Rattle is a popular GUI for data mining in R. It presents statistical and visual summaries of data, transforms data so that it can be readily modeled, builds both unsupervised and supervised machine learning models from the data, presents the performance of models graphically, and scores new datasets for deployment into production. A key features is that all of your interactions through the graphical user interface are captured as an R script that can be readily executed in R independently of the Rattle interface. </p>

<h2>R From Other Apps</h2>
<p>A popular way to extend the existing functionality of any program that works with data (in any form) is to integrate it with the R language. You can use features that are not directly supported in the existing interface. This integration allows you to write the R script that process your data from the main application in R terminal. After execution, the result is imported back into the program. This feature has many programs and platforms. As an example, we can state the following:</p>

<h2>R From Other Languages</h2>
<p>R language is very good tool for data analysis. Other languages are focused on desktop applications or web 
services development. By combining them, you can quickly and efficiently create complex and robust solutions. Therefore, R is often 
used from other languages. On the Internet, you can find many use cases. As an example, the following languages may be mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rpy2.bitbucket.io/" target="_blank"><b>Python</b></a></li>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~fangly/Statistics-R-0.34/lib/Statistics/R.pm" target="_blank"><b>Perl</b></a></li>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The R language is today a well known, widely supported and mature technology. If you know programming in that language, it can help you to solve a number of problems.</p>
<p>In the article, we looked where and how you can benefit from the R platform. If you know this language, you can use it mostly through IDE tools. For less sophisticated users, there are many GUI applications that make R features accessible via the visual interface, without the need of manual coding. You can use R language in desktop applications or using different types of web services.</p>
<p>This article contains only a part of the R language use cases. If you know about other that are not mentioned in article, do not hesitate to contact me via mail or discussion. I’d like to learn about new option and I will add it to the list.</p>
