<h2>Git Workflow</h2>
<br>
<h3>git init</h3>
The word init means initialize. <br>
The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.<br>
<br>
A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files<br>
A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory<br>
A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project<br>
<br>
The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository. <br>
In Git, we save changes with a commit.<br>
<br>
<h3>git status</h3>
Check the status of changes:<br>
git status<br>
<br>
<h3>git add</h3>
In order for Git to start tracking scene-1.txt, the file needs to be added to the staging area.<br>
<br>
We can add a file to the staging area with:<br>
<br>
git add filename<br>
The word filename here refers to the name of the file you are editing, such as scene-1.txt.<br>
<br>
<h3>git diff</h3>
we can check the differences between the working directory and the staging area with:<br>
git diff filename<br>
<br>
<h3>git commit</h3>
A commit is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.<br>
<br>
git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"<br>
<br>
Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:<br>
Must be in quotation marks<br>
Written in the present tense<br>
Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m<br>
<br>
<h3>git log</h3>
Often with Git, you'll need to refer back to an earlier version of a project. Commits are stored chronologically in the repository and can be viewed with:<br>
<br>
<h3>Generalizations</h3>
git init creates a new Git repository<br>
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area<br>
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area<br>
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area<br>
git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository<br>
git log shows a list of all previous commits<br>
<br>
<br>
This command takes a remote name and a repository URL, which in your case is  https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git.<br>
<br>
<h3>git remote add</h3>
git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git<br>
git remote add new https://github.com/williamkpchan/williamkpchan.github.io<br>
<br>
<h3>Pushing Remotely</h3>
The push command tells Git where to put our commits.<br>
<br>
The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do.<br>
<br>
<h3>git push -u origin master</h3>
<br>
<br>
We can check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes by running:<br>
<h3>git pull origin master</h3>
<br>
Take a look at what is different from our last commit by using the git diff command.<br>
<br>
In this case we want the diff of our most recent commit, which we can refer to using the HEAD pointer.<br>
<h3>git diff HEAD</h3>
<br>
Another great use for diff is looking at changes within files that have already been staged.<br>
<br>
git diff with the --staged option to see the changes you just staged.<br>
git diff --staged<br>
<br>
You can unstage files by using the git reset command.<br>
git reset octofamily/octodog.txt<br>
<br>
Files can be changed back to how they were at the last commit by using the command:  git checkout -- <target><br>
<br>
<h3>git checkout -- octocat.txt</h3>
<br>
Create a copy (aka.  branch)<br>
Then done they can merge this branch back into their main master branch.<br>
<br>
create a branch called clean_up<br>
git branch clean_up<br>
<br>
<h3>Switching Branches</h3>
you'll see two local branches: <br>
a main branch named  master and <br>
new branch named clean_up<br>
<br>
<br>
switch branches using the git checkout <branch> command<br>
<h3>git checkout clean_up</h3>
<br>
<h3>Removing All The Things</h3>
git rm command which will not only remove the actual files from disk, but will also stage the removal of the files for us.<br>
git rm '*.txt'<br>
<br>
Now that you've removed all the cats you'll need to commit your changes.<br>
git commit -m "Remove all the cats"<br>
<br>
Switching Back to master<br>
git checkout master<br>
<br>
Preparing to Merge<br>
We're already on the master branch, so we just need to tell Git to merge the clean_up branch into it:<br>
<h3>git merge clean_up</h3>
<br>
git branch -d <branch name> to delete a branch<br>
<br>
git branch -d clean_up<br>
<br>
Final Push<br>
<h3>git push</h3>



git remote add origin https://github.com/williamkpchan/williamkpchan.github.io.git<br>
git pull origin master<br>
git push -u origin master<br>
git commit -m "second commit"<br>
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/williamkpchan/williamkpchan.github.io.git<br>
