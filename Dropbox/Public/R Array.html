<center><h3>R Array</h3></center>
<br>
<p>
Array is R data type which has multiple dimensions.
<br>
 <code>array()</code> function creates or tests for arrays.<br>

 <code>dim()</code> function defines the dimension of an array.
<br><br>
<pre class=r>
array(data=NA, dim=length(data), dimnames=NULL)
</pre>
<br>
<code>data</code>: vector to fill the array<br>
<code>dim</code>: row and col numbers<br>
<code></code>: <br>
<code>...</code>
</pre>

<pre class=gr>
Example
theArray <- array(1:24,c(2,3,4)) 

dimnames(theArray) = list( 
c("row1", "row2"),
c("col1", "col2", "col3"),
c("layer1", "layer2", "layer3", "layer4"))

theArray[,,"layer4"]

<H3>Ways to create arrays</A></H3>

<OL>
<LI>Common ways to create <B>vectors</B> (or one-dimensional arrays)
include:  
<PRE>
&gt; a &lt;- c(3, 7, 9, 11)    # Concatenates numeric values into a vector
&gt; a &lt;- c("a", "b", "c")  # Concatenates character strings into a vector
&gt; a &lt;- 1:5               # Creates a vector of integers from 1 to 5 inclusive  
&gt; a &lt;- rep(1, times = 5) # Creates a vector of 5 repeated `1's
</PRE>
To manipulate a vector:  
<PRE>
&gt; a[10]                # Extracts the 10th value from the vector `a'
&gt; a[5] &lt;- 3.14         # Inserts 3.14 as the 5th value in the vector `a'
&gt; a[5:7] &lt;- c(2, 4, 7) # Replaces the 5th through 7th values with 2, 4, and 7
</PRE>
<I>Unlike</I> larger arrays, vectors can be extended without first
creating another vector of the correct length.  Hence, 
<PRE>
&gt; a &lt;- c(4, 6, 8) 
&gt; a[5] &lt;- 9       # Inserts a 9 in the 5th position of the vector,
                  #  automatically inserting an `NA' values position 4
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="factors"></A> A <B>factor vector</B> is a special type of
vector.  R creates this special class of vector from a pre-existing vector <TT>x</TT>
using the <TT>factor()</TT> command, which separates <TT>x</TT> into levels
based on the discrete values observed in <TT>x</TT>.  These values may be
either integer value or character strings.  For example,
<PRE>
&gt; x &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9)
&gt; factor(x)
   [1] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 9 9 9 9
   Levels: 1 2 9
</PRE>
By default, <TT>factor()</TT> creates unordered factors, which are
  treated as discrete, rather than ordered, levels.  Add the optional
  argument <TT>ordered = TRUE</TT> to order the factors in the vector:
<PRE>  
&gt; x &lt;- c("like", "dislike", "hate", "like", "don't know", "like", "dislike")
&gt; factor(x, levels = c("hate", "dislike", "like", "don't know"),
+        ordered = TRUE)
  [1] like    dislike    hate    like   don't know   like   dislike   
Levels: hate &lt; dislike &lt; like &lt; don't know
</PRE>
  The <TT>factor()</TT> command orders the levels according to the order in
  the optional argument <TT>levels</TT>.  If you omit the levels command,
  R will order the values as they occur in the vector.  Thus, omitting
  the <TT>levels</TT> argument sorts the levels as <TT>like &lt; dislike &lt;
    hate &lt; don't know</TT> in the example above.  If you omit one or more
  of the levels in the list of levels, R returns levels values of <TT>    NA</TT> for the missing level(s):
<PRE>
&gt; factor(x, levels = c("hate", "dislike", "like"), ordered = TRUE)
  [1] like    dislike hate    like    &lt;NA&gt;    like    dislike
Levels: hate &lt; dislike &lt; like
</PRE>
Use factored vectors within data frames for plotting, to set the values of the explanatory variables using
<TT>setx</TT> and in the ordinal logit and multinomial
logit models.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Build <B>matrices</B> (or two-dimensional arrays) from vectors
(one-dimensional arrays).  You can create a matrix in two ways:   

<OL>
<LI>From a vector: Use the command <TT>matrix(vector, nrow
    =</TT> 3
<TT>, ncol =</TT> 2
<TT>)</TT> to create a <!-- MATH
 $k \times n$
 -->

    matrix from the vector by filling in the columns from left to
    right.  For example,
<PRE>
&gt; matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
        [,1] [,2] [,3]       # Note that when assigning a vector to a
   [1,]    1    3    5       #  matrix, none of the rows or columns 
   [2,]    2    4    6       #  have names.
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>From two or more vectors of equal length
: Use <TT>cbind()</TT> to
  combine 2
 vectors vertically to form a <!-- MATH
 $k \times n$
 -->
 matrix, 
  or <TT>rbind()</TT> to combine 2
 vectors horizontally to form a
  <!-- MATH
 $n \times k$
 -->

 matrix.  For example:
<PRE>
&gt; x &lt;- c(11, 12, 13)         # Creates a vector `x' of 3 values.
&gt; y &lt;- c(55, 33, 12)         # Creates another vector `y' of 3 values.  
&gt; rbind(x, y)                # Creates a 2 x 3 matrix.  Note that row
     [,1] [,2] [,3]          #  1 is named x and row 2 is named y, 
   x   11   12   13          #  according to the order in which the
   y   55   33   12          #  arguments were passed to rbind().
&gt; cbind(x, y)                # Creates a 3 x 2 matrix.  Note that the
         x  y                #  columns are named according to the
   [1,] 11 55                #  order in which they were passed to
   [2,] 12 33                #  cbind().  
   [3,] 13 12
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>
R supports a variety of matrix functions, including: <br>
<TT>det()</TT>, which returns the matrix's determinant; <br>
<TT>t()</TT>, which transposes the matrix; <br>
<TT>solve()</TT>, which inverts the the matrix; and<br>
<TT>%*%</TT>, which multiplies two matricies.  <br><br>

In addition, the <TT>dim()</TT> command returns the dimensions of your matrix.  <br>
As with vectors, square brackets extract specific values from a matrix and the
assignment mechanism <TT>&lt;-</TT> replaces values.  For example:
<PRE>
&gt; loo[,3]     		  # Extracts the third column of loo.  
&gt; loo[1,]      		  # Extracts the first row of loo.  
&gt; loo[1,3] &lt;- 13          # Inserts 13 as the value for row 1, column 3.  
&gt; loo[1,] &lt;- c(2,2,3)     # Replaces the first row of loo.
</PRE>
If you encounter problems replacing rows or columns, make sure that
the <TT>dims()</TT> of the vector matches the <TT>dims()</TT> of the
matrix you are trying to replace.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An <B>n-dimensional array</B> is a set of stacked matrices of identical
  dimensions.  For example, you may create a three dimensional array by stacking 2
 matrices each with 2  rows and 3 columns.  
<PRE>
&gt; a &lt;- matrix(8, 2, 3)       # Creates a 2 x 3 matrix populated with 8's.
&gt; b &lt;- matrix(9, 2, 3)       # Creates a 2 x 3 matrix populated with 9's.
&gt; array(c(a, b), c(2, 3, 2)) # Creates a 2 x 3 x 2 array with the first
   , , 1                     #  level [,,1] populated with matrix a (8's),
                             #  and the second level [,,2] populated 
        [,1] [,2] [,3]       #  with matrix b (9's).  
   [1,]    8    8    8       
   [2,]    8    8    8       # Use square brackets to extract values.  For
                             #  example, [1, 2, 2] extracts the second
   , , 2                     #  value in the first row of the second level.
                             # You may also use the &lt;- operator to 
        [,1] [,2] [,3]       #  replace values.  
   [1,]    9    9    9
   [2,]    9    9    9
</PRE>
If an array is a one-dimensional vector or two-dimensional matrix, R
  will treat the array using the more specific method.  
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Three functions especially helpful for
arrays:  

<UL>
<LI><TT>is()</TT> returns both the type of scalar value that populates
the array, as well as the specific type of array (vector, matrix, or
array more generally).
</LI>
<LI><TT>dims()</TT> returns the size of an array, where 
<PRE>
&gt; dims(b) 
 [1]  33  5
</PRE> 
indicates that the array is two-dimensional (a matrix), and has 33
rows and 5 columns.  
</LI>
<LI>The single bracket <code>[ ]</code> indicates specific values in the

<h1>How to Create an Array in R</h1>

    <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body p402_premium"><p>You have two different options for constructing matrices or arrays. Either you use the creator functions <span class="code">matrix()</span> and <span class="code">array()</span>, or you simply change the dimensions using the <span class="code">dim()</span> function.</p>
<h2>Use the creator functions in R</h2>
<p>You can create an array easily with the <span class="code">array()</span> function, where you give the data as the first argument and a vector with the sizes of the dimensions as the second argument. The number of dimension sizes in that argument gives you the number of dimensions. For example, you make an array with four columns, three rows, and two &#147;tables&#148; like this:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; my.array &lt;- array(1:24, dim=c(3,4,2))
&gt; my.array
, , 1
   [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]  1  4  7  10
[2,]  2  5  8  11
[3,]  3  6  9  12
, , 2
   [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]  13  16  19  22
[2,]  14  17  20  23
[3,]  15  18  21  24</pre>
<p>This array has three dimensions. Notice that, although the rows are given as the first dimension, the tables are filled column-wise. So, for arrays, R fills the columns, then the rows, and then the rest.</p>
<h2>Change the dimensions of a vector in R</h2>
<p>Alternatively, you could just add the dimensions using the <span class="code">dim()</span> function. This is a little hack that goes a bit faster than using the <span class="code">array()</span> function; it&#8217;s especially useful if you have your data already in a vector. (This little trick also works for creating matrices, by the way, because a matrix is nothing more than an array with only two dimensions.)</p>
<p>Say you already have a vector with the numbers 1 through 24, like this:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; my.vector &lt;- 1:24</pre>
<p>You can easily convert that vector to an array exactly like <span class="code">my.array</span> simply by assigning the dimensions, like this:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; dim(my.vector) &lt;- c(3,4,2)</pre>
<p>If you check how <span class="code">my.vector</span> looks like now, you see there is no difference from the array <span class="code">my.array</span> that you created before.</p>
<p class="Tip">You can check whether two objects are identical by using the <span class="code">identical()</span> function. To check, for example, whether <span class="code">my.vector</span> and <span class="code">my.array</span> are identical, you simply do the following:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt; identical(my.array, my.vector)
[1] TRUE</pre>

</div>
