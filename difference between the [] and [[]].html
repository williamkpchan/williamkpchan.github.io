<h1>difference between the [] and [[]] notations</h1>
<h2>8 Answers</h2>
<p>The R Language Definition is handy for answering these types of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
R has three basic indexing operators, with syntax displayed by the following examples
<p>
<code><pre>
    x[i]
    x[i, j]
    x[[i]]
    x[[i, j]]
    x$a
    x$"a"
</pre></code>
<p>
For vectors and matrices the <code>[[</code> forms are rarely used, although they have some slight semantic differences from the [ form (e.g. it drops any names or dimnames attribute, and that partial matching is used for character indices). When indexing multi-dimensional structures with a single index, <code>x[[i]]</code> or <code>x[i]</code> will return the <code>i</code>th sequential element of <code>x</code>. 
<p>
For lists, one generally uses <code>[[</code> to select any single element, whereas <code>[</code> returns a list of the selected elements. 
<p>
The <code>[[</code> form allows only a single element to be selected using integer or character indices, whereas <code>[</code> allows indexing by vectors. Note though that for a list, the index can be a vector and each element of the vector is applied in turn to the list, the selected component, the selected component of that component, and so on. The result is still a single element.

<p>The significant differences between the two methods are the class of the objects they return when used for extraction and whether they may accept a range of values, or just a single value during assignment.</p>

<p>Consider the case of data extraction on the following list:</p>

<pre><code>foo &lt;- list( str='R', vec=c(1,2,3), bool=TRUE )
</code></pre>

<p>Say we would like to extract the value stored by bool from foo and use it inside an <code>if()</code> statement. This will illustrate the differences between the return values of <code>[]</code> and <code>[[]]</code> when they are used for data extraction. The <code>[]</code> method returns objects of class list (or data.frame if foo was a data.frame) while the <code>[[]]</code> method returns objects whose class is determined by the type of their values. </p>

<p>So, using the <code>[]</code> method results in the following:</p>

<pre><code>if( foo[ 'bool' ] ){ print("Hi!") }
Error in if (foo["bool"]) { : argument is not interpretable as logical

class( foo[ 'bool' ] )
[1] "list"
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the <code>[]</code> method returned a list and a list is not valid object to pass directly into an <code>if()</code> statement. In this case we need to use <code>[[]]</code> because it will return the "bare" object stored in 'bool' which will have the appropriate class:</p>

<pre><code>if( foo[[ 'bool' ]] ){ print("Hi!") }
[1] "Hi!"

class( foo[[ 'bool' ]] )
[1] "logical"
</code></pre>

<p>The second difference is that the <code>[]</code> operator may be used to access a <strong>range</strong> of slots in a list or columns in a data frame while the <code>[[]]</code> operator is limited to accessing a <strong>single</strong> slot or column. Consider the case of value assignment using a second list, <code>bar()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>bar &lt;- list( mat=matrix(0,nrow=2,ncol=2), rand=rnorm(1) )
</code></pre>

<p>Say we want to overwrite the last two slots of foo with the data contained in bar. If we try to use the <code>[[]]</code> operator, this is what happens:</p>

<pre><code>foo[[ 2:3 ]] &lt;- bar
Error in foo[[2:3]] &lt;- bar : 
more elements supplied than there are to replace
</code></pre>

<p>This is because <code>[[]]</code> is limited to accessing a single element. We need to use <code>[]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo[ 2:3 ] &lt;- bar
print( foo )

$str
[1] "R"

$vec
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    0
[2,]    0    0

$bool
[1] -0.6291121
</code></pre>

<p>Note that while the assignment was successful, the slots in foo kept their original names.</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<p>Double brackets accesses a list <strong>element</strong>, while a single bracket gives you back a list with a single element.</p>

<pre><code>lst &lt;- list('one','two','three')

a &lt;- lst[1]
class(a)
## returns "list"

a &lt;- lst[[1]]
class(a)
## returns "character"
</code></pre>
<br><br>

<p><code>[]</code> extracts a list, <code>[[]]</code> extracts elements within the list</p>

<pre><code>alist &lt;- list(c("a", "b", "c"), c(1,2,3,4), c(8e6, 5.2e9, -9.3e7))

str(alist[[1]])
 chr [1:3] "a" "b" "c"

str(alist[1])
List of 1
 $ : chr [1:3] "a" "b" "c"

str(alist[[1]][1])
 chr "a"
</code></pre>
<br><br>

<p>To help newbies navigate through the manual fog, it might be helpful to see the <code>[[ ... ]]</code> notation as a <em>collapsing</em> function - in other words, it is when you just want to 'get the data' from a named vector, list or data frame. It is good to do this if you want to use data from these objects for calculations. These simple examples will illustrate.</p>

<pre><code>(x &lt;- c(x=1, y=2)); x[1]; x[[1]]
(x &lt;- list(x=1, y=2, z=3)); x[1]; x[[1]]
(x &lt;- data.frame(x=1, y=2, z=3)); x[1]; x[[1]]
</code></pre>

<p>So from the third example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; 2 * x[1]
  x
1 2
&gt; 2 * x[[1]]
[1] 2
</code></pre>
<br><br>

<p>Both of them are ways of subsetting.
The single bracket will will return a subset of the list, which in itself will be a list. ie:It may or may not contain more than one elements.
On the other hand a double bracket will return just a single element from the list.</p>

<p>-Single bracket will give us a list. We can also use single bracket if we wish to return multiple elements from the list.
consider the following list:-</p>

<pre><code>&gt;r&lt;-list(c(1:10),foo=1,far=2);
</code></pre>

<p>Now please note the way the list is returned when I try to display it.
I type r and press enter</p>

<pre><code>&gt;r

#the result is:-

[[1]]

 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

$foo

[1] 1

$far

[1] 2
</code></pre>

<p>Now we will see the magic of single bracket:-</p>

<pre><code>&gt;r[c(1,2,3)]

#the above command will return a list with all three elements of the actual list r as below

[[1]]

 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

$foo

[1] 1


$far

[1] 2
</code></pre>

<p>which is exactly the same as when we tried to display value of r on screen, which means the usage of single bracket has returned a list, where at index 1 we have a vector of 10 elements, then we have two more elements with names foo and far.
We may also choose to give a single index or element name as input to the single bracket.
eg:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; r[1]

[[1]]

 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
</code></pre>

<p>In this example we gave one index "1" and in return got a list with one element(which is an array of 10 numbers)</p>

<pre><code>&gt; r[2]

$foo

[1] 1
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example we gave one index "2" and in return got a list with one element</p>

<pre><code>&gt; r["foo"];

$foo

[1] 1
</code></pre>

<p>In this example we passed the name of one element and in return a list was returned with one element.</p>

<p>You may also pass a vector of element names like:-</p>

<pre><code>&gt; x&lt;-c("foo","far")

&gt; r[x];

$foo

[1] 1

$far
[1] 2
</code></pre>

<p>In this example we passed an vector with two element names "foo" and "far"</p>

<p>In return we got a list with two elements.</p>

<p>In short single bracket will always return you another list with number of elements equal to the number of elements or number of indices you pass into the single bracket.</p>

<p>In contrast, a double bracket will always return only one element.
Before moving to double bracket a note to be kept in mind.
<strong><em><code>NOTE:THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT SINGLE BRACKET RETURNS YOU A LIST WITH AS MANY ELEMENTS AS YOU WISH WHILE A DOUBLE BRACKET WILL NEVER RETURN A LIST. RATHER A DOUBLE BRACKET WILL RETURN ONLY A SINGLE ELEMENT FROM THE LIST.</code></em></strong></p>

<p>I will site a few examples. Please keep a note of the words in bold and come back to it after you are done with the examples below:</p>

<p>Double bracket will return you the actual value at the index.(It will <strong>NOT</strong> return a list)</p>

<pre><code>  &gt; r[[1]]

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10


  &gt;r[["foo"]]

    [1] 1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>for double brackets if we try to view more than one elements by passing a vector it will result in an error just because it was not built to cater to that need, but just to return a single element.</strong></p>

<p>Consider the following</p>

<pre><code>&gt; r[[c(1:3)]]
Error in r[[c(1:3)]] : recursive indexing failed at level 2
&gt; r[[c(1,2,3)]]
Error in r[[c(1, 2, 3)]] : recursive indexing failed at level 2
&gt; r[[c("foo","far")]]
Error in r[[c("foo", "far")]] : subscript out of bounds
</code></pre>
<br><br>

<p>For yet another concrete use case, use double brackets when you want to select a data frame created by the <code>split()</code> function. If you don't know, <code>split()</code> groups a list/data frame into subsets based on a key field. It's useful if when you want to operate on multiple groups, plot them, etc.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; class(data)
[1] "data.frame"

&gt; dsplit&lt;-split(data, data$id)
&gt; class(dsplit)
[1] "list"

&gt; class(dsplit['ID-1'])
[1] "list"

&gt; class(dsplit[['ID-1']])
[1] "data.frame"
</code></pre>
<br><br>

<p>Just adding here that <code>[[</code> also is equipped for <em>recursive indexing</em>.</p>

<p>This was hinted at in the answer by @JijoMatthew but not explored.</p>

<p>As noted in <code>?"[["</code>, syntax like <code>x[[y]]</code>, where <code>length(y) &gt; 1</code>, is interpreted as:</p>

<pre><code>x[[ y[1] ]][[ y[2] ]][[ y[3] ]] ... [[ y[length(y)] ]]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this <em>doesn't</em> change what should be your main takeaway on the difference between <code>[</code> and <code>[[</code> -- namely, that the former is used for <strong>subsetting</strong>, and the latter is used for <strong>extracting</strong> single list elements.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- list(list(list(1), 2), list(list(list(3), 4), 5), 6)
x
# [[1]]
# [[1]][[1]]
# [[1]][[1]][[1]]
# [1] 1
#
# [[1]][[2]]
# [1] 2
#
# [[2]]
# [[2]][[1]]
# [[2]][[1]][[1]]
# [[2]][[1]][[1]][[1]]
# [1] 3
#
# [[2]][[1]][[2]]
# [1] 4
#
# [[2]][[2]]
# [1] 5
#
# [[3]]
# [1] 6
</code></pre>

<p>To get the value 3, we can do:</p>

<pre><code>x[[c(2, 1, 1, 1)]]
# [1] 3
</code></pre>

<p>Getting back to @JijoMatthew's answer above, recall <code>r</code>:</p>

<pre><code>r &lt;- list(1:10, foo=1, far=2)
</code></pre>

<p>In particular, this explains the errors we tend to get when mis-using <code>[[</code>, namely:</p>

<pre><code>r[[1:3]]
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in <code>r[[1:3]]</code> : recursive indexing failed at level 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this code actually tried to evaluate <code>r[[1]][[2]][[3]]</code>, and the nesting of <code>r</code> stops at level one, the attempt to extract through recursive indexing failed at <code>[[2]]</code>, i.e., at level 2.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in <code>r[[c("foo", "far")]]</code> : subscript out of bounds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, R was looking for <code>r[["foo"]][["far"]]</code>, which doesn't exist, so we get the subscript out of bounds error.</p>

<p>It probably would be a bit more helpful/consistent if both of these errors gave the same message.</p>
