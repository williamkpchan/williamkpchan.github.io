<h4>LAN IP Address vs WAN IP Address</h4>
              
             <h5>Question</h5>
		<p><i>What is the difference between LAN IP address and WAN IP address 
        of a network device?</i></p>
        
		<h5>Answer</h5>
              
        <p>A network device, i.e. network/LAN adapter, modem, router, access 
        point, can have a single IP address (either LAN&nbsp; or WAN IP address) 
        or two IP addresses (both LAN and WAN IP addresses). To clarify this 
        point, I would like to depict three Internet access scenarios as 
        follows:</p>

        <p>1) A computer connects to Internet via an internal/external modem 
        that has no router functionality.</p>

        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="images/computer-modem-ip-address.gif" width="530" height="90" alt="a computer connected to Internet via a broadband modem." title="a computer connected to Internet via an external broadband modem."></p>

        <p>- This computer IP address is similar with the modem IP address, i.e. a WAN IP 
        address (public IP address) which is assigned by the ISP, such as 
        194.223.19.212.</p>

        <p>2) A computer connects to Internet via an external modem that has 
        router functionality.</p>

        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="images/computer-modem-wan-ip-address.gif" width="530" height="90" alt="a computer connected to Internet via a broadband modem with router functionality." title="a computer connected to Internet via a broadband modem with router functionality."> </p>
        
        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td width="100%" align="center">
            <div style="padding-right: 0px; border-top: #d4d5da 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px 16px; overflow: hidden; width: 468px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #d4d5da 1px solid">

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>- This computer (i.e. the network adapter that 
        connects it to the modem) will have a LAN IP address (private IP 
        address) such as 192.168.1.2.</p>

        <p>- Meanwhile the modem will have a LAN IP 
        address (private gateway IP address) such as 192.168.1.1 toward the connected computers and 
        a WAN IP address (public IP address) toward the ISP. </p>

        <p>3) A computer connects to Internet via a wired/wireless router which 
        in turn connects to Internet via a broadband (DSL/cable/3G/3.5G/4G) 
        modem.</p>

        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="images/computer-modem-router-ip-address.gif" width="710" height="100" alt="a computer connected to Internet via a wired/wireless router and a broadband modem." title="a computer connected to Internet via a wired/wireless router and a broadband modem."></p>

        <p>- This computer (i.e. the network adapter (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) 
        that connects it to the modem) will get a LAN IP address (private IP 
        address) such as 192.168.2.3. </p>

        <p>- The router will have a LAN IP address (private gateway IP address) such as 
        192.168.2.1 and a WAN IP address (also a private IP address) such as 
        192.168.1.2. </p>

        <p>- The broadband modem which borders the LAN 
        (home/company/organization network) with the WAN (Internet) will have a 
        LAN IP address (private gateway IP address) such as 192.168.1.1 and a WAN IP 
        address (public IP address) toward the ISP.</p>

        <p>The breakdown on configuration number 2 or 3 above also applies if this 
        computer is an ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) client that connects to 
        Internet via an ICS host because the ICS host acts as a router.</p>

        <p>You can check your computer IP address and find out which network 
        card or adapter that connects you to the Internet by typing 
        <a href="computer-ip-address.htm" onClick="return popmeup('computer-ip-address.htm')"><strong>ipconfig /all</strong></a> on the Command Prompt. To check your 
        <a href="modem-router-ip-address.htm" onClick="return popmeup('modem-router-ip-address.htm')">modem</a> or <a href="gateway-router-ip-address.htm" onClick="return popmeup('gateway-router-ip-address.htm')">router</a> LAN and WAN IP addresses, you can type its pre-defined 
        address on a browser (IE, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, etc.) address bar, 
        e.g. <strong>http://192.168.1.1</strong> and see the connection details 
        usually on a Home/Status page.</p>
