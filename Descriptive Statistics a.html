<h1>Descriptive Statistics</h1>
      </div>
      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" --><p>Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study.
They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together with simple
graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data.</p>

<p>Descriptive statistics are typically distinguished from <a href="statinf.php">inferential
statistics</a>. With descriptive statistics you are simply describing what is or what the
data shows. With inferential statistics, you are trying to reach conclusions that extend
beyond the immediate data alone. For instance, we use inferential statistics to try to
infer from the sample data what the population might think. Or, we use inferential
statistics to make judgments of the probability that an observed difference between groups
is a dependable one or one that might have happened by chance in this study. Thus, we use
inferential statistics to make inferences from our data to more general conditions; we use
descriptive statistics simply to describe what's going on in our data.</p>

<p>Descriptive Statistics are used to present quantitative descriptions in a manageable
form. In a research study we may have lots of measures. Or we may measure a large number
of people on any measure. Descriptive statistics help us to simplify large amounts of data
in a sensible way. Each descriptive statistic reduces lots of data into a simpler summary.
For instance, consider a simple number used to summarize how well a batter is performing
in baseball, the batting average. This single number is simply the number of hits divided
by the number of times at bat (reported to three significant digits). A batter who is
hitting .333 is getting a hit one time in every three at bats. One batting .250 is hitting
one time in four. The single number describes a large number of discrete events. Or,
consider the scourge of many students, the Grade Point Average (GPA). This single number
describes the general performance of a student across a potentially wide range of course
experiences. </p>

<p>Every time you try to describe a large set of observations with a single indicator you
run the risk of distorting the original data or losing important detail. The batting
average doesn't tell you whether the batter is hitting home runs or singles. It doesn't
tell whether she's been in a slump or on a streak. The GPA doesn't tell you whether the
student was in difficult courses or easy ones, or whether they were courses in their major
field or in other disciplines. Even given these limitations, descriptive statistics
provide a powerful summary that may enable comparisons across people or other units.</p>

<h2>Univariate Analysis</h2>

<p>Univariate analysis involves the examination across cases of one variable at a time.
There are three major characteristics of a single variable that we tend to look at:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the distribution </li>
	<li>the central tendency </li>
	<li>the dispersion </li>
</ul>

<p>In most situations, we would describe all three of these characteristics for each of
the variables in our study.</p>

<p><strong>The Distribution.</strong> The distribution is a summary of the frequency of
individual values or ranges of values for a variable. The simplest distribution would list
every value of a variable and the number of persons who had each value. For instance, a
typical way to describe the distribution of college students is by year in college,
listing the number or percent of students at each of the four years. Or, we describe
gender by listing the number or percent of males and females. In these cases, the variable
has few enough values that we can list each one and summarize how many sample cases had
the value. But what do we do for a variable like income or GPA? With these variables there
can be a large number of possible values, with relatively few people having each one. In
this case, we group the raw scores into categories according to ranges of values. For
instance, we might look at GPA according to the letter grade ranges. Or, we might group
income into four or five ranges of income values.</p>

<table CELLPADDING="10" CELLSPACING="10">

    <td><p align="center"><img src="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/Assets/images/statdes1.gif" width="209" height="142"><br>
    <font SIZE="-1">Table 1. Frequency distribution table.</font> </td>

</table>
</center></div>

<p>One of the most common ways to describe a single variable is with a <font COLOR="#006600"><strong><em>frequency distribution</em></strong></font>. Depending on the particular
variable, all of the data values may be represented, or you may group the values into
categories first (e.g., with age, price, or temperature variables, it would usually not be
sensible to determine the frequencies for each value. Rather, the value are grouped into
ranges and the frequencies determined.). Frequency distributions can be depicted in two
ways, as a table or as a graph. Table 1 shows an age frequency distribution with five
categories of age ranges defined. The same frequency distribution can be depicted in a
graph as shown in Figure 1. This type of graph is often referred to as a <font COLOR="#006600">histogram</font> or <font COLOR="#006600">bar chart</font>. </p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table CELLPADDING="10" CELLSPACING="10">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="center"><img src="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/Assets/images/statdes2.gif" width="277" height="215"><br>
    <font SIZE="-1">Figure 1. Frequency distribution bar chart.</font> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>Distributions may also be displayed using percentages. For example, you could use
percentages to describe the: </p>

<ul>
	<li>percentage of people in different income levels </li>
	<li>percentage of people in different age ranges </li>
	<li>percentage of people in different ranges of standardized test scores 
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Central Tendency.</strong> The central tendency of a distribution is an
estimate of the "center" of a distribution of values. There are three major
types of estimates of central tendency:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mean </li>
	<li>Median </li>
	<li>Mode </li>
</ul>

<p>The <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>Mean</strong></font> or average is probably the most commonly
used method of describing central tendency. To compute the mean all you do is add up all
the values and divide by the number of values. For example, the mean or average quiz score
is determined by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of students taking the
exam. For example, consider the test score values:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>15, 20, 21, 20, 36, 15, 25, 15</strong></p>

<p>The sum of these 8 values is 167, so the mean is 167/8 = 20.875.</p>

<p>The <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>Median</strong></font> is the score found at the exact middle
of the set of values. One way to compute the median is to list all scores in numerical
order, and then locate the score in the center of the sample. For example, if there are
500 scores in the list, score #250 would be the median. If we order the 8 scores shown
above, we would get:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>15,15,15,20,20,21,25,36</strong></p>

<p>There are 8 scores and score #4 and #5 represent the halfway point. Since both of these
scores are 20, the median is 20. If the two middle scores had different values, you would
have to interpolate to determine the median.</p>

<p>The <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>mode</strong></font> is the most frequently occurring value in
the set of scores. To determine the mode, you might again order the scores as shown above,
and then count each one. The most frequently occurring value is the mode. In our example,
the value 15 occurs three times and is the model. In some distributions there is more than
one modal value. For instance, in a bimodal distribution there are two values that occur
most frequently.</p>

<p>Notice that for the same set of 8 scores we got three different values -- 20.875, 20,
and 15 -- for the mean, median and mode respectively. If the distribution is truly normal
(i.e., bell-shaped), the mean, median and mode are all equal to each other.</p>

<p><a NAME="Dispersion"></a><strong>Dispersion.</strong> Dispersion refers to the spread
of the values around the central tendency. There are two common measures of dispersion,
the range and the standard deviation. The <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>range</strong></font> is
simply the highest value minus the lowest value. In our example distribution, the high
value is 36 and the low is 15, so the range is 36 - 15 = 21.</p>

<p>The <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>Standard Deviation</strong></font> is a more accurate and
detailed estimate of dispersion because an outlier can greatly exaggerate the range (as
was true in this example where the single outlier value of 36 stands apart from the rest
of the values. The Standard Deviation shows the relation that set of scores has to the
mean of the sample. Again lets take the set of scores:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>15,20,21,20,36,15,25,15</strong></p>

<p>to compute the standard deviation, we first find the distance between each value and
the mean. We know from above that the mean is 20.875. So, the differences from the mean
are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>15 - 20.875 = -5.875<br>
    20 - 20.875 = -0.875<br>
    21 - 20.875 = +0.125<br>
    20 - 20.875 = -0.875<br>
    36 - 20.875 = 15.125<br>
    15 - 20.875 = -5.875<br>
    25 - 20.875 = +4.125<br>
    15 - 20.875 = -5.875<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that values that are below the mean have negative discrepancies and values above
it have positive ones. Next, we square each discrepancy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>-5.875 * -5.875 = 34.515625<br>
    -0.875 * -0.875 = 0.765625<br>
    +0.125 * +0.125 = 0.015625<br>
    -0.875 * -0.875 = 0.765625<br>
    15.125 * 15.125 = 228.765625<br>
    -5.875 * -5.875 = 34.515625<br>
    +4.125 * +4.125 = 17.015625<br>
    -5.875 * -5.875 = 34.515625<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we take these "squares" and sum them to get the Sum of Squares (SS)
value. Here, the sum is 350.875. Next, we divide this sum by the number of scores minus 1.
Here, the result is 350.875 / 7 = 50.125. This value is known as the <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>variance</strong></font>.
To get the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance (remember that we
squared the deviations earlier). This would be SQRT(50.125) = 7.079901129253.</p>

<p>Although this computation may seem convoluted, it's actually quite simple. To see this,
consider the formula for the standard deviation:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/Assets/images/statdes3.gif" width="474" height="300"></p>

<p>In the top part of the ratio, the numerator, we see that each score has the the mean
subtracted from it, the difference is squared, and the squares are summed. In the bottom
part, we take the number of scores minus 1. The ratio is the variance and the square root
is the standard deviation. In English, we can describe the standard deviation as:</p>

<p align="center"><font COLOR="#0000FF"><strong>the square root of the sum of the squared
deviations from the mean divided by the number of scores minus one</strong></font></p>

<p>Although we can calculate these univariate statistics by hand, it gets quite tedious
when you have more than a few values and variables. Every statistics program is capable of
calculating them easily for you. For instance, I put the eight scores into SPSS and got
the following table as a result:</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table BORDER="1">
  <tr>
    <td>N</td>
    <td align="right">8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mean</td>
    <td align="right">20.8750</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Median</td>
    <td align="right">20.0000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mode</td>
    <td align="right">15.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Std. Deviation</td>
    <td align="right">7.0799</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Variance</td>
    <td align="right">50.1250</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Range</td>
    <td align="right">21.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>which confirms the calculations I did by hand above.</p>

<p>The standard deviation allows us to reach some conclusions about specific scores in our
distribution. Assuming that the distribution of scores is normal or bell-shaped (or close
to it!), the following conclusions can be reached:</p>

<ul>
	<li>approximately 68% of the scores in the sample fall within one standard deviation of the
    mean </li>
	<li>approximately 95% of the scores in the sample fall within two standard deviations of the
    mean </li>
	<li>approximately 99% of the scores in the sample fall within three standard deviations of
    the mean </li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, since the mean in our example is 20.875 and the standard deviation is
7.0799, we can from the above statement estimate that approximately 95% of the scores will
fall in the range of 20.875-(2*7.0799) to 20.875+(2*7.0799) or between 6.7152 and 35.0348.
This kind of information is a critical stepping stone to enabling us to compare the
performance of an individual on one variable with their performance on another, even when
the variables are measured on entirely different scales. </p>
