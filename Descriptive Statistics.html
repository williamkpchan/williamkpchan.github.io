<p class="firstp"> <span class="term">Descriptive statistics</span> 
  are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data.<br>
   The word &quot;data&quot; refers to the information that has been 
collected from an experiment, a survey, a historical record, 
etc.<br>
 (By the way, &quot;data&quot; is plural.<br>
 One piece of information is called a &quot;datum.<br>
&quot;) If we are analyzing birth certificates, 
for example, a descriptive statistic might be the percentage of 
certificates issued in New York State, or the average age of the 
mother.<br>
 Any other number we choose to compute also counts as a 
descriptive statistic for the <a href="javaScript:glossary('data')" title = "Definition in a new window.
" class="term">data</a> from which the statistic is 
computed.
 Several descriptive statistics are often used at one 
time to give a full picture of the data.
</p>
   <p class="para">Descriptive statistics are just descriptive.
    They 
    do not involve <span class="emphasis">generalizing</span> beyond 
    the data at hand. Generalizing from our data to another set of 
cases is the business of <a href="javaScript:glossary('inferential_statistics')" title = "Definition in a new window.
" class="term">inferential 
statistics</a>, which you'll be studying in another <a href="inferential.
html">section</a>.

Here we focus on (mere) descriptive statistics.
</p>
   <p class="para">Some descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1.

    The table shows the average salaries for various occupations in 
    the United States in 1999.

<p class="firstp">Descriptive statistics like these offer insight 
  into American society. It is interesting to note, for example, 
  that we pay the people who educate our children and who protect 
our citizens a great deal less than we pay people who take care 
of our feet or our teeth.</p>
   <p class="para"> For more descriptive statistics, consider Table
     2 which shows the number of unmarried men per 100 unmarried women
  in U.S. Metro Areas in 1990. From this table we see that men
  outnumber
  women most in Jacksonville, NC, and women outnumber
me<span class="para">n 
most in Sarasota, FL. You can see that descriptive statistics
 can be useful if we are looking for an opposite-sex partner!

 data come from the Information
 Please Almanac.</span>)</p>

   <p class="firstp">These descriptive statistics may make us ponder 
    why the numbers are so disparate in these cities. One potential 
  explanation, for instance, as to why there are more women in Florida 
than men may involve the fact that elderly individuals tend to 
move down to the Sarasota region and that women tend to outlive 
men. Thus, more women might live in Sarasota than men. However, 
in the absence of proper data, this is only speculation.</p>
   <p class="para">You probably know that descriptive 
    statistics are central to the world of sports. Every sporting 
    event produces numerous statistics such as the shooting percentage 
of players on a basketball team. For the Olympic marathon (a foot 
race of 26.2 miles), we possess data that cover more than a century 
of competition. (The first modern Olympics took place in 1896.) 
The following table shows the winning times for both men and women 
(the latter have only been allowed to compete since 1984).<br>

  <p class="firstp">There are many descriptive statistics that we
   can compute from the data in the table. To gain insight into
   the
   improvement in speed over the years, let us divide the men's
times
into two pieces, namely, the first 13 races (up to 1952)
and the
second 13 (starting from 1956). The mean winning
time for the
first 13 races is 2 hours, 44 minutes, and 22 seconds
(written 2:44:22).
The mean winning time for the second 13
races is 2:13:18. This
is quite a difference (over half an hour).
Does this prove that
the fastest men are running faster? Or
is the difference just
due to chance, no more than what often
emerges from chance differences
in performance from year to
year? We can't answer this question
with descriptive statistics
alone. All we can affirm is that the
two means are &quot;suggestive.&quot;</p>

<p class="para">Examining Table 3 leads to many other questions. 
  We note that Takahashi (the lead female runner in 2000) would 
  have beaten the male runner in 1956 and all male runners in the 
first 12 marathons. This fact leads us to ask whether the gender 
gap will close or remain constant. When we look at the times within 
each gender, we also wonder how much they will decrease (if at 
all) in the next century of the Olympics. Might we one day witness 
a sub-2 hour marathon? The study of statistics can help you make 
reasonable guesses about the answers to these questions.</p>
