Open a folder with .bat

start "c:\Yaya\yoyo\"

%SystemRoot%\explorer.exe "c:\Yaya\yoyo\"

explorer c:/Yaya/yoyo

The start command needs blank quotes at the beginning, as it uses the first double quoted phrase as the "Window title"

start "" "c:\Yaya\yoyo\"



BAT file to map to network drive without running as admin

@echo off

net use Z: \\server\SharedFolderName password /user:domain\Username /persistent:yes

/persistent:yes flag will tell the computer to automatically reconnect this share on logon. Otherwise, you need to run the script again during each boot to map the drive.

For Example:

net use Z: \\WindowsServer123\g$ P@ssw0rd /user:Mynetdomain\Sysadmin /persistent:yes

net use P: "\\server\foldername\foldername"



If you don't to map a network drive with net use you can access a UNC Path directly from the Command Prompt using pushd.

For example:

pushd \\server\share


Suggestion:
map the path as a drive and set auto mapping when start windows

and then open as normal drive using stert or explorer
