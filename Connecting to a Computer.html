<font><b>Connecting through the 
Internet to a Home / SOHO Computer / Server.&nbsp;  </b>Or How Do I find&nbsp;My Network on the Internet?</font></p>

<p>
<span>In order to log to an Internet site/server you need a valid address. Such an 
address might be the IP number (like http://207.46.250.222), a name like www.ezlan.net or http://jack.dns-ip.com</span></p>
<p>
<span>This page will describe few options to enable you to use any Internet 
connection in the world to connect to your Home/SOHO Network/Server.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>
<span>Your system has to be prepared to accept a connection from 
the outside.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>
<font>If the Serving system is behind a 
Router or and Firewall the Ports that are associated with the serving 
applications have to be opened through both Firewalls. (<a target="_blank" href="routers1.html">Opening 
Ports</a>).</font></p>

<hr>
<p>
<span>If you would like to <b>Remotely Control</b> your Computers you have to install a Remote Control program. </span></p>
<p>
<span>Example: </span><font style="font-size: 10pt" face="Tahoma">

<p>
<span>If you would to run a sever and make it available through the Internet</span><font size="2"> you have 
to configure a functional Server on one of your computers.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>
<font size="2">You can run&nbsp; HTTP, FTP, Email, or any other regular server, the methods describe bellow will fit all of them.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2">If you are Not familiar with Server installation, you might Start with some thing modest like&nbsp; this: </font>

<p>
<font>On IPs.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">When using Internet connection and LAN in a regular home setting, there are two kinds of IP 
Numbers that are assigned to your Network..<br>
<br>
1. External IP (WAN IP).&nbsp; This is the IP that your ISP assigns to you to use the Internet.<br>
<br>
2.  Internal IP (LAN IP).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the IPs assigned to your LAN's computers (the 192.168.xxx.xxx type).<br>
<br>
If you need more info about IPs and How to find them.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">To connect to your Computer/Server from the outside there is a need to know your
<b>External IP Address.</b></font></p>

<hr>

<p align="left"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Option 1 - Static IP.</span></b></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">If you have a static IP it 
is very simple since your External IP number is always the same. Any one can connect to your system, all they have to do is to 
type your IP number into their Internet Browser Address Bar. Example:&nbsp; http://168.143.107.163</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">Let recap. I have a static 
WAN IP (fake example): http://168.143.107.163</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">One of my Network's computer 
at home run Simple server with files as described in the Simple Server link above.&nbsp; I am in my hotel in Vegas and I need a 
file.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">I connect my Laptop to the 
Hotel's Internet connection. I start the Browser (I.E.) and type into the address bar http://168.143.107.163 
that it, if set correctly my I will see my files on the screen.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><font>Unfortunately, almost all low cost Broadband Internet connections are Dynamic. I.e. they change often 
according to the ISP preferences.</font></p>

<hr>

<p>
<span>Option 2 - Email me my valid IP address.</span></p>

<p>
<span>If you just 
want to contact your computer by yourself and you have an access to your email from any place with Internet connection.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma">
<span style="font-size: 10pt">Get this free program. This nice program would email your 
Network/Server Current External IP to an email address of your choice:
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lowrieweb.com/dynamicip.htm">dynamicIP</a></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Install it on 
one of your computers, and it will  periodically send an email to your email address telling you what is the current 
External IP.&nbsp; Type the IP to the address bar of any Internet connection in the world and you will get 
to your  system (provided you
<a target="_blank" href="routers1.html">Opened the Ports</a> 
to the specific Computer through your Firewalls, and left the system running).</span></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>Let recap this One.</b>&nbsp; 
My Internet Connection WAN IP&nbsp; is of the dynamic type.&nbsp; I set dynamicIP 
program to check every 10 minutes email to my WebMail address (<a href="mailto:example:%20jack@gmail.com">example: jack@gmail.com</a>) 
if the number changed from the previous reading.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">I am in my hotel in Vegas 
and I need a file that is residing on my office server. I log to the Internet, I log to my Gmail account, I see the email with my current WAN IP.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">
I copy IP number, and paste it to the Browser (I.E.) address bar. If set correctly I would see the files that are on my home server 
and would be able to download the file of my choice.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font>
<a name="dns"></a>Option 3 - 
Dynamic DNS Service.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">You do not want to be 
bothered with the above email process, and or you would like to make your Computer/Server/Network to be available through the 
Internet.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 20; text-align:left">
<span>Use a DNS Service. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">DNS= Domain Name Servers are Data Bases spread all over the Internet telling the system what is the current address of the server 
that you are Trying to reach.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black; font-weight: 700">The DNS services would provide you with personal service to Route your Dynamic address to a permanent presence on the Internet.</span></p>
<p>
<span>These services (</span><font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-size: 10pt">some 
of them are Free) will provide you with a small Client program that should be installed on your server computer. This program 
will detect changes in your WAN IP and would automatically send the current External IP to the DNS Service.&nbsp; 
<br>
When someone wants to connect to your server and use your Internet address they actually 
connect to your permanent personal address with the DNS service, and the service redirect the traffic to your current 
IP of your Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<b>Example:</b> I subscribed to the Free DNS service <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myip.us/">myip.us</a> as &quot;jack&quot;. My 
assigned Internet address would be <b>http://jack.myip.us</b> 
(notice <b>no www</b> since jack&nbsp; is sub domain of <a href="http://www.myip.us/">www.myip.us</a>).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">Given this setting my Home Server can be reached from every place on the Internet by typing
</font><font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
into the Browser Address Bar:
<a href="http://jack.myip.us/">http://jack.myip.us</a>&nbsp; </span></font></p>

List of DNS Services.</a> </span></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
<br>
<b>Column 1 - Sub Domains.</b>&nbsp; It means that you <b>do not</b> have to buy any Internet Domain (as an example www.ezlan.net is a name of a 
domain).&nbsp; Your Domain becomes a sub domain of the service.<br>
<br>
Example: If you subscribe to the DNS service www.myip.us as &quot;jack&quot; your Internet address would be <b>http://jack.myip.us</b> 
(notice <b>no www</b> since it is sub domain of www.myip.us).<br>
<br>
<b>Column 2 - Custom Domain.</b> The DNS service might be free but it requires you to buy a Domain before you start to use the 
service.&nbsp; The cost of a Domain is about $7-$15 per year.  <br>
When using Custom Domain, the DNS service will provide the redirection service but your Internet 
address will be your domain.&nbsp; I.e. if you bought the Domain <b>www.jack.com</b> any one who types www.jack.com into their 
browser will be Routed to your Server.<a name="domain"></a></span></font></p>
<hr>
<p align="center">
<font face="Tahoma" color="#DE3D0E"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight:700">
If you buy a Domain make sure that it is actually yours and that you can host the domain on any server of your 
choice.<br>
Some inexpensive domain vendors make their income from insisting that your Web Site has to be on their fee for service Hosting 
system and you have to pay Extra if you move your Web Site to be Hosted by another vendor.</span></font></p>
<hr>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>Do not buy a Domain that does not provide you with On Line Domain Controller.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 20; text-align:left">
<span>If there is No online Domain Controller you 
are at the merci of the support practice of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Domain Vendor.</span></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 10pt">
<b>What is a Domain Controller?</b><br>
<br>
It is a link to a page in the site of your Domain Vendor that allows you (with an adequate password) to control on line all the 
aspects involving your domain<br>
<b>Including, Ownership, Hosting DNS, etc.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10pt">Since it is available Online you do not need to contact the vendor's support system to make changes 
to your domain settings.</span></i></font></p>

Check your contract with your ISP running certain type of servers might be a violation of you Term of Service (TOS). </span></font></p>
