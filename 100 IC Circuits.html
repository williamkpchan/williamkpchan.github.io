INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>

This is the third part of our Circuits e-book series. <br>
<br>

It contains a further 100 circuits. <br>
<br>

This time we have concentrated on circuits containing one or more IC's. <br>
<br>

It's amazing what you can do with transistors but when Integrated 
Circuits came along, the whole field of electronics exploded. <br>
<br>

IC's can handle both analogue as well as digital signals but before 
their arrival, nearly all circuits were analogue or very simple 
&quot;digital&quot; switching circuits.<br>
<br>

Let's explain what we mean. <br>
<br>

The word analogue is a waveform or signal that is changing 
(increasing and decreasing) at a constant or non constant rate. Examples 
are voice, music, tones, sounds and frequencies. Equipment such as 
radios, TV's and amplifiers process analogue signals. <br>
<br>

Then digital came along. <br>
<br>

Digital is similar to a switch turning something on and off. <br>
<br>

The advantage of digital is two-fold. <br>
<br>

Firstly it is a very reliable and accurate way to send a signal. The 
signal is either HIGH or LOW (ON or OFF). It cannot be half-on or 
one quarter-off. <br>
<br>

And secondly, a circuit that is ON, consumes the least amount of energy 
in the controlling device. In other words, a transistor that is fully 
turned ON and driving a motor, dissipates the least amount of heat. If 
it is slightly turned ON or nearly fully turned ON, it gets very hot.
<br>
<br>

And obviously a transistor that is not turned on at all will consume no 
energy. <br>
<br>

A transistor that turns ON fully and OFF fully is called a SWITCH. <br>
<br>

When two transistors are cross-coupled in the form of a flip flop, any 
pulses entering the circuit cause it to flip and flop and the output 
goes HIGH on every second pulse. This means the circuit halves the input 
pulses and is the basis of counting or dividing. It is also the basis of 
a &quot;Memory Cell&quot; as will will hold a piece of information.<br>
<br>

Digital circuits also introduce the concept of two inputs creating a 
HIGH output when both are HIGH and variations of this. <br>
<br>

This is called &quot;logic&quot; and introduces terms such as &quot;Boolean algebra&quot; 
(Boolean logic) and &quot;gates.&quot; <br>
<br>

Integrated Circuits started with a few transistors in each &quot;chip&quot; and 
increased to mini or micro computers in a single chip. These chips 
are called Microcontrollers and a single chip with a few surrounding 
components can be programmed to play games, monitor heart-rate and do 
all sorts of amazing things. Because they can process information at 
high speed, the end result can appear to have intelligence and this is 
where we are heading: 
AI
 (Artificial Intelligence). <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

In this 
IC Circuits ebook
, we have presented about 100 interesting 
circuits using Integrated Circuits. <br>
<br>

In most cases the IC will contain 10 - 100 transistors, cost less than 
the individual components and take up much less board-space. They also 
save a lot of circuit designing and quite often consume less current 
than discrete components or the components they replace. <br>
<br>

In all, they are a fantastic way to get something working with the least 
componentry. <br>
<br>

A list of of some of the most common Integrated Circuits (Chips) is provided at the end of this 
book to help you identify the pins and show you what is inside the chip.
<br>
<br>

Some of the circuits are available from Talking Electronics as a kit, 
but others will have to be purchased as individual components from your 
local electronics store.
Electronics is such an enormous field that we cannot provide kits for 
everything. But if you have a query about one of the circuits, you can 
contact me.<br>

To save space we have not provided lengthy explanations of how the 
circuits work. This has already been covered in TALKING ELECTRONICS 
Basic Electronics Course, and can be obtained on a

MORE INTRO<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

We have said this before abut we will say it again: 
There are two ways to learn electronics. 

 <br>
<br>

One is to go to school and study theory for 4 years and come out with 
all the theoretical knowledge in the world but very little practical 
experience. The other is to &quot;learn on the job.&quot;<br>
<br>

I am not saying one approach is better than the other but most electronics 
enthusiasts are not &quot;book worms&quot; and many have been dissuaded 
from entering electronics due to the complex mathematics surrounding 
University-type courses. <br>
<br>

Our method is to get around this by advocating designing, building, 
constructions and even more assembly with lots of experimenting and when 
you get stuck with a mathematical problem, get some advice or read about 
it via the thousands of free test books on the web. <br>
<br>

Anyone can succeed in this field by 
applying themselves to constructing 
projects. You actually learn 10 times faster by doing it yourself and we 
have had lots of examples of designs from students in the early stages 
of their career. <br>
<br>

And don't think the experts get it right the first time. Look at all the 
recalled electronics equipment from the early days.<br>
<br>

The most amazing inventions have come from almost &quot;newcomers&quot; as 
evidenced by looking through the &quot;New Inventions&quot; website. <br>
<br>

All you have to do is see a path for your ideas and have a goal that you 
can add your ideas to the &quot;Word of Invention&quot; and you succeed.<br>
<br>

Nothing succeeds like success. And if you have a flair for designing 
things, electronics will provide you a comfortable living for the rest of your 
life. <br>
<br>

The market is very narrow 
but new designs are coming along all the time and new devices 
are constantly being invented and more are always needed. <br>
<br>

Once you get past this eBook of &quot;Chips&quot; you will want to 
investigate microcontrollers and this is when your options will explode.
<br>
<br>

You will be able to carry out tasks you never thought possible, with a 
chip as small as 8 pins and a few hundred lines of code. <br>
<br>

In two weeks you can start to understand the programming code for a 
microcontroller and perform simple tasks such as flashing a LED and 
produce sounds and outputs via the press of a button. <br>
<br>

All these things are covered on
<a href="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/">
Talking Electronics website</a>
 
and you don't have to buy any books or publications. Everything is 
available on the web and it is instantly accessible. That's the beauty 
of the web. <br>
<br>

Don't think things are greener on the other side of the fence, by buying 
a text book. They aren't. Everything you need is on the web AT NO COST.
<br>
<br>

The only thing you have to do is build things. If you have any 
technical problem at all, simply email
<a href="mailto:talking@tpg.com.au?subject=Ask Colin Mitchell any technical question">

Colin Mitchell</a>
 and any question will be answered. Nothing could be 
simpler and this way we guarantee you SUCCESS. Hundreds of readers have 
already emailed and after 5 or more emails, their circuit works. That's 
the way we work. One thing at a time and eventually the fault is found.
<br>
<br>

If you think a circuit will work the first time it is turned on, you are 
fooling yourself. <br>
<br>

All circuits need corrections and improvements and that's what makes a 
good electronics person.Don't give up. How do you think all 
the circuits in these eBooks were designed?
Some were copied and some were designed from scratch but all had to be 
built and adjusted slightly to make sure they worked perfectly.
<br>
<br>

I don't care if you use bread-board, copper strips, matrix board or 
solder the components in the air as a &quot;bird's nest.&quot; You only learn when the 
circuit gets turned on and WORKS!<br>
<br>

In fact the rougher you build something, the more you will guarantee it will 
work when built on a printed circuit board. <br>
<br>

However, high-frequency circuits (such as 100MHz FM Bugs) do not 
like open layouts and you have to keep the construction as tight as 
possible to get them to operate reliably. <br>
<br>

In most other cases, the layout is not critical. <br>
<br>

If you just follow these ideas, you will succeed. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

A few of the basics are also provided in this eBook, the first is 
transistor outlines:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


TRANSISTORS<br>
<br>


 Most of the transistors 
used in our circuits are BC 547 and BC 557. These are classified as 
&quot;universal&quot; or &quot;common&quot; NPN and PNP types with a voltage rating of about 
25v, 100mA collector current and a gain of about 100. <br>
<br>

You can use almost any type of transistor to replace them and here is a list of 
the equivalents and pinouts:<br>

THE 555

<br>
<br>



The 555 is everywhere. It is possibly 
the most-frequency used chip and is easy to use. <br>
<br>

But if you want to use it in a &quot;one-shot&quot; or similar circuit, you 
need to know how the chip will &quot;sit.&quot; <br>
<br>

For this you need to know about the UPPER THRESHOLD (pin 6) 
and LOWER THRESHOLD (pin 2):<br>
<br>

The 555 is fully covered in a 3 page article on Talking Electronics website (see left index: 
555 P1 P2 P3) <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Here is the pin identification for each pin:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

When drawing a circuit diagram, always draw the 555 as a building 
block with the pins in the following locations. This will help you 
instantly recognise the
function of each pin: <br>
<br>

<br>

Note: Pin 7 is &quot;in phase&quot; with 
output 
Pin 3 (both are low at the same time).<br>
<br>

Pin 7 &quot;shorts&quot; to 0v via the transistor. It is pulled HIGH via R1.
<br>
<br>

Maximum supply voltage 16v - 18v<br>
<br>

Current consumption approx 10mA<br>
<br>

Output Current sink @5v = 5 - 50mA @15v = 
50mA<br>
<br>

Output Current source @5v = 100mA @15v = 
200mA<br>
<br>

Maximum operating frequency 
300kHz - 500kHz<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Faults with Chip:
<br>
<br>

Consumes about 10mA when sitting in circuit<br>
<br>

Output voltage up to 2.5v 
less than rail voltage <br>
<br>

Output is 0.5v to 1.5v above ground
<br>
<br>

Sources up to 200mA but sinks only 50mA<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



HOW TO USE THE 555
<br>
<br>

There are many ways to use the 55. <br>
<br>

(a) Astable Multivibrator - constantly oscillates <br>
<br>

(b) Monostable - changes state only once per trigger pulse - 
also called a ONE SHOT<br>
<br>

(c) Voltage Controlled Oscillator 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR
<br>
<br>


The output frequency of a 555 
can be worked out from the following graph:<br>
<br>

<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/555AstableGraph.gif" width="408" height="350">
<br>
<br>

The graph applies to the following Astable circuit:
<table>

<tr>

<td width="220">

</td>

<td>
The capacitor C charges via 
R1 and R2 and when the voltage on the capacitor reaches 2/3 
of the supply, pin 6 detects this and pin 7 connects to 0v. 
The capacitor discharges through R2 until its voltage is 1/3 
of the supply and pin 2 detects this and turns off pin7 to 
repeat the cycle. <br>
<br>

The top resistor is included to prevent pin 7 being damaged 
as it shorts to 0v when pin 6 detects 2/3 rail voltage. <br>
<br>

Its resistance is small compared to R2 and does not come 
into the timing of the oscillator.
</td>

</tr>

</table>




Using the graph:
<br>
<br>

Suppose R1 = 1k, R2 = 10k and C = 0.1 (100n).<br>
<br>

Using the formula on the graph, the total resistance = 1 + 10 + 10 = 21k <br>
<br>

The scales on the graph are logarithmic so that 21k is approximately 
near the &quot;1&quot; on the 10k. Draw a line parallel to the lines on the 
graph and where it crosses the 0.1u line, is the answer. The result 
is approx 900Hz. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Suppose R1 = 10k, R2 = 100k and C = 1u<br>
<br>

Using the formula on the graph, the total resistance = 10 + 100 + 100 = 210k <br>
<br>

The scales on the graph are logarithmic so that 210k is approximately 
near the first &quot;0&quot; on the 100k. Draw a line parallel to the lines on the 
graph and where it crosses the 1u line, is the answer. The result 
is approx 9Hz. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

The frequency of an astable circuit can also be worked out from the 
following formula:

If the capacitor is replaced with an electrolytic, the frequency of 
oscillation will reduce. When the frequency is less than 1Hz, the 
oscillator circuit is called a timer or &quot;delay circuit.&quot; The 555 
will produce delays as long as 30 minutes but with long delays, the 
timing is not accurate.<br>

555 ASTABLE 
OSCILLATORS
<br>
<br>

Here are circuits that operate from 300kHz to 30 minutes:<br>
<br>

(300kHz is the absolute maximum as the 555 starts to malfunction 
with irregular bursts of pulses at this high frequency and 30 
minutes is about the longest you can guarantee the cycle will repeat.)<br>

KNOCK KNOCK DOORBELL
<br>
<br>

This very clever circuit only produces an output when the piezo 
detects two taps. It can be used as a knock-knock doorbell. A 
PC board containing all components (soldered to the board) is available from talking electronics for $5.00 plus 
postage.

</a>

for details. <br>
<br>

The circuit takes only a few microamp and when a tap is detected by 
the piezo, the waveform from the transistor produces a HIGH on pin 6 
and the HIGH on pin 5 makes output pin 4 go low. This very quickly 
charges the 47n and it is discharged via the 560k to produce a brief 
pulse at pin 3. <br>
<br>

The 47n is mainly to stop noise entering pin 2. Pin 1 is HIGH via 
the 2M7 and the LOW on pin 2 causes pin 3 to produce a HIGH pulse. 
The 47n is discharged via the internal diodes on pin 13 and when it 
goes LOW, pin 11 goes HIGH and charges the 10n via the 22k and 
diode. <br>
<br>

This puts a HIGH on pin 8 for approx 0.7 seconds and when a second 
tap is detected, pin 9 sees a HIGH and pin 10 goes LOW. This puts a 
LOW on pin 12 and a HIGH on pin 8. The LOW on pin 12 goes to pin 1. 
A HIGH and LOW on the second NAND gate produces a HIGH on pin 3 and 
the third NAND gate has a HIGH on both inputs. This makes pin 10 LOW 
and the 4u7 starts to charge via the 2M7 resistor. After 5 seconds 
pin 12 sees a HIGH and pin 11 goes LOW. The 10n is discharged via 
the 10M and when pin 8 sees a LOW, pin 10 goes HIGH. The output sits 
HIGH and goes LOW for about 7 seconds. </td>

LED ZEPPELIN

<br>

This circuit is a game of skill. See full article:

The game consists 
of six LEDs and an indicator LED that flashes at a rate of about 2 
cycles per second. A push button is the &quot;Operations Control&quot; and by 
carefully pushing the button in synchronisation with the flashing 
LED, the row of LEDs will gradually light up.<br>
<br>

But the slightest mistake will immediately extinguish one, two or 
three LEDs. The aim of the game is to illuminate the 6 LEDs with the 
least number of pushes. <br>
<br>

We have sold thousands of these kits. It's a great challenge.

BFO METAL DETECTOR 

<br>
<br>



The circuit shown must represent the limits of simplicity for a 
metal detector. It uses a single 4093 quad Schmitt NAND IC and a 
search coil -- and of course a switch and batteries. A lead from 
IC1d pin 11 needs to be attached to a MW radio aerial, or should be 
wrapped around the radio. If the radio has a BFO switch, switch this 
ON.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Since an inductor resists rapid changes in voltage (called 
reactance), any change in the logic level at IC1c pin 10 is delayed 
during transfer back to input pins 1 and 2. This is further delayed 
through propagation delays within the 4093 IC. This sets up a rapid 
oscillation (about 2 MHz), which is picked up by a MW radio. Any 
change to the inductance of L1 (through the presence of metal) 
brings about a change to the oscillator frequency. Although 2 MHz is 
out of range of the Medium Waves, a MW radio will clearly pick up 
harmonics of this frequency.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

The winding of the coil is by no means critical, and a great deal of 
latitude is permissible. The prototype used 50 turns of 22 awg/30 
swg (0.315 mm) enamelled copper wire, wound on a 4.7&quot;/120 mm former. 
This was then wrapped in insulation tape. The coil then requires a 
Faraday shield, which is connected to 0V. A Faraday shield is a 
wrapping of tin foil around the coil, leaving a small gap so that 
the foil does not complete the entire circumference of the coil. The 
Faraday shield is again wrapped in insulation tape. A connection may 
be made to the Faraday shield by wrapping a bare piece of stiff wire 
around it before adding the tape. Ideally, the search coil will be 
wired to the circuit by means of twin-core or figure-8 microphone 
cable, with the screen being wired to the Faraday shield.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

The metal detector is set up by tuning the MW radio to pick up a 
whistle (a harmonic of 2 MHz). Note that not every such harmonic 
works best, and the most suitable one needs to be found. The 
presence of metal will then clearly change the tone of the whistle. 
The metal detector has excellent stability, and it should detect a 
large coin at 80 to 90 mm, which for a BFO detector is relatively 
good. It will also discriminate between ferrous and non-ferrous 
metals through a rise or fall in tone.<br>

SIMPLE BFO METAL LOCATOR<br>
<br>


 This circuit uses a single 
coil and nine components to make a particularly sensitive low-cost 
metal locator. It works on the principle of a beat frequency 
oscillator (BFO).<br>
<br>

The circuit incorporates two oscillators, both operating at about 
40kHz. The first, IC1a, is a standard CMOS oscillator with its 
frequency adjustable via VR1.<br>
<br>

The frequency of the second, IC1b, is highly dependent on the 
inductance of coil L1, so that its frequency shifts in the presence 
of metal. L1 is 70 turns of 0.315mm enamelled copper wire wound on a 
120mm diameter former. The Faraday shield is made of aluminum foil, 
which is wound around all but about 10mm of the coil and connected 
to pin 4 of IC1b.<br>
<br>

The two oscillator signals are mixed through IC1c, to create a beat 
note. IC1d and IC1c drive the piezo sounder in push-pull fashion, 
thereby boosting the output.<br>
<br>

Unlike many other metal locators of its kind, this locator is 
particularly easy to tune. Around the midpoint setting of VR1, there 
will be a loud beat frequency with a null point in the middle. The 
locator needs to be tuned to a low frequency beat note to one or the 
other side of this null point.<br>
<br>

Depending on which side is chosen, it will be sensitive to either 
ferrous or non-ferrous metals. Besides detecting objects under the 
ground, the circuit could serve well as a pipe locator.<p>

1.5v to 5v PHONE CHARGER<br>
<br>


 Look at the photos. The circuit is simple. It 
looks like two surface-mount transistors, an inductor, diode, 
capacitor, resistor and LED. <br>
<br>

But you will be mistaken. <br>
<br>

One of the &quot;transistors&quot; is a controller and the other is a 
FET. <br>
<br>

The controller is powered from the output (5v) of the circuit 
and when it detects no-load, it shuts down and requires a very small 
current. <br>
<br>

When the 1v5 batter is connected, the controller starts up at less than 
1v5 due to the Schottkey diode and charges the 1u capacitor by 
driving the FET and using the flyback effect of the inductor to 
produce a high voltage. When the output voltage is 5v, the controller 
turns off and the only load on the 1u is the controller. When 
the voltage drops across this capacitor, the controller turns on in bursts to keep the 1u charged 
to 
exactly 5v. The charger was purchased for $3.00 so it is cheaper to 
buy one and use it in your own project. It also comes 
with 4 adapter leads!

Sometimes it is better to use 
something that is already available, rather than trying to 
re-invent the wheel. This is certainly the case with this 
project. You could not buy the components for the cost of 
the complete phone charger and extension leads. <br>
<br>

The circuit 
will deliver 70mA at 5v and if a higher current is drawn, 
the voltage drops slightly. <br>
<br>

These chargers were originally priced at $30.00 !!</td>

10 SECOND ALARM <br>
<br>


 This circuit is activated 
for 10 seconds via the first two gates. They form a LATCH to keep 
the oscillator (made up of the next two gates) in operation, to 
drive the speaker. <br>
<br>

The circuit consumes a few microamps in quiescent mode and the TOUCH 
PLATES can be any type of foil on a door knob or item that is 
required to be protected. The 10u sits in an uncharged condition and 
when the plates are touched, the voltage on pin 1 drops below 50% 
rail and makes pin 3 HIGH. This pulls pins 5 and 6 HIGH and makes 
pin 4 LOW. This keeps pin 3 HIGH, no matter if a HIGH or LOW is on 
pin1. This turns on the oscillator and the 10u starts to charge via 
the 100k resistor. After about 10 seconds, the voltage on pins 5 and 
6 drops to below 50% rail voltage and pin 4 goes HIGH. If the TOUCH 
PLATES are not touched, pin 3 will go LOW and the oscillator 
will stop.

USING A VOLTAGE REGULATOR<br>
<br>


This circuit shows how to use a 
voltage regulator to convert a 24v supply to 12v for a 555 chip. Note: 
the pins on the regulator (commonly called a 3-terminal regulator) are: 
IN, COMMON, OUT and these must match-up with: In, Common, Out on the 
circuit diagram. <br>
<br>

If the current requirement is less than 500mA, a 100R &quot;safety resistor&quot; 
can be placed on the 24v rail to prevent spikes damaging the regulator. <br>

FLASH LEDS FOR 20 SECONDS

 This circuit comes from a 
request from a reader. It flashes a LED for 20 seconds after a 
switch is pressed. In other words, for 20 seconds as soon as the 
switch is pressed. The values will need to be adjusted to get the

INTERCOM<br>
<br>


 
<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Intercom.gif" width="465" height="465">
<div id="maincontent">

This circuit uses a single 
transistor and LM386 amplifier IC to produce an intercom that 
allows hands-free operation. <br>
<br>

As both microphones and loudspeakers are always connected, the 
circuit is designed to avoid feedback - known as the &quot;Larsen 
effect&quot;.<br>
<br>

The microphone amplifier transistor is 180° phase-shifted and 
one of the audio outputs is taken at the collector and its 
in-phase output taken at the emitter. These are mixed by the 
10u, 22u, 20k pot and 2k7 so that the two signals almost cancel 
out. In this way, the loudspeaker will reproduce a very faint 
copy of the signals picked-up by the microphone.<br>
<br>

At the same time, as both collectors of the two intercom units 
are tied together, the 180° phase-shifted signal will pass to 
the audio amplifier of the second unit without attenuation, so 
it will be loudly reproduced by its loudspeaker.<br>
<br>

The same operation will occur when speaking into the microphone 
of the second unit. When the 20k pot is set correctly, almost no 
output will be heard from the loudspeaker but a loud and clear 
reproduction will be heard at the output of the other unit.
The second 20k pot adjusts the volume. </div>

rings for 6 or more rings, the circuit is not activated. <br>
<br>

The circuit takes less than 100uA when in quiescent state and 
when the phone rings, the ring voltage is passed to pin 1 via 
the 100k and 100n capacitor. This causes pin 2 to go HIGH and 
charge two 100u electrolytics. The lower 100u charges in 7 
seconds and the upper charges in 12 seconds. If the phone 
rings for only 3 rings, pin 4 goes LOW and charges the third 
100u via a 47k resistor. After a further 7 seconds, pin 10 goes 
HIGH. If the phone stops ringing after 3 rings, the lower 100u 
starts to discharge via the 470k and after about 40 seconds pin 
4 goes HIGH. The third 100u now starts to discharge via the 470k 
across it and the relay turns off. <br>
<br>

If the phone rings for more than 5 rings, the top 100u will 
charge and pin 6 will go LOW and cause pin 8 to go HIGH and 
prevent pin 11 going LOW via the gating diode.

WATER LEVEL PUMP CONTROLLER
<div id="maincontent1">

This circuit provides automatic level control of a water 
tank.<br>
<br>

The shorter steel rod is the &quot;water high&quot; sensor and the 
longer is the &quot;water low&quot; sensor. When the water level is below 
both sensors, pin 10 is low. If the water comes 
in contact with the longer sensor the output remains low until 
the shorter sensor is reached. At this point pin11 goes 
high and the transistor conducts. The relay is energized and the pump starts 
operating.
When the water level drops the shorter sensor 
will be no longer in contact with the water, but the output of 
the IC will keep the transistor tuned ON until the water falls 
below the level of the longer rod. When the water level falls 
below the longer sensor, the output of the IC goes low and the pump will 
stop.
<br>
<br>

The switch provides reverse operation. 
Switching to connect the transistor to pin 11 ofthe IC 
will cause the 
pump will operate when the tank is nearly empty and will 
stop when the tank is full. In this case, the pump will be 
used to fill the tank and not to empty it.<br>
<br>

Note:

The two steel rods must be supported by a small 
insulated (wooden or plastic) board.
The circuit can be used also with non-metal tanks, 
provided a third steel rod having about the same height as 
the tank is connected to the  
negative.

<br>
<br>

Adding an alarm to pin 11 will let you know the tank is nearly 
empty.

BRAKE LIGHTS
<div id="maincontent2">

This circuit makes the brake lights 
flash a number of times then stay ON. The circuit shows how a 
MOSFET works. The MOSFET is turned on with a voltage between the 
gate and source. This occurs in the circuit when the gate is 
LOW. The P-channel MOSFET can be replaced by a PNP 
transistor with the addition of a 2k2 between the diode and 
base, to prevent the transistor being damaged when output pin 3 
goes LOW. Ideally the PNP transistor should be replaced with a 
Darlington transistor. <br>

ACTIVE FOR 1 SECOND
<div id="maincontent3">

This circuit is active for 1 second 
after it detects a signal on the base of the input transistor. 
The length of activation depends on the value of the 
resistor across the 10u electrolytic. <br>
<br>

When pin 1 goes LOW, pin 2 goes HIGH and charges the 10u. 
Pin 3 goes HIGH, pin 4 goes LOW and pin 6 goes HIGH to turn on 
the transistor and activate the relay. <br>
<br>

At the same time a HIGH is passed to pin 1 to keep it HIGH. <br>
<br>

Pin 2 will be kept LOW and the 10u will discharge via the 
resistor across it and eventually pin 3 will go LOW and the 
relay will turn off. If a signal is still present on the base of 
the input transistor, the relay will remain energised as the 
circuit will charge the 10u again.

THE DOMINO EFFECT
<p>

<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/DominoEffect-1.jpg" width="171" height="657" align="left">
</p>

<div id="maincontent4">

Here's a project with an interesting 
name. The original design was bought over 40 years ago, before 
the introduction of the electret microphone. They used a crystal 
earpiece. <br>
<br>

We have substituted it with a piezo diaphragm and used a quad 
op-amp to produce two building blocks. The first is a high-gain 
amplifier to take the few millivolts output of the piezo and 
amplify it sufficiently to drive the input of a counter chip. 
This requires a waveform of at least 6v for a 9v supply and we 
need a gain of about 600. <br>
<br>

The other building block is simply a buffer that takes the 
high-amplitude waveform and delivers the negative excursions to 
a reservoir capacitor (100u electrolytic). The charge on this 
capacitor turns on a BC557 transistor and this effectively takes 
the power pin of the counter-chip to the positive rail via the 
collector lead.<br>
<br>

The chip has internal current limiting and some of the outputs 
are taken to sets of three LEDs. <br>
<br>

The chip is actually a counter or divider and the frequency 
picked up by the piezo is divided by 128 and delivered to one 
output and 
divided by over 8,000 by the highest-division output to three 
more LEDs The other lines have lower divisions. <br>
<br>

This creates a very impressive effect as the LEDs are connected 
to produce a balanced display that changes according to the beat 
of the music. <br>
<br>

The voltage on the three amplifiers is determined by the 3M3 and 
1M voltage-divider on the first op-amp. It produces about 2v. 
This makes the output go HIGH and it takes pin 2 with it until 
this pin see a few millivolts above pin3. At this point the 
output stops rising. <br>
<br>

Any waveform (voltage) produced by the piezo that is lower than 
the voltage on pin 3 will make the output go HIGH and this is 
how we get a large waveform. <br>
<br>

This signal is passed to the second op-amp and because the 
voltage on pin 6 is delayed slightly by the 100n capacitor, is 
also produces a gain. <br>
<br>

When no signal is picked up by the piezo, pin 7 is approx 2v and 
pin 10 is about 4.5v. Because pin 9 is lower than pin 10, 
the output pin 8 is about 7.7v (1.3v below the supply rail) as 
this is as high as the output will go - it does not go full 
rail-to-rail. <br>
<br>

The LED connected to the output removes 1.7v, plus 0.6v between 
base and emitter and this means the transistor is not turned on.
<br>
<br>

Any colour LEDs can be used and a mixture will give a different 
effect. <br>

project, including photos and construction notes. <br>

10 LED CHASER
<div id="maincontent5">

Here's an interesting circuit that 
creates a clock pulse for a 4017 from a flashing LED. The 
flashing LED takes almost no current between flashes and thus 
the clock line is low via the 1k to 22k resistor. When the LED 
flashes, the voltage on the clock line is about 2v -3v below the 
rail voltage (depending on the value of the resistor) and this 
is sufficient for the chip to see a HIGH. <br>

WHEEL OF FORTUNE
<br>
<br>

Here's a circuit from Vellemann. <br>
<br>

The slow-down circuit consists of the top three gates, R3, D1, C2, 
R4 and C3. <br>
<br>

Sw1 is pressed for a brief period. <br>
<br>

This charges the 47u and the 1u is charged via the 100k. <br>
<br>

The voltage on the 1u rises until it puts a HIGH on input pin 11.<br>
<br>

This puts a LOW on pin 2 and the voltage on the 1u drops until the 
voltage on pin 11 is a LOW. <br>
<br>

The voltage fluctuates at about half rail voltage as it puts a HIGH 
and LOW on Pin 11. It is charged by the 100k and discharged by the 
10 and diode.<br>
<br>

The HIGH on pin 2 allows the 1u to charge via the 100k and this 
gradually reduces the voltage on the 47u. <br>
<br>

As the voltage on the 47u falls, the time taken to charge the 1u 
increases and creates the slow-down effect. Eventually the voltage on 
the 1u is not enough to put a HIGH on Pin 11 and the circuit 
freezes.

TRANSISTOR TESTER COMBO-2
<br>
<br>

The circuit uses a single IC to perform 3 tests:<br>
<br>


Test 1
: Place the transistor in any orientation into the 
three terminals of circuit 1 (below, left) and a red LED will 
detect the base of a PNP transistor an a green LED will indicate 
the base of an NPN transistor. <br>
<br>


Test 2
: You now now the base lead and the type of 
transistor. Place the transistor in Test 2 circuit (top circuit) 
and when you have fitted the collector and emitter leads 
correctly (maybe have to swap leads), the red or green LED will 
come on to prove you have fitted the transistor correctly. <br>
<br>


Test 3
: The transistor can now be fitted in the GAIN 
SECTION. Select PNP or NPN and turn the pot until the LED 
illuminates. The value of gain is marked on the PCB that comes 
with the kit. The kit has ezy clips that clip onto the 
leads of the transistor to make it easy to use the project. <br>
<br>

The project also has a probe at one end of the board that 
produces a square wave - suitable for all sorts of audio 
testing and some digital testing. <br>

GELL CELL BATTERY CHARGER

This circuit will charge gell cell batteries at 300mA or 650mA 
or 1.3A, depending on the CURRENT SENSING resistor in the 0v 
rail. Adjust the 5k pot for 13.4v out and when the battery 
voltage reaches this level, the current will drop to a few 
milliamps. The plug pack will need to be upgraded for the 650mA 
or 1.3A charge-current. The red LED indicates charging and as 
the battery voltage rises, the current-flow decreases. The 
maximum is shown below and when it drops about 5%, the LED turns 
off and the current gradually drops to almost zero.

SIMPLE LOGIC PROBE<br>
<br>


Here is a simple Logic Probe using a single 
chip. The circuits have been designed for the 
CD4001
 CMOS quad 
NOR gate and 
CD4011
 CMOS NAND gate. 
The output has an active buzzer that produces a beep when the 
pulse LED illuminates. The buzzer is not a piezo-diaphragm but an 
active buzzer containing components. It is called an 
electro-mechanical buzzer as it has two coils. The main coil pulls 
the diaphragm to the core via a transistor and the feedback coil 
drives the base. When the transistor is fully saturated, the 
feedback winding does not see any induced voltage (and current) and 
the transistor turns OFF. The rapid action of this oscillator 
produces an annoying squeal. <p align="center">

LONG DURATION TIMER
<div id="maincontent12">


To get a long duration timer we can create an oscillator, called 
a CLOCK OSCILLATOR, and feed it to a number of flip-flops. A 
flip-flop is a form of bi-stable multivibrator, wired so 
an input signal will change the output on every second 
cycle. In other words it divides (halves) the input signal. When 
two of these are connected in a &quot;chain&quot; the input signal  
divides by 4. The CD4060 IC has 14 stages. These are also called 
BINARY DIVIDERS and the chip is also called a COUNTER. <br>
<br>

The IC also has components (called gates or inverters) on pins 
9,10 and 11 that can 
be wired to produce an oscillator. Three external components are 
needed to produce the duration of the oscillations. In other 
words the frequency of the &quot;clock signal.&quot;<br>
<br>

The output of the oscillator is connected (inside the chip) to 
the Binary Dividers and each stage goes HIGH then LOW due to the 
signal it is receiving. Each stage rises and falls at a rate 
that is half the previous stage and the final stage provides the 
long time delay as it takes 2<sup>
13</sup>
 clock cycles before 
going HIGH. We have only taken from Q10 in this circuit and the outline of the chip has been provided in the 
circuit so different outputs can be used to produce different 
timings. <br>
<br>

The diode on the output &quot;jams&quot; the oscillator and stops it 
operating so the relay stays active when the time has expired. <br>

PHONE RINGER


<br>
<br>

This circuit shows how a very complex set of pulses can be 
produced via a very simple circuit. <br>
<br>

The CD4060B IC produce three kinds of pulses. Preset VR1 is 
fine-tuned to get 0.3125Hz pulses at pin 3 of IC1. At the same 
time, pulses obtainable from pin 1 will be of 1.25 Hz and 20 Hz 
at pin 14. The three output pins of IC1 are connected to base 
terminals of transistors T1, T2, and T3 through resistors R1, 
R2, and R3, respectively.<br>
<br>

Working with a built-in oscillator-type piezo buzzer generates 
about 1kHz tone. In this particular circuit, the piezo-buzzer is 
turned on and off at 20 Hz for ring tone sound by transistor 
T3. 20Hz pulses are obtainable at the collector of transistor T3 
for 0.4-second duration. Just after a time interval of 0.4 
second, 20Hz pulses become again obtainable for another 
0.4-second duration. This is followed by two seconds of no sound 
interval. Thereafter the pulse pattern repeats by itself.

Knight 
Rider
 circuit, the 555 is wired as an oscillator. It can be adjusted 
to give the desired speed for the display. The output of the 555 is 
directly connected to the input of a Johnson Counter (CD 4017). The 
input of the counter is called the CLOCK line.<br>
<br>

The 10 outputs Q<sub>
0</sub>
 to Q<sub>
9</sub>
 become active, one at a 
time, on the rising edge of the waveform from the 555.Each output can 
deliver about 20mA but a LED should not be connected to the output 
without a current-limiting resistor (330R in the circuit above).<br>
<br>

The first 6 outputs of the chip are connected directly to the 6 LEDs and 
these &quot;move&quot; across the display. The next 4 outputs move the effect in 
the opposite direction and the cycle repeats. The animation above shows 
how the effect appears on the display.<br>

Using six 3mm LEDs, the display can be placed in the front of a model 
car to give a very realistic effect. The same outputs can be taken to 
driver transistors to produce a larger version of the display.

Here is a simple Knight Rider circuit using resistors to drive the LEDs. 
This circuit consumes 22mA while only delivering 7mA to each LED. The 
outputs are &quot;fighting&quot; each other via the 100R resistors (except outputs 
Q0 and Q5). <br>

KNIGHT RIDER FOR 
HIGH-POWER LEDS (constant current)<br>

This circuit 
provides constant current for high-power LEDs. The battery 
voltage for a car can range from 11v to nearly 16v, depending on 
the state-of-charge and the RPM of the engine. <br>
<br>

This circuit provides constant current so the LEDs are not

A magnet on the train activates the 
TRIGGER reed switch to turn on the amber LED for a time determined by 
the value of the first 10u and 47k. <br>
<br>

When the first 555 IC turns off, the 100n is uncharged because both ends 
are at rail voltage and it pulses pin 2 of the middle 555 LOW. This 
activates the 555 and pin 3 goes HIGH. This pin supplies rail voltage to 
the third 555 and the two red LEDs are alternately flashed. When the 
train passes the CANCEL reed switch, pin 4 of the middle 555 is taken 
LOW and the red LEDs stop flashing.<br>

20mA CONSTANT-CURRENT GENERATOR


<br>
<br>

This circuit produces a constant 20mA current with an output voltage 
approx 3v lower than the battery voltage. <br>
<br>

It uses an LM317 adjustable regulator which has a voltage-drop of 
about 3v between the IN and OUT terminals. If the battery voltage is 12v, the 
circuit will deliver about 9v at 20mA. The regulator has an internal 
voltage reference of 1.25v between OUT and ADJUST pins and when a 
resistor is placed between the OUT pin and the circuit being 
supplied, the current flowing through 
the resistor will produce a voltage-drop. As the current required by 
the circuit increases, the voltage across this resistor will 
increase. When it is 
1.25v, the current will be 20mA. If the current increases due to the output resistance 
decreasing, the voltage across the resistor increases and the LN317 
reduces the output voltage. This causes the current to reduce to 
20mA. This is how the circuit produces a constant current. <br>
<br>

The output current can be changed to any value according to the 
formula shown below. <br>
<br>

<br>

ADJUSTABLE VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LIMITING
<div id="maincontent17">


The single regulator in this circuit will provide a variable 
voltage from 1.225v to 12v or more, depending on the voltage of 
the plug pack and the zener diode. The current will also depend 
on the rating of the plug pack. <br>
<br>

As soon as the current reaches the limit set by the 100R pot, 
the BC547 transistor starts to turn on and rob the regulator of 
voltage on the Adj pin. The output voltage starts to reduce. If 
the output is shorted, the output voltage will reduce to almost 
zero.

THE 74c14 IC
 - also known as 40106 or 40014 - it works 
on 5v to 15v.
<br>
<br>





[But not 7414 or 74HC14 or 74HCT14 or 74LS14 as these IC's are for 5v 
supply ONLY.<br>
<br>

They are TTL chips 
and operate on 4.5v to 5.5v and have low impedance inputs.]<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>

The
 74c14 IC
 is one of the most useful chips on the market. When 
you realise its versatility, you will use it for lots of designs.
<br>
<br>

In this section we describe its capability and provide circuits to 
show how it can be used. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>

Maximum supply voltage 15v<br>
<br>

Max current per output 10mA - 60mA total<br>

</p>


<p align="left">
The output of each gate will deliver about 10mA. 
This is sufficient to drive a LED, but if extra current is required, 
a transistor BUFFER will be needed. For up to 100mA, a BC547 can be 
used. For up to 4 amps a BD679 Darlington transistor can be used. </p>

<p align="center">

<img border="1" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/74c14Buffer.gif" width="365" height="170">
<br>
<br>


<p align="left">

Each gate is a separate &quot;Building Block.&quot; It is basically an 
AMPLIFIER. It is a CURRENT AMPLIFIER and it is different to any other 
type of amplifier. Here is how it works:<br>
<br>

When the input is LOW, the output is HIGH and will deliver 10mA to a 
load. When the input is HIGH the output is LOW and it will sink 10mA 
from a load that is connected to rail. <br>
<br>

Here is the CURRENT AMPLIFYING part: It takes less than 1 
microamp on the input to make the output high or low. <br>
<br>

Here's the second feature of the gate:<br>
<br>

When the input is LOW (A LOW is from 0v to 25% of rail voltage), it 
can be increased slowly or up to a frequency of 4MHz, and when the 
voltage is 66% of rail voltage, the output immediately changes from 
HIGH to LOW. <br>
<br>

When the input is HIGH (from 70% to 100% of rail voltage) and it 
decreases slowly or up to a frequency of 4MHz, the output 
immediately changes from LOW to HIGH when the voltage drops to 33% 
of rail voltage. <br>
<br>

This produces a GAP between 33% and 66% called the HYSTERESIS GAP 
and it prevents noisy input voltages changing the output. The input 
voltage has to rise and/or fall about 33% of rail voltage for the 
output to change. <br>
<br>

There are 6 of the gates in the IC and they are all internally wired 
to the power rails. You can think of the input as having infinite 
impedance (resistance), so it does not put a load on anything 
connected to this pin. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Here is an animation of how the gate works. The input has to be 
above mid-rail for the output to change and below mid-rail for the 
output to change back to its originals state. </p>

<p align="center">

<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Fig4-SchmittOperating.gif" width="160" height="110">
<br>
<br>

</p>

<p align="left">

The next feature to understand is called 

The time delay circuit is also 
know as a &quot;
TIMING CIRCUIT
,&quot; &quot;
DELAY CIRCUIT
,&quot; or &quot;
R-C 
CIRCUIT
&quot;. These names all refer to a CAPACITOR and RESISTOR in 
series. It does not matter if the capacitor is placed above or below 
the resistor as the 
time delay
 will be the same. (The only 
difference will be the value of the voltage at the beginning and end 
of the timing cycle.)<br>
<br>

The join of the two components is the point where the voltage is 
detected and is called the &quot;
Detection Point
.&quot;<br>
<br>

The Detection Point is monitored by a 
Detection Circuit
. This 
will be the input of one of the Schmitt gates. <br>
<br>

The detection circuit 
must not load
 the timing circuit. In 
other words the detection circuit must have a very high input 
impedance. That's the advantage of this IC. It is ideal for 
detecting the voltage on a DELAY CIRCUIT.<br>
<br>

When voltage is applied to a TIMING CIRCUIT, the capacitor begins to 
charge. If we monitor the voltage across the capacitor, we can 
determine when it is at a particular voltage level. It will take a 
PERIOD OF TIME to reach this level and this is the TIME DELAY we 
require.<br>
<br>

In the animation below we see the capacitor charging via a resistor, 
with a meter showing the approx voltage across the capacitor. The 
capacitor does not charge at a constant rate, but this 
characteristic does not concern us at the moment.<br>
<br>

The point to remember is the TIME it takes for the capacitor to 
charge.</p>

</p>

<p align="left">

If we add the TIMING CIRCUIT (DELAY CIRCUIT) to the output of a Schmitt gate, we can 
see the capacitor charging and discharging:</p>

<p align="center">

<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Capcharging-C-complete.gif" width="403" height="197">
</p>

<p align="left">


Here is the clever part
. Instead 
of the voltmeter monitoring the voltage across the capacitor, the 
input of the Schmitt Inverter can be connected to the capacitor.<br>
<br>

If the voltage across the capacitor is less than 66% of rail 
voltage, the output of the gate is HIGH and the capacitor begins to 
charge. When the voltage reaches 67%, the output goes LOW and the 
capacitor begins to discharge. When the voltage across it reaches 
32% of rail voltage, the Schmitt Inverter changes state and the 
output goes HIGH.In this way we need only one gate to create an 
oscillator.<br>
<br>

There are two very important things to observe in the animation 
below.<br>
<br>

1. The output is a square wave. In other words the output goes from 
one state to the other 
VERY QUICKLY
 and this produces the 
characteristic square wave-shape.<br>
<br>

2. The voltage across the capacitor is EXACTLY 32% to 67% of rail 
voltage.<br>
<br>

The animation below shows the gate in operation.<br>
<br>

You will notice that the diagram does not show the chip connected to 
the positive and negative rail. It is 
ASSUMED
 the chip is 
connected to the supply voltage and that's how the output produces 
the HIGH.</p>

Here are the basic oscillator 
blocks for a 74C14 (40106) IC:</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/BasicOscBlocks-1.gif" width="300" border="1" height="150">
<br>
<br>




Fig A shows a capacitor - high frequency oscillator <br>
<br>

Fig B shows an electrolytic - low frequency oscillator
</p>



<p align="left">
An oscillator is created 
by placing a resistor from output to input and a capacitor from 
input to 0v. The output will be a square-wave and and the mark 
(high) will be equal to the space (low).<br>
<br>

The frequency of the output will depend on the value of R and C. 
Values of 1k to 4M7 for R and 100p to 100u for C can be used. This 
is shown in circuits A and B above. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

If an unequal HIGH and LOW is required, a diode is placed between 
output and input:
<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/BasicOscBlocks-2.gif" width="300" border="1" height="175">
</p>

<p align="left">
In figure C the output is output is 
low for a short period of time as the two resistors R1 and R2 are 
discharging the capacitor. If R2 is a very low value compared with 
R1 we can get the low duration to be 10% or less, of the HIGH. <br>
<br>

In figure D the diode is reversed compared to figure C and output is 
high for a short period of time as the two resistors R1 and R2 are 
charging the capacitor. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



Here 
are some basic building blocks:</p>


<p align="center">

<p align="left">

Delay 

<br>
<br>

In the diagram above, the 
input line
 goes HIGH and 
remains HIGH. It can be detecting a piece of equipment being turned 
on, for example. <br>
<br>

This action charges capacitor 
C
 via resistor 
R
. After 
a period of time (called the Delay Time), the input of the Schmitt 
Trigger reaches 67% of rail voltage and the output goes LOW. <br>
<br>

The Delay Time is determined by the values of R and C. We are not 
concerned with the actual values of R and C at this point in time. 
They can be worked out by experimentation. <br>
<br>

The point to note is the placement of the two components to produce a

DELAY
. <br>
<br>

If the output is required to be the opposite of the circuit above, 
an inverter is added:</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Page76-2.gif" border="1" height="130" width="275">
</p>

<p align="left">
If a diode is added across the input resistor, the 
capacitor &quot;C&quot; will be discharged when the input goes low, so the 
&quot;Delay Time&quot; will be instantly available when the input goes HIGH:</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Page76-3.gif" border="1" height="130" width="220">

<p align="left">

Pulse
<br>
<br>

The following circuit produces a PULSE when the 

input line
 goes HIGH:</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Page76-4.gif" border="1" height="130" width="240">
</p>

<p align="left">
To invert the output, add an inverter:</p>

<br>
<br>

</p>

<p align="left">
To produce a pulse after a delay, the following 
circuit is required:</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Page76-6.gif" border="1" height="140" width="350">

<p align="left">

Gating
<br>
<br>

To gate an oscillator via another inverter, a diode is placed 
between the two gates:</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/BasicOscBlocks-3.gif" width="250" border="1" height="200">
</p>

<p align="left">
When the 
push-button is pressed, the input of the first gate goes LOW and the 
output goes HIGH. The high from the diode prevents the capacitor 
discharging via the oscillator and it is &quot;jammed&quot; or &quot;frozen&quot; with 
the output LOW. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The following circuit produces a tone for a short 
period of time as determined by the pulse section. When the output 
of the Pulse section is LOW, the oscillator will operate. When the 
Pulse section is HIGH the oscillator is JAMMED. </p>

<p align="center">

<img src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/Page76-7.gif" border="1" height="140" width="350">

<p>
 <br>
<br>

To 
extend the action of a push button, a pulse-extender circuit can be 
added:</p>

To 
produce a pulse of constant length, (no matter how long the button 
is pressed), the following circuit is needed:</p>

To produce a TOGGLE SWITCH, the following circuit is needed.<br>
<br>

The input of the 40106 has a microscopic 
current availability and over a period of a few hours it will charge 
the 100n and cause the circuit to re-trigger. That's why the 4M7 is 
needed. </span>

2 
MINUTE TIMER
<br>
<br>

The relay is energized for a short time, 2 minutes after the 
push-button is pressed. The push-button produces a brief LOW on pin 
1, no matter how long it is pushed and this produces a pulse of 
constant length via the three components between pin 2 and 3. <br>
<br>

This pulse is long enough to fully discharge the 100u timing 
electrolytic on pin 5. <br>
<br>

The 100k and electrolytic between pins 6 and 9 are designed to 
produce a brief pulse to energize the relay. </p>

The alarm keeps wailing if the door 
is kept open. It only turns off after 5-10 minutes when the door is 
opened and closed. <br>
<br>

The CD4093 is a 
quad 2-input NAND gate
 (with Schmitt Trigger 
input) and each is wired as 
an inverter in this circuit. The Schmitt Trigger feature of the 
input of each gate is not an essential feature in this circuit and 
you can also use a CD4011 
(quad 2-input NAND gate)
 as it does 
not have the Schmitt Trigger feature - and may be easier to buy.<br>
<br>

The first gate (pins 1, 2 and 3) is a timer and the output does not go HIGH 
until the 100u charges via the 470k. This is the Exit/Entry delay. 
When it goes HIGH, the two LEDs are turned ON via the 3k3 resistors. 
This arms the alarm. <br>
<br>

Gate &quot;
B
&quot; (pins 5, 6 and 4) is an inverter that detects when the
 Instant
 input 
is broken and it charges the 100u via the 3k3 resistor. Gate &quot;
C
&quot; 
(pins 8, 9 and 10) detects the charge on the 100u and turns on the BC547 transistor via 
the 4k7 resistor. The 
Instant
 switch can be closed after a 
second as it has done its job of charging the top 100u via the 3k3 
resistor. The circuit is now activated and the siren starts wailing.
The 100u and 4M7 provide the 5-10 minutes timer for the &quot;wailing.&quot;<br>
<br>

The 100u and 2M2 provide the timer for the buzzer 
when you enter. It will buzz for 20 seconds then turn off as the 
entry door has opened and closed and charged the lower 100u.The 
1N4148 only allows the circuit to charge the 100u and when the door 
is closed, the voltage on the anode lead drops to a low value but 
the diode does not allow the 100u to discharge - it only discharges 
via the 2M2. If the 

Exit/Entry
 door is left open, the main siren will wail after 45 seconds. 
Gate &quot;
D
&quot; 
(pins 12, 13 and 11) detects the voltage on the lower 100u and turns 
ON the buzzer. The input of the gate puts no load on the 100u (as it 
has a very high impedance) and it is discharged via the 2M2. <br>
<br>

The piezo buzzer can be a 5v device and a 100R resistor will be 
needed in series with one lead to reduce the volume.

This circuit uses a dedicated alarm chip from Talking 
Electronics (
TE555-BA4
). The chip costs $2.50 and contains a 4-zone 
Burglar Alarm circuit. All you need are the surrounding components 
to complete the project. These components are available as a kit for 
$20.00 including the dedicated chip and this makes it one 
of the cheapest kits on the market (postage for kit $6.50). Click

<p>


Build the circuit on a piece of matrix board (or the Circuit 
Board included in the 
kit) and connect the inputs to the screw terminals. 6 separate 
2-screw terminals are provided in the kit to make it easy to wire-up 
the alarm. The alarm takes about 1mA when monitoring a house and 
about 100mA when activated. <br>
<br>

The siren is only activated ONCE for 5 minutes when a break-in 
occurs as this is the maximum allowable time for a siren to wail in 
Australia. <br>
<br>

If you want the alarm to constantly wail after a break-in, push  
button A when the alarm is turned on (and the exit beep is being 
produced). The constantly wailing 
LED will flash. Push the button again and the 5 minute LED will 
flash. The button toggles 
between the two features. <br>
<br>

You can use reed switches for the input devices for doors and 
drawers. You can also trap the burglar by placing money under a clip 
and have a very thin length of tinned copper wire wound around two 
pins. When the money is removed, the wire is pulled off the pins. A 
single strand of wire can be obtained from a length of hook-up flex. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

The alarm can be connected to a 12v gell cell with a rating of 
1.2AHr and it can be automatically charged using our

Any of the inputs can be used for the Entry/Exit. <br>
<br>

It is connected to the door you will use to enter 
or exit the property. The alarm gives you 45 seconds to exit. <br>
<br>

When you enter the property, the buzzer turns on as soon as you open 
the door and beeps for 45 seconds to allow you to turn off the 
alarm. <br>
<br>

If the alarm is not turned off, the main piezo siren produces a soft 
tone for 30 seconds and then 
a piercing wailing sound.

<p>
This allows you to turn off the alarm before the loud wailing is 
produced and is one of the best features of the alarm as the worry 
of false-triggering an alarm prevents many householders setting 
their alarm. <br>
<br>

Any unused inputs must be connected with a link so 
the alarm can be set. <br>
<br>

When the circuit is turned ON, you have 45 seconds to exit the 
premises. <br>
<br>

The chip then flashes either the 5-min LED or the Constant LED 
to indicate if the siren will wail for 5 minutes or constantly. You 
can change the setting by pressing the button. The circuit then 
beeps for 45 seconds to give you time to exit the property. It then 
monitors all 4 inputs.</p>

The main chip contains an internal oscillator to drive a piezo diaphragm 
and also a wailing oscillator for the Piezo Siren. The Piezo Siren 
is an 80dB piezo diaphragm driven by a BD679 Darlington transistor 
with a 10mH choke to produce a high voltage for the diaphragm. <br>
<br>

The chip operates on 5v and the rest of the circuit uses 12v. A very 
simple voltage-dropper consisting of 2 LEDs and 1k5 drops the 12v to 
5v.

BATTERY-LOW BEEPER

<br>
<br>

This circuit will produce a beep-beep-beep from the piezo buzzer when the 
battery voltage falls to about 10v. <br>
<br>

This is very handy when you have a battery powering a piece of 
equipment and you don't know its state of charge. <br>
<br>

When the voltage is above 10v, the zener diode conducts and turns ON 
the first transistor. The voltage between the collector and emitter 
of this transistor is less than 0.3v and the voltage on the base of 
the second transistor is 0.3v. Thus the second transistor is not 
turned ON and it is effectively removed from the circuit. This means 
the reset pin of the CD 4060 is connected to the positive rail via a 
1M resistor. This puts a HIGH on the reset pin and turns the chip 
off and prevents the oscillator producing clock pulses. <br>
<br>

The chip contains inverters between pins 9, 10 and 11 so that when 
components are connected to these pins, an oscillator is produced. 
<br>
<br>

The technical name for this oscillator is called a CLOCK. <br>
<br>

When pin 12 is taken HIGH it inhibits the oscillator (prevents the 
clock pulses passing to the divider stages). <br>
<br>

When the battery voltage falls below 10v, the first transistor 
is turned OFF and the second transistor is turned ON. This takes the 
reset line to the 0v rail and the chip allows the clock pulses from 
the oscillator to pass to a set of flip flops arranged to divide the 
signal. Pin 7 divides the signal by 16 to produce a beep-beep-beep 
from the electro-mechanical buzzer. The buzzer normally produces a constant tone 
but output pin 7 goes HIGH/LOW at about one cycle per second and 
this turns the buzzer ON and OFF to produce a clearer alert signal.
<br>
<br>

The circuit takes 30uA when &quot;sitting around&quot; and less than 1mA when 
producing a beep. <br>
<br>

If you do not have an electro-mechanical buzzer, a piezo diaphragm can be used. 
The output volume will not be as loud. The oscillator components 
will need to be changed to produce a higher clock frequency. 
This frequency will be divided-down and detected at one or two of 
the outputs. You can try all the outputs to see what result is the 
best. <br>
<br>

<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/BatteryLowBeeper-2.gif" width="405" height="300">
</div>
<br>
<br>

If you do not have a 9v1 zener, it can 
be made from 5v6 zener and 3v6 zener or a 5v6 and a white LED or two 
red LEDs. <br>
<br>

It can also be made from three white LEDs and a red LED. <br>
<br>

You can use a zener, LEDs and a signal diode to adjust the voltage 
to any desired value. <br>
<br>

When a very small current flows though a zener, LED or diode, the 
characteristic voltage that develops across it is LESS than when its 
rated current flows. However this lower voltage can be used to 
produce a &quot;trigger-point.&quot; The only way to determine this voltage is 
to add the component to the circuit.<br>
<br>

The first transistor reacts at this trigger-point and the second 
transistor simply inverts the voltage on the collector. <br>
<br>

The second transistor is not classified as an amplifier but an 
INVERTER. <br>

A SIMPLER CIRCUIT:
<br>
<br>

The circuit above can be simplified and output Pin 12 can be used to 
illuminate two of the LEDs as this line is HIGH for the times when 
Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are HIGH and goes LOW when Q5 - Q9 is HIGH.
<br>
<br>

This means the 4017 starts with Q0 HIGH. But Q0 is not an output. 
This means that when Q0 is HIGH, &quot;carry out&quot; is HIGH and &quot;2&quot; will be 
displayed. The next clock cycle will produce &quot;3&quot; on the display when 
Q1 is HIGH, then &quot;4&quot; when Q2 is HIGH, &quot;5&quot; when Q3 is HIGH and &quot;6&quot; 
when Q4 is HIGH. When Q5 goes HIGH, it illuminates &quot;1&quot; on the 
display because &quot;carry out&quot; goes LOW.

WATER LEVEL DETECTOR


<br>
<br>

This  great project is available on eBay for about $6.00 
(posted). It shows LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH on LEDs as well as a relay 
output. See the <a href="WATER%20LEVEL%20DETECTOR.pdf" target="top">
.pdf 
for full details</a>
. <br>
<br>

Here is the circuit:<br>
<br>

<img border="0" src="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/WaterDetectorCCt.gif" width="635" height="480">
<br>
<br>

The circuit is complex because it is well-designed and does not put 
DC on the probes. The AC prevents galvanic reaction &quot;eating&quot; the 
probes and destroying them. <br>
<br>

The switch in the base of the first transistor effectively &quot;toggles&quot; 
(reverses) the action of the relay. You don't really need this 
complexity as you can simply wire your motor to the normally-open or 
normally-closed contacts. <br>
<br>

However the circuit is a good introduction to op-amp designs and the 
full explanation of how it works is in the .pdf. <br>
<br>

The circuit has been redrawn from the Chinese original to make it 
easy to see how it works. You have absolutely no chance of working 
out how it works from the Chinese version. I don't know how they 
teach electronics with their way of laying things out. I 
certainly couldn't follow anything. It was all &quot;Chinese&quot; (Greek) to 
me. <br>

The resistor values have been added to the image as they are hidden 
under the components. If the project does not work, you will find 
two resistors have been fitted incorrectly. This photo will help you 
locate the problem. The colour bands for each resistor is in the .pdf. 
They are all 1% resistors and you need help to check the colours. </div>

Don't forget, the 223 looks the same as 104.

DOOR ALARM 
<br>
<br>

This  circuit produces two different effects on the LED. It is 
best to put a piezo diaphragm on pin 11 to hear the tone (frequency) 
produced by the circuit. <br>
<br>

The circuit is a good example to test your ability to work out what 
is happening. <br>
<br>

When the magnet is near the Hall effect device, the output is LOW 
and pin 3 must be HIGH (refer to the truth table). This puts a high on pin 2 and the gate 
remains in this state.<br>
<br>

Pin 4 is LOW and pin 10 is HIGH. <br>
<br>

Pin 11 can be high or low and if we assume the 100n is not charged, 
pin 13will be low and the output will be HIGH. This will charge the 
100n and change pin 13 to HIGH to make the output LOW and thus we 
have an oscillator. The piezo diaphragm will produce a tone but the 
LED will simply be illuminated.<br>
<br>

When the magnet is removed, pin 1 goes HIGH andthe output can 
be high or low. We will assume pin 3 goes LOW as it was previously 
HIGH and the 10u was fully charged. <br>
<br>

Pin 4 goes HIGH and the 10u is &quot;jacked up&quot; by 9v due to pin 4 rising 
and the about 8v contained in (or on) the 10u puts 17v on the join 
of the 1M and 100k resistors. <br>
<br>

The other end of the 100k is at 0v and this resistor discharges the 
10u fully and then starts to charge it in the opposite direction as 
the negative of the electro will be at 9v and the positive lead has 
to drop to less than 3v. Pin 2 monitors the voltage via the 1M 
resistor. <br>
<br>

When pin 2 sees less than 3v, the gate changes state with pin 2 
going HIGH and the second gate changes state with pin 4 going LOW.
<br>
<br>

The electro has MINUS 6v across it but the way to see it is this: 
The electro is &quot;moved down&quot; by 9v and now the join of the 1M and 
100k resistors sees a voltage of minus 15v. <br>
<br>

The other end of the 100k resistor has 9v on it and this removes the 
charge from the electro so that it has 0v across it and then it 
charges in the correct direction until the voltage reaches about 6v.
<br>
<br>

At this point the gate changes state with pin 3 going LOW and pin 4 
going HIGH to create a low frequency oscillator. <br>
<br>

Previously pins 4, 8 and 9 were LOW. <br>
<br>

When these pins are HIGH, pin 10 is LOW. When this pin is LOW it 
permanently puts a HIGH on the output of the gate and the LED is 
turned OFF. <br>
<br>

This makes the LED blink when the magnet is removed.<p>

Circuit Symbols<br>
<br>



The list below covers 
almost every symbol you will find on an electronic circuit 
diagram. It allows you to identify a symbol and also draw 
circuits. It is a handy reference and has some symbols that 
have never had a symbol before, such as a Flashing LED and 
electroluminescence panel. <br>
<br>

Once you have identified a symbol on a diagram you will need 
to refer to specification sheets to identify each lead on 
the actual component. <br>
<br>

The symbol does not identify the actual pins on the device. 
It only shows the component in the circuit and how it is 
wired to the other components, such as input line, output, 
drive lines etc. You cannot relate the shape or size of the 
symbol with the component you have in your hand or on the 
circuit-board. <br>
<br>

Sometimes a component is drawn with each pin in the same 
place as on the chip etc. But this is rarely the case. <br>
<br>

Most often there is no relationship between the position of 
the lines on the circuit and the pins on the component. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Thats what makes reading a circuit so complex. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

This is very important to remember with transistors, voltage 
regulators, chips and so many other components as the 
position of the pins on the symbol are not in the same 
places as the pins or leads on the component and sometimes the pins 
have different functions according to the manufacturer. 
Sometimes the pin numbering is different according to the 
component, such as positive and negative regulators. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

You must to refer to the manufacturers specification sheet 
to identify each pin, to be sure you have identified them 
correctly. <br>

IC PINOUTS<br>
<br>


The following list covers just a few of the IC's on the 
market and these are the &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;basic&quot; or 
&quot;digital&quot; or &quot;op-amp&quot; IC's suitable for experimenting.
<br>
<br>

When designing a circuit around an IC, you have to remember 
two things: <br>
<br>

1. Is the IC still available? and <br>
<br>

2. Can the circuit be designed around a microcontroller?<br>
<br>

Sometimes a circuit using say 3 or 4 IC's can be re-designed 
around an 8-pin or 16-pin microcontroller and the program can be be 
kept from prying eyes due to a feature called &quot;code 
protection.&quot; A microcontroller project is more 
up-to-date, can be cheaper and can be re-programmed to alter 
the features. <br>
<br>

This will be covered in the next eBook. It is worth 
remembering - as it is the way of the future. </div>
