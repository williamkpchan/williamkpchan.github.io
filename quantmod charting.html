Most of the charting functionality is designed to be used interactively.
Running from a script requires a bit of extra care, but is now possible as well.
</p><p>
<h3 id="chartseries">Introducing chartSeries</h3>
<b>chartSeries</b> is the main function doing all the work
in quantmod. Courtesy of <em>as.xts</em> it can handle
any object that is time-series like, meaning <b>R</b> objects of class <b>xts</b>,
<b>zoo</b>, <b>timeSeries</b>, <b>its</b>, <b>ts</b>, <b>irts</b>, and more!
</p>
<p>
By default any series that <b>is.OHLC</b> is charted as an OHLC series.
There is a <em>type</em> argument which allows the user to decide on the
style to be rendered: traditional bar-charts, candle-charts, and matchstick-charts
-- thin candles ... get it :) -- as well as line charts.
</p>
<p>
The default choice ['auto'] lets the software decide, <br>
candles where they'd be visible clearly, <br>
matchsticks if many points are being charted, <br>
and lines if the series isn't of an OHLC nature.  <br>
<br>
If you don't like to always specify the type
to override this behavior you are free to use the wrapper functions in the
next section, or make use of <b>setDefaults</b> from the wickedly cool and useful
<b>Defaults</b> package (available on CRAN).
The fact that I wrote it has nothing to do with my
endorsement :)
<span class="Rcode">

<br />
<br />&gt; # notice the automatic matchstick style 
<br />&gt; # we'll change this in the next section
<br />&gt; # but for now it is fine.
<br />&gt; 
 </span>
The basic charting functionality tries to not stray too far from the
standard usage patterns in <b>R</b>, though you will not be able to use
any of the standard graphics tools for displaying charts. quantmod's
oh-so-wise author has tried to anticipate that need with special
functions to make up for this shortcoming.
</p>
<p>
A quick step back, to explain just what is happening behind the scenes within
<b>chartSeries</b> may be in order though.
</p>
<p>
The charting is managed through a two step process. First, the data is examined
and basic decisions on how to best draw the series is calculated.  The result of
this is an internal object - referred to as a <b>chob</b> (<u>ch</u>art <u>ob</u>ject).
</p>
<p>
This object is then passed to the main drawing function (not to be called directly)
to be drawn to the screen. The purpose of the separation is to allow for more
impressive dynamic-style chart additions, as well as modifications, to be as
natural to accomplish as possible.  When changes are made to the current chart - be
it adding technical indicators, or changing original parameters, such as the style of
chart - the stored <b>chob</b> object is simply altered and then redrawn without
a lot of tedious user manipulation.  The goal was to make it work without
extra user effort - and to then end
it just <em>does</em>.
</p>
<h3 id="redword">Charting shortcuts - barChart, lineChart, and candleChart.</h3>
<p>
While chartSeries is the primary function called when drawing a
chart in quantmod - it is by no means the only way to get something
done. There are wrapper functions for each of the main types of
charts presently available in quantmod.
</p>
<p>
Wrapper functions exist to make life a little easier.  Bar style charts,
both <em>hlc</em> and <em>ohlc</em> varieties are directly available
with <b>barChart</b>, candlestick charting comes naturally through
the <span id="yellowword">candleChart</span> wrapper function, and lines via the cryptically
named - you guessed it - <b>lineChart</b>.  There isn't much special
about these functions beyond the obvious.  In fact they are one liners
that simply call <b>chartSeries</b> with suitably changed default args.
But they make a nice addition to the stable.
</p>
<span class="Rcode">
<br />&gt; # first some high-low-close style bars, monochromatic theme
<br />&gt; <span id="whiteword">barChart(GS,theme='white.mono',bar.type='hlc') </span>
<br />
<br />
<img alt='GS hlc barchart chart' class='chartthumb' src='GS-hlc-bars-white-mono-thumb.png' />
<br />
<br />&gt; # how about some candles, this time with color
<br />&gt; candleChart(GS,multi.col=TRUE,theme='white')
<br />
<br />
<img alt='GS candle chart' class='chartthumb' src='GS-candles-thumb.png' />
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; # and now a line, with the default color scheme
<br />&gt; lineChart(GS,line.type='h',TA=NULL)
<br />
<br />
<img alt='GS line chart' class='chartthumb' src='GS-linechart-thumb.png' />
 </span>
<p>
As you can see, there is quite a bit of flexibility as to the display
of your information.  What you may have also noticed is the different arguments
to each of the calls.  We'll now take a look at what some of them
do.
</p>
<h3 id="arguments">Formal Arguments: Colors, subsetting, tick-marks.</h3>
<p>
The best place for complete information on what arguments the functions
take is in the documentation.  But for now we'll take a look at some of the common
options you might change.
</p>
<p>
Probably the most important from a usability standpoint is the
argument <b>subset</b>.  This takes an xts/ISO8601 style time-based string
and restricts the plot to the date/time range specified. This
doesn't restrict the data available to the techinical analysis functions, only
restricts the content drawn to the screen.  For this reason it is most advantageous
to use as much data as you have available, and then provide the chartSeries
function with the subset which you would like to view.  This subsetting
is also avialable via a call to <b>zoomChart</b>.
</p>
<p>
An example, or three, should help clarify its usage.
</p>

<br />&gt; # also changing the x-axis labeling

<br />&gt; candleChart(GS,theme='white', type='candles')
<br />&gt; reChart(major.ticks='months',subset='first 16 weeks')
<br />

</a>
 </span>
<p>
Three things of note on the last chart.  First was the use of <b>reChart</b>
to modify the original chart.  This takes most arguments of the original
charting calls, and allows for quick modifications to your charts. Be it
changing color themes or subsetting - it comes in quite handy.
</p>
<p>
The second notable item is the use of the 'first' syntax inside of subset.
This allows for a slightly more natural expression of what you may be
after, and doesn't require you to know anything about the series dates or times.
</p>
<p>
The final item of note in that last image is the <b>tick.marks</b> argument.
This is part of the original chartSeries function formals list, and it
is used to modify the placement of labels within the chart.  Often the automatically
chosen spacing - driven by the xts function <b>axTicksByTime</b> does a good
enough job - you may find it desirable to customize the output further.  In this
case we marked the major ticks with the months beginnings.
</p>
<h3 id="technicals">Technical Analysis and chartSeries</h3>
<p>
Updated and ready to go are some fantastic tools from the <a href="http://ttr.r-forge.r-project.org">TTR</a>
package by <a href="http://quantemplation.blogspot.com">Josh Ulrich</a>, available on CRAN. It is now
possible to <em>simply</em> add <u>dozens</u> of technical analysis tools to chart
with nothing more than a simple command.
</p>
<p>
The current indicators from the TTR package, as well as a few originating in the quantmod package
are:

<p>
All of the above work much like the TTR base functions
on which they call. The primary difference is that the
<b>add</b> family of calls do not include the
data argument, as this is derived from the current chart. 
</p>
<p>
A few examples will highlight how to build
charts with the built-in indicators.

<p>
One of the newest and most exciting additions to the
recent <b>quantmod</b> release includes two new
charting tools designed to make adding custom
indicators far quicker than previously possible.
</p>
<p>
The first of these is <b>addTA</b>. This is
a major extension to the previous addTA function,
in that it now allows for arbitrary data to be drawn
on the charts. Acting as essentially a wrapper
to your data, the only requirement is that the
data have the same number of observations as the original, or
be of class <b>xts</b> and the dates are within the original
data's time range and scale. It is possible to 
have this new data plotted in its own TA
subchart (the default), or overlayed on the main series.
</p>
<p>
The second and potentially more interesting function
is <b>newTA</b>.  This is the long-awaited skeleton
function to create custom TA indicators to be appended
to any chart. 
It takes the skeleton concept one step further, and dynamically
creates the function code needed for a new indicator, based on
the function you passed to it.  Essentially a
bit of self-aware programming makes adding new indicators
quite intuitive and practically painless.  Given it's rather cutting edge
abilities, it is on the cusp of experimental.  Luckily if
all else fails, and what you get is not what you expected, you
can always modify the code created to better suit your needs.
</p>
<p>

a new indicator from scratch.
