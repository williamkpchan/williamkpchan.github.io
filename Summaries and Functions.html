 <h2>Data Summaries</h2>
We've looked at a few graphical techniques for exploring data, and now we're going
to turn to a numerical one.  Consider the question "Which day of the week has the 
highest average box office for hit movies released on that day?".  As a first step
in answering that question, it would be helpful to look at the mean box office
receipts for each of the days.  If you look for a function to do that specific 
task, you probably wouldn't find one, because R takes the more general approach of 
providing a function that will allow you to calculate anything you want from vectors
of values broken down by groups.  In fact, there are a variety of ways to do this.
The one we're going to look at is called <tt>aggregate</tt>.   You pass <tt>aggregate</tt>
a vector or data frame containing the variables you want to summarize, a list of 
the groups to summarize by, and the function you'd like to use for your summaries.
That way, a single function can perform many tasks, and, as we'll see when we
learn to write functions, it even allows R to do things that the developers of 
R never imagined.  For now, we'll stick to some built in functions, like 
<tt>mean</tt>.  To find the means for the box office receipts for each day of the 
week, we could use a call to aggregate like this:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;aggregate(movies$box,movies['weekday'],mean)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weekday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;126.7766
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;104.8419
3&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;127.1272
4&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;104.0686
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;102.6522
6&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;&nbsp;82.2441
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;103.0268

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The same thing could be done to calculate other statistics, like <tt>median</tt>,
<tt>min</tt>, <tt>max</tt>, or any statistic that returns a single scalar value
for each group.  Another nice feature of <tt>aggregate</tt> is that it if the 
first argument is a data frame, it will calculate the statistic  for each column
of the data frame.  If we passed <tt>aggregate</tt> both the <tt>rank</tt> and
<tt>box</tt>, we'd get two columns of summaries:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;aggregate(movies[,c('rank','box')],movies['weekday'],mean)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weekday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box
&#62;&nbsp;aggregate(movies[,c('Rank','box')],movies['weekday'],mean)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weekday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;443.1538&nbsp;126.7766
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;511.7037&nbsp;104.8419
3&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;455.0116&nbsp;127.1272
4&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;560.5122&nbsp;104.0686
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;520.0766&nbsp;102.6522
6&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;596.1000&nbsp;&nbsp;82.2441
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;497.6667&nbsp;103.0268

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To add a column of counts to the table, we can create a data frame from
the <tt>table</tt> function, and merge it with the aggregated results:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;dat&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregate(movies[,c('Rank','box')],movies['weekday'],mean)
&#62;&nbsp;cts&nbsp;=&nbsp;as.data.frame(table(movies$weekday))
&#62;&nbsp;head(cts)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Var1&nbsp;Freq
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27
3&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;&nbsp;172
4&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;744
6&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To make the merge simpler, we rename the first column of <tt>cts</tt> to 
<tt>weekday</tt>.

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;names(cts)[1]&nbsp;=&nbsp;'weekday'
&#62;&nbsp;res&nbsp;=&nbsp;merge(cts,dat)
&#62;&nbsp;head(res)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weekday&nbsp;Freq&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;744&nbsp;520.0766&nbsp;102.6522
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;443.1538&nbsp;126.7766
3&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;596.1000&nbsp;&nbsp;82.2441
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;497.6667&nbsp;103.0268
5&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41&nbsp;560.5122&nbsp;104.0686
6&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27&nbsp;511.7037&nbsp;104.8419

</pre>
Finally, we can order the columns as follows:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;res[order(res$weekday),]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weekday&nbsp;Freq&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;443.1538&nbsp;126.7766
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27&nbsp;511.7037&nbsp;104.8419
7&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;&nbsp;172&nbsp;455.0116&nbsp;127.1272
5&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41&nbsp;560.5122&nbsp;104.0686
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;744&nbsp;520.0766&nbsp;102.6522
3&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;596.1000&nbsp;&nbsp;82.2441
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;497.6667&nbsp;103.0268

</pre>

 <h2>Functions</h2>
As you've already noticed, functions play an important role in R.  A very 
attractive feature of R is that you can write your own functions which 
work exactly the same as the ones that are part of the official R release.
In fact, if you create a function with the same name as one that's already
part of R, it will override the built-in function, and possibly cause 
problems.  For that reason, it's a good idea to make sure that there's not
already another function with the name you want to use.  If you type the
name you're thinking of, and R responds with a message like 
"<tt>object "xyz"</tt> not found" you're probably safe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are several reasons why creating your own functions is a good idea.

<ol type="1">
<li>If you find yourself writing the same code over and over again as you work on
different problems, you can write a function that incorporates whatever it is
you're doing and call the function, instead of rewriting the code over and over.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
All of the functions you create are saved in your workspace along with your data.
So if you put the bulk of your work into functions that you create, R will 
automatically save them for you (if you tell R to save your workspace when your
quit.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
It's very easy to write "wrappers" around existing functions to make a custom
version that sets the arguments to another function to be just what you want.
R provides a special mechanism to "pass along" any extra arguments the other
function might need.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
You can pass your own functions to built-in R functions like <tt>aggregate</tt>,
<tt>by</tt>, <tt>apply</tt>, <tt>sapply</tt>, <tt>lapply</tt>, <tt>mapply</tt>,
<tt>sweep</tt> and other functions to efficiently and easy perform customized
tasks.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Before getting down to the details of writing your own functions, it's a good idea
to understand how functions in R work.  Every function in R has a set of arguments that
it accepts.  You can see the arguments that built-in functions take in a number of ways:
viewing the help page, typing the name of the function in the interpreter, or using the
<tt>args</tt> function.  When you call a function, you can simply pass it arguments,
in which case they must line up exactly with the way the function is designed, or 
you can specifically pass particular arguments in whatever order you like by providing
the with names using the <tt>name=value</tt> syntax.   You also can combine the two,
passing unnamed arguments (which have to match the function's definition exactly), 
followed by named arguments in whatever order you like.
For example, consider the function <tt>read.table</tt>.  We can view its argument list
with the command:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;args(read.table)
function&nbsp;(file,&nbsp;header&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE,&nbsp;sep&nbsp;=&nbsp;"",&nbsp;quote&nbsp;=&nbsp;"\"'",&nbsp;dec&nbsp;=&nbsp;".",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;row.names,&nbsp;col.names,&nbsp;as.is&nbsp;=&nbsp;!stringsAsFactors,&nbsp;na.strings&nbsp;=&nbsp;"NA",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colClasses&nbsp;=&nbsp;NA,&nbsp;nrows&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;skip&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;check.names&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fill&nbsp;=&nbsp;!blank.lines.skip,&nbsp;strip.white&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE,&nbsp;blank.lines.skip&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment.char&nbsp;=&nbsp;"#",&nbsp;allowEscapes&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE,&nbsp;flush&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stringsAsFactors&nbsp;=&nbsp;default.stringsAsFactors(),&nbsp;encoding&nbsp;=&nbsp;"unknown")
NULL

</pre>
 This argument list tells us that, if we pass unnamed arguments to 
<tt>read.table</tt>, it will interpret the first as <tt>file</tt>, the next as 
<tt>header</tt>, then <tt>sep</tt>, and so on.  Thus if we wanted to read the 
file <tt>my.data</tt>, with <tt>header</tt> set to <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>sep</tt>
set to <tt>','</tt>, any of the following calls would be equivalent:

<pre>
read.table('my.data',TRUE,',')
read.table(sep=',',TRUE,file='my.data')
read.table(file='my.data',sep=',',header=TRUE)
read.table('my.data',sep=',',header=TRUE)

</pre>
 Notice that all of the arguments in the argument list for <tt>read.table</tt>
have values after the name of the argument, except for the <tt>file</tt> argument.  This
means that <tt>file</tt> is the only required argument to <tt>read.table</tt>; any of the 
other arguments are optional, and if we don't specify them the default values that appear
in the argument list will be used.
Most R functions are written so the the 
first few arguments will be the ones that will usually be used so that their
values can be entered without providing names, with the other arguments being optional.
Optional arguments can be passed to a function by position, but are much more commonly 
passed using the <tt>name=value</tt> syntax, as in the last example of calling 
<tt>read.table</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now let's take a look at the function <tt>read.csv</tt>.  You may recall that this 
function simply calls <tt>read.table</tt> with a set of parameters that makes sense
for reading comma separated files.  Here's <tt>read.csv</tt>'s function definition,
produced by simply typing the function's name at the R prompt:

<pre>
function&nbsp;(file,&nbsp;header&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE,&nbsp;sep&nbsp;=&nbsp;",",&nbsp;quote&nbsp;=&nbsp;"\"",&nbsp;dec&nbsp;=&nbsp;".",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fill&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE,&nbsp;comment.char&nbsp;=&nbsp;"",&nbsp;...)
read.table(file&nbsp;=&nbsp;file,&nbsp;header&nbsp;=&nbsp;header,&nbsp;sep&nbsp;=&nbsp;sep,&nbsp;quote&nbsp;=&nbsp;quote,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dec&nbsp;=&nbsp;dec,&nbsp;fill&nbsp;=&nbsp;fill,&nbsp;comment.char&nbsp;=&nbsp;comment.char,&nbsp;...)
&lt;environment:&nbsp;namespace:utils&#62;

</pre>
Pay special attention to the three periods (<tt>...</tt>) in the argument list.  Notice 
that they also appear in the call to <tt>read.table</tt> inside the function's body.
The three dots mean all the arguments that were passed to the function that didn't
match any of the previous arguments in the argument list.  So if you pass
anything other than <tt>file</tt>, <tt>header</tt>, <tt>sep</tt>, <tt>quote</tt>,
<tt>dec</tt>, or <tt>fill</tt> to <tt>read.csv</tt>, it will be part of the three dots;
by putting the three dots at the end of the argument list in the call to 
<tt>read.table</tt>, all those unmatched arguments are simply passed along to
<tt>read.table</tt>.  So if you make a call to <tt>read.csv</tt> like this:

<pre>
read.csv(filename,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

</pre>
 the <tt>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</tt> will get passed to <tt>read.table</tt>, even though
it wasn't explicitly named in the argument list.  Without the three dots, R will not
accept any arguments that aren't explicitly named in the argument list of the function
definition.  If you want to intercept the extra arguments yourself, you can include
the three dots at the end of the argument list when you define your function, and 
create a list of those arguments inside the function body by refering to <tt>list(...)</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Suppose you want to create a function that will call <tt>read.csv</tt> with a filename,
but which will automatically set the <tt>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</tt> parameter.  For maximum 
flexibility, we'd want to be able to pass other arguments (like <tt>na.strings=</tt>, 
or <tt>quote=</tt>) to <tt>read.csv</tt>, so we'll include the three dots at the end of
the argument list.  We could name the function <tt>read.csv</tt> and overwrite the built-in
version, but that's not a good idea, if for no other reason than the confusion it would
cause if someone else tried to understand your programs!  Suppose we call the function
<tt>myread.csv</tt>.  We could write a function definition as follows:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;myread.csv&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(file,stringsAsFactors=FALSE,...){
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read.csv(file,stringsAsFactors=stringsAsFactors,...)
+&nbsp;}

</pre>
Now, we could simply use

<pre>
thedata&nbsp;=&nbsp;myread.csv(filename)

</pre>
 to read a comma-separated file with <tt>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</tt>.  You could still pass
any of <tt>read.table</tt>'s arguments to the function (including <tt>stringsAsFactors=TRUE</tt> if
you wanted), and, if you ask R to save your workspace when you quit, the function will be
available to you next time you start R in the same directory.
